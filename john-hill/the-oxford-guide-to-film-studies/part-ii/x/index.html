        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dougias Kellner</h3>
        <p>Film emerged as one of the first mass-produced cultural forms of the twentieth century. Based on new  technologies of mechanical reproduction that made  possible simulations of the real and the production of  fantasy worlds, film provided a new mode of culture  that changed patterns of leisure activity and played an  important role in social life. From the beginning, film in  the United States was a mode of commercial activity  controlled by entertainment industries that attempted  to attract audiences to its products. Film production  was accordingly organized on an industrial model and  manufactured a mass-produced output aimed at capturing a secure audience share and thus realizing a  substantial profit. As a commercial enterprise, American film developed as an entertainment industry,  rather than as an educational instrument or art form  (Horkheimer and Adorno 1972).</p>
        <p>Film soon became the most popular and influential form of media culture in the United States (Sklar 1 975;  Jowett 1976). Indeed, for the first half of the twentieth  century—from 1896 to the 1950s—movies were a central focus of leisure activity and deeply influenced how  people talked, looked, and acted, becoming a major  force of enculturation. The number of theatres grew  from about 10.000 store-front nickelodeons with daily  ettendance of 4 to 5 million in 1910 to around 28.000  movie theatres by 1928 (May 1983). In the 1920s the  average audience was between 25 and 30 million customers a week, while by the 1930s from 85 to 110  million people paid to go to the movies each week  (Dieterle 1941). Consequently, films were a central  form of entertainment and an extremely popular leisure activity.</p>
        <p>Moreover, films became a major force of socialization, providing role models and instruction in dress and  fashion, in courtship and love, and in marriage andcareer. Early films were produced largely for working-class, immigrant, and urban audiences and it was  believed films could help to ‘<span>Americanize</span>’ immigrants  and teach film audiences how to be good Americans  (Ewen and Ewen 1982). Whereas some films from the  silent and early sound era presented poverty and social  struggle from progressive perspectives sympathetic to  the poor and oppressed, many films focused on the  rich and celebrated wealth and power, serving as  advertisements for the consumer society and the ruling  élites. Cecil B. de Mille’s comedies and dramas of  modern marriage, for example, can be seen as marriage and fashionmmodels, and the romantic films of the  1920s can be read as ‘<span>manuals of desire, wishes,  dreams</span>’ for those wanting to assimilate themselves to  mainstream America (Ewen and Ewen 1982: 102). Consequently, films played an important socializing role by  mobilizing desires into certain models, In particular,  films helped socialize immigrant and working-class  cultures into the emerging forms of the consumer  society, teaching them how to behave properly and  consume with style and abandon.</p>
        <p>However, although films for the most part reflected  mainstream American values, they also represented  modern and urban social values, and as a result conservatives often attacked the alleged ‘<span>immorality</span>’ and  ‘<span>subversiveness</span>’ of Hollywood films (Jowett 1976).  Romantic dramas were attacked by the Legion of  Decency for promoting promiscuity, while crime dramas were frequently criticized for fostering juvenile  delinquency and crime. Due to pressure from civic  groups and the threat of government regulation, a  set of censorship boards was established with the co-operation of the film industry which produced a Production Code that was adopted by the film industry by  the mid-1930s. Explicit limits were set on the length of  allowable kisses and prescribed that no open-mouth  kisses could be shown. No nudity or explicit sexuality  was allowed, such things as prostitution and drugs  could not be portrayed, criminals had to be punished,  and religion and the church could not be criticized (the  code is reproduced and discussed in Jowett 197b). The  Production Code held away until the 1960s (although it  was challenged in the 1950s) and set firm ideological  and social parameters to Hollywood films.</p>
        <p>But the crucial determinants of the ideological functions of Hollywood film had to do with control of film  production by major studios and the production of  films primarily for profit. Since films had to attract large  audiences, they needed to resonate to audiences dreams, fears, and social concerns, and thus inevitably  reflected social mores, conflicts, and ideologies. Consequently, some of the first critical analyses of Hollywood film argued that films reflected American society,  providing mirror images of its dreams, fears, and mode  of life.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Film and society</h3>
        <p>The writings of Siegfried Kracauer provided one of the  first systematic studies of how films articulate social  content and was to influence the study of Hollywood.  His book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">From Caligari to Hitler</em> (1947) argues that  German inter-war films reveal a fear of emerging chaos  and disposition to submit to social authority. For  Kracauer, German films thus reflect and foster anti-democratic and passive attitudes of the sort that paved  the way for Nazism. While his assumption that ‘<span>inner</span>’  psychological tendencies and conflicts are projected  onto the screen opened up a fruitful area of socio-cultural analysis, he frequently ignored the role of  mechanisms of representation, such as displacement,  inversion, and condensation in the construction of cinematic images and narratives. He posits film society analogies (‘<span>Their silent resignation foreshadows the  passivity of many people under totalitarian rule</span>’  1 947: 218) that deny the autonomous and contradictory  character and effects of film discourse and the multiple  ways that audiences process cinematic material.</p>
        <p>Against this view, one could argue that the language  of film does not find its exact analogue in social events,  nor does film discourse exist as a parallel mirror to  actual events. Rather, films take the raw material of  social history and of social discourses and process  them into products which are themselves historical  events and social forces. Films, therefore, can provide  information about the ‘<span>psychology</span>’ of an era and its  tensions, conflicts, fears, and fantasies, but they do so  not as a simple representation or mirroring of an extra-cinematic social reality. Rather, films refract social discourses and content into specifically cinematic forms  which engage audiences in an active process of constructing meaning.</p>
        <p>Sociological and psychological studies of Hollywood film proliferated in the United States in the  post-Second World War era and developed a wide  range of critiques of myth, ideology, and meaning in  the American cinema. Parker Tyler’s studies <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hollywood Hallucination</em> (1944) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Myth and Magic of the Movies</em> (1947) applied Freudian and myth—symbol criticism to show how Walt Disney cartoons, romantic melodramas, and other popular films provided insights into  social psychology and context, while providing myths  suitable for contemporary audiences. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">In Movies: A Psychological Study</em> (1950), Martha Wolfenstein and  Nathan Leites applied psychoanalytical methods to  film, decoding fears, dreams, and aspirations beneath  the surface of 1940s Hollywood movies, arguing that  ‘<span>the common day dreams of a culture are in part the  sources, in part the products of its popular myths, stories, plays and films</span>’ (1950: 13). In her sociological study <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood: The Dream Factory</em> (1950), Hortense Powdermaker studied an industry that manufactured  dreams and fantasies, while Robert Warshow (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Immediate Experience</em>, 1970) related classical Hollywood genres like the western and the gangster film to  the social history and ideological concerns of US society.</p>
        <p>Films can provide information about the  ‘<span>psychology</span>’ of an era and its tensions,  conflicts, fears, and fantasies, but they  do so not as a simple representation or  mirroring of an extra-cinematic social  reality.quote</p>
        <p>Building on there traditions, Barbara Deming  demonstrated in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Running away from Myself</em> (1969)  how 1940s Hollywood films provided insights into  the social psychology and reality of the period. Deming ergued that. ‘<span>It is not as mirrors reflect us but,  rather, as our dreams do that movies most truly reveal  the times</span>’ (1969:1). She claimed that 1940s Hollywood  films provided a collective drearn portrait of its era and  proposed deciphering ‘<span>the dream that all of us have  been buying at the box office, to cut through to the real  nature of the identification we have experienced there</span>’  (1969: 5-6). Her work anticipates later, more sophisticated and university-based film criticism of the post-1960s era by showing how films both reproduce dominant ideologies and also contain proto-deconstructive  elements that cut across the grain of the ideology that  the films promote. She also undertook a sort of gender  reading of Hollywood film that would eventually  become a key part of Hollywood film criticism.</p>
        <p>Another tradition of film scholarship and criticism in  the United States attempted to situate films historically  and to describe the interactions between film and  society in more overtly political terms. This tradition  includes “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Lewis Jacob’s</span>” pioneering history of Hollywood film (1 939), “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">John Howard Lawson’s</span>” theoretical  and critical works (1953, 1964), “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Ian Jarvie’s</span>” sociological  inquiries into the relation between film and society  (1970, 1978), “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">David M. White</span>” and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Richard Averson’s</span>”  studies of the relation between film, history, and social  comment in film (1972), and the social histories written  by “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Robert Sklar</span>” (1975), “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Garth Jowett</span>” (1976), “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Will  Wright</span>” (1977), “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Peter Biskind</span>” (1983), and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Thomas  Schatz</span>” (1988), While this tradition has produced useful  insights into the relationships between Hollywood film  and US society in specific historical eras, it has also  tended to neglect the ways in which specific films or  genres work to construct meaning and the ways in  which audiences themselves interact with film.</p>
        <p>More theoretical approaches to Hollywood  emerged in the 1960s, including the ideological analyses of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinéma</em> and the extremely influential work associated with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Screen</em> which translated many  key <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> and other works of French film theory (see  Metz 1974; Heath 1981). The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> group moved  from seeing film as the product of creative auteurs, or  authors, to focus on the ideological and political content of film and how it transcoded dominant ideologies  (see Crofts on auteurisrn, Part 2, Chapter 7). At the  same tirne, French film theory and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Screen</em> focused on  the specific cinematic mechanisms which helped produce meaning.</p>
        <p>During this same period of ferment in film studies  during the 1960s and 1970s, the Birmingham Centre  for Contemporary Cultural Studies was discovering  that gender, race, and subculture were also an important element of analysing the relationships between  culture, ideology, and society. Encouraged by feminism to recognize the centrality of gender, it was argued  that the construction of dominant ideologies of masculinity and femininity were a central aspect of Hollywood  film (Kuhn 1982; Kaplan 1983). Studies of the ways in  which Hollywood films constructed race, ethnicity, and  sexuality also became a key aspect of film studies, and  various post-structuralist-influenced theories studied  the role of film and media culture in the social construction of ideologies and identities (see White, Smelik,  and Wiegman, Part 1, Chapters 13, 14, and 17).  As the theory wars of the past two decades have  proliferated, a tremendous range of new theories  have in turn been applied to film. Consequently, structuralism and post-structuralism, psychoanalysis,  deconstruction, feminism, postmodernism, and a  wealth of other theoretical approaches have generated an often bewildering diversity of approaches to  theorizing film which join and add complexity to previous critical stances such as genre theory, auteur theory, and historical—sociological approaches. My own  take on the cacophony of contemporary approaches  to film is that it is not a question of either/or and that a  variety of approaches can be deployed to engage the  relations of film to society. Consequently, in the following section I will discuss the genre approach to analysing the intersection of film and society, while in the  concluding section I will note the use of auteur criticism  and socio-ideological approaches to explain developments in contemporary Hollywood film. These  approaches can be combined, I would argue, with  the newer theoretical approaches to provide fuller  and richer thematizations of the relations of Hollywood  film to US society. Thus, analysing the connections  between film and society requires a multidimensional  film criticism that situates its object within the context  of the social milieu within which it is produced and  received (Kellner 1995).</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood genres</h3>
        <p>Although much of the best European art film can be  interpreted as a result of the creative vision and talent  of individual directors, Hollywood film from the beginning was deeply influenced by the dominant genres in  its studio system. The Hollywood mode of cinematic  production formed an integrated system whose major  studios not only controlled film production, but also  distribution. This ensured a guaranteed exhibition site  for Hollywood product. The system first emerged in  the teens, took its distinctive shape in the 1920s,  reached maturity in the 1940s, and began to disintegrate in the 1950s owing to antitrust legislation which  caused the studios to divest themselves of their distribution and exhibition channels, and also to competition from other media of entertainment such as  television (see Balio 1976; Schatz 1981, 1988; Gomery,  Part 2, Chapter 3).</p>
        <p>Since the main Hollywood studios repeatedly reproduced the types of film that they thought were the most  popular, Hollywood cinema became primarily a genre  cinema in which popular formulas are repeated in  cycles of genres that in turn deal with central societal  conflicts, problems, and concerns of its audiences (see  Ryall, Part 2, Chapter 8). The western, for example  deals with conflicts between civilization and threats  to civilization, whereas the gangster film deals with  threats to law, order, and social stability within an  already established urban society. Melodramas, social  comedies, and musicals deal with conflicts and problems within domestic arenas like the family and  romance, whereas war films and adventure genres  generaliy deal with conflicts in the public sphere outside the private realm.</p>
        <p>In order to resonate to audience fears, fantasies, and  experiences, the Hollywood genres had to deal with  the central conflicts and problems in US society and  had to offer soothing resolutions, assuring its audiences that all problems could be solved within existing  institutions. Western films, for example, assured their  audiences that ‘<span>civilization</span>’ could be maintained in the  face of threats from criminals, outsiders, and villains of  various sorts, and celebrated individualism, white male  authority figures, and violence as a legitimate way of  resolving conflicts. In the westerns mythologized version of American history, it was glossed over that the  ‘<span>villains</span>’ in many westerns were the land’s original inhabitants who had their property stolen by the white  settlers, presented as being forces of civilization. This  in turn generated ideologies of racism and imperialism  whereby the ‘<span>enemies</span>’ of civilization (Indians, Mexicans, villains) were portrayed negatively, thus legitimizing the ‘<span>settlement</span>’ of the west by (white-mate-dominated) forces of ‘<span>civilization</span>’. In addition, women  were stereotyped as either whores or submissive  representatives of the domestic order, thus reproducing patriarchical ideologies.</p>
        <p>Gangster films appealed to people’s fear of crime and  fascination with criminals; the ciassical Hollywood gangster films inculcated the message that ‘<span>crime does not  pay</span>’ and showed the police and legal system able to  contain crime and to deal with criminals. But gangster  films also explored cultural conflicts and contradictions  central to American capitalism. Gangsters are, in fact,  prototypical capitalists who will do anything to make a  buck and thus are allegorical stand-ins for capitalist  energy and will. Gangster films explore the tensions  within American life between making money and morality, between self-interest and legality, and between  private and public interests. The gangsters are fantasy  characters who act out secret audience desires to get  ahead no matter what, although it is still not clear if their repeated punishment (mandated by the Production  Code) actually helped prevent crime through dramatizing what would happen if one broke the rules of the  game and stepped outside the law, or promoted crime  through making the gangsters—often played by popular figures like James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart—extremely dynamic, attractive, and vital figures.</p>
        <p>Picture: A celebration of maternal sacrifice? Barbara Stanwyck, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stella Dallas</em> (1937) quote</p>
        <p>Melodramas, social comedies, and musicals in turn  legitimized male-dominated romance, marriage,  family, and moral rectitude as the proper road to happiness and well-being. Musicals followed formulas of  boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl to  celebrate the desirability of male-dominated romance.  Melodramas dramatized what would happen to way-ward women or wilful men who failed to conform to  dominant gender roles. They celebrated hard-working  mothers who sacrificed their own happiness for their  children. thus projecting the proper role for women (as,  for example, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Imitation of Life</em> (1934/1959), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stella Dallas</em> (1 937), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildred Pierce</em> (1 945), and others), and  intimated that life’s greatest happiness derived from  marriage and family, And social comedies, too, celebrated marriage and family as the proper goals for men  and women (Cavell 1982). Indeed, David Bordwell  claims that in his random selection of 100 typical Hollywood movies, 95 made romance at least one important  line of action while, in 85, heterosexual romantic love  was the major focus (Bordwell <em class="notranslate" translate="no">et al</em>. 1985: 16).</p>
        <p>Hollywood genre films thus tended to promote the  American dream and dominant American myths and  ideologies. The Hollywood genres taught that money  and success were important values; that heterosexual romance, marriage, and family were the proper social  forms; that the state, police, and legal system were  legitimate sources of power and authority; that violence was justified to destroy any threats to the system;  and that American values and institutions were basically sound, benevolent, and beneficial to society as a  whole. In this way, Hollywood film, supported by other  forms of media culture, helped establish a certain  hegemony or cultural dominance of existing institutions and values to the exclusion of others. As Raymond Williams has argued,</p>
        <p>in any society, in any particular period, there is a central  system of practices, meanings and values, which we can  properly call dominant and effective ... what I have in  mind is the central, effective and dominant system of meanings and values, which are not merely abstract but which are  organized and lived. That is why hegemony is not to be  understood at the level of mere opinion or mere manipulation. It is a whole body of practices and expectations; our  assignments of energy, our ordinary understanding of the  nature of man and of his world. It is a set of meanings and  values which as they are experienced as practices appear as  reciprocally confirming. (Williams 1983: 8—9)quote</p>
        <p>Hollywood film is thus implicitly ‘<span>political</span>’ in the way it  tends to support dominant American values and institutions. The more explicitly political functions of Hollywood cinema generally emerge in times of social crisis.</p>
        <p>During both world wars war films and other genres  advocated patriotism and presented the ‘<span>enemy</span>’ in  stereotypical terms. During the Cold War periode Hollywood produced a genre cycle of anti-communist films  that depicted the threat to democracy and the ‘<span>American way of life</span>’ by the ‘<span>communist conspiracy</span>’  Whereas during the Second World War Russians  were presented positively as US allies against fascism,  from the late 1940s on through <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rambo</em> (1985) communists are generally presented as the incarnation of evil.</p>
        <p>Genre films could be used to contest  ideological norms as well as reproduce  them, and to provide ideology critique  as well as legitimization.</p>
        <p>Yet the Hollywood system was flexible enough  allow individual cinematic statements and social critique within the genre system. Hollywood films prized  difference and variation within accepted boundaries and left a limited range open for artistic expression and  social commentary. As a result, it is not certain that the  genre films always resolved the social contradictions  portrayed or successfully served as ideological advertisements for existing social institutions, discourses,  and practices. As previcusly noted, the crime dramas  often made the criminal’s transgressions of societal  norms more appealing and attractive than their punishment, and likewise women’s transgressions of bourgeois norms in the melodrama often put in question  established patriarchal institutions. The western could  also be used to portray the victims of the conquest of  the frontier sympathetically and could be used to  attack the crimes and barbarism of the ‘<span>civilizing</span>’  forces. Genre films could thus be used to contest ideological norms well as reproduce them, and to provide ideology critique as well as legitimization.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood today and into the future</h3>
        <p>During the 1950s the studio systern, which had produced genre cycles as the mode of production of Hollywood film, began to break up, and the genre system  was challenged, opening the way to new types of film.  The result was a very fertile period of production in the  1950s, with film becoming more varied, diverse, and  socially critical than in previous eras. The rise of new  directors like Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Penn, and Robert  Altman who had distinctive artistic visions and styles  seemed to give credence to the notion of a ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Hollywood</span>’ and provided a boost to auteur criticism that  focused on the cinematic style and form of key directors and films (see Kramer, Part 2, Chapter 6). However,  a focus simply on the new freedoms granted to  ‘<span>auteurs</span>’ is too on-sided; one also needs insight into  the complex interaction of film, the production system,  and more general social discourses and social struggles (Kellner and Ryan 1988).</p>
        <p>It was widely perceived in the 1960s, for example,  that youth constituted a major audience for Hollywood  film and so more films and directors  emerged, creating new cycles of films which cinematically inscribed the discourses of the New Left student  movements, as well as the feminist, black-power, sexual liberationist, and counter-cultural movements. producing a new type of socially critical Hollywood film.  These films transcoded (i.e. translated) representations, discourses, and myths of 1960s culture into specifically cinematic terms, as when <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Easy Rider</em> (1969) transcodes the images, practices, and discourses of  the 1960s counter-culture into a cinematic text. Popular  films intervened in the political struggles of the day, as  when 1960s films advanced the agenda of the New  left and the counter-culture. Films of the ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Hollywood</span>’ (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bonnie and Clyde</em>, 1967, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Medium Cool</em>,  1969, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Easy Rider</em>, 1969), however, were contested  by a resurgence of right-wing films during the same era  (e.g. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dirty Harry</em> 1971, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The French Connection</em>, 1971,  and John Wayne films), leading many to conclude that  Hollywood film, like US society, should be seen as a  contested terrain and that films could be interpreted as  a struggle of representation over how to construct a  social world and everyday life.</p>
        <p>In 1970s films, intense battles between liberals and  conservatives were evident throughout the decade in  Hollywood film, with mere radical voices—of the sort  that occasionally were heard in the late 1960s and early  1970s—becoming increasingly marginalized. As the  1970s progressed, conservative films became more  popular (e.g. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rocky</em>, 1976, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Star Wars</em>, 1977, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>, 1977, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Superman</em>, 1978,  and so on), indicating that conservative sentiments  were growing in the public and that Hollywood was  nurturing these political currents. This was linked to the  growth of the ‘<span><em class="notranslate" translate="no">blockbuster</em></span>’ syndrome begun by Jaws in  1975. Henceforth, ‘<span>high-concept</span>’ films that could be  clearly described and marketed became a major focus  of the Hollywood flim industry, which sought <em class="notranslate" translate="no">blockbuster</em> hits that would turn over a high profit (Wyatt 1994).</p>
        <p>Hollywood film, like US society, should  be seen as a contested terrain and films  could be interpreted as a struggle of  representation over how to construct a  social world and everyday life.</p>
        <p>Indeed, during the 1970s even liberal films ultimately helped advance the conservative cause. A cycle  of liberal political conspiracy films (e.g. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Parallax View</em>, 1974, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All the President’s Men</em>, 1976, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Domino Principle</em>, 1977, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Winter Kills</em>, 1979, and so on) vilified  the state and thus played into the hands of the conservative Reaganite argument that government was  the source of much existing evil. And even the most  socially critical films (such as the Jane Fonda films,  Network, 1976, and other Sidney Lunnet films) posited  individual solutions to social problems, thus reinforcing the conservative appeal to individualism and the  attack on statism. Consequently, reading Hollywood  films of the decade politically allowed one to anticipate  the coming of Reagan and the New Right. to power by  demonstrating that conservative yearnings were ever  more popular within the culture and that film and popular culture were helping to form an ideological matrix  more hospitable to Reagan and conservatives than to  embattled liberals (Kellner and Ryan 1988).== However, it is also worth noting that even seemingly  conservative film genres such as the horror film, or  seemingly anti-gay films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cruising</em> (1980), could  contain critical moments, problematicizing hegemonic  ideologies and putting in question dominant ideologies like the family (Wood 1986). Robin Wood argues  that the ‘<span>incoherent text</span>’ is a dominant cinematic mode  of the 1970s, full of ideological contradictions and  conflict that reproduce existing social confusion and  turmoil. Thus, film, like society, was very much a contested terrain, with the future of society and culture up  for grabs.</p>
        <p>With the election of Reagan in 1980, the conservative wave of films continued throughout the decade,  with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">blockbuster</em> syndrome remaining the pre-dominant trend. Gender struggles were particularly  intense with a return to the ‘<span>hard-body</span>’ masculine  hero of an earlier era, replacing the more feminized  male heroes of the late 19605 and early l970s (Jeffords  1994). As part of the backlash against feminism, there  was also a cycle of films that villainized independent  women, showing single career women without families  being driven into pathological behaviour. (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fatal Attraction</em>, 1987, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Basic Instinct</em>, 1992, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hand that Rocks the Cradle</em>, 1992, and so on). On the other hand, conservative ideologies were contested by liberal and radical  films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Missing</em> (1982), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reds</em> (1981), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Salvador</em> (1986), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Platoon</em> (1986), and other Oliver Stone films, as well as a  wealth of films by independent filmmakers like John  Sayles and Spike Lee. A cycle of gay and lesbian films  expanded the representations of sexuality, and many  films began to provide more complex, varied, and  progressive representations of gender and ethnicity.</p>
        <p>At the same time, a proliferation of new critical strategies emerged, including the multicultural approach  of cultural studies. There was an especially intense  focus on audience research, on how audiences produced meanings, on how films-mobilized pleasure and  influenced audiences, and on how audiences decoded  and used the materials of media culture. Consequently, a wide range of positions appeared on the  relationship between film, media culture, and its audiences (see the discussion in Staiger, 1991).</p>
        <p>During the past decade globalization has made  Hollywood film an ever more familiar and popular artefact throughout the world. Whereas Hollywood films  have dominated the world market for decadec, it is  even more the case today with American global corpotations playing an important role in distributing its  products throughout the world. To some extent globalization equals Americanization, and Hollywood film is  an effective arm of media culture to sell the ‘<span>American way of life</span>’ (see Cvetovich and Kellner 1997). However,  the relationships Hollywood film, US society,  and the entire world are complex and require a multiperspectival approach that dissects the political economy of the film industry and the production of film;  provides critical and analytical readings of cinematic  texts; and studies how audiences appropriate and use  film and other cultural artefacts (see Miller, Part 2,  Chapter 12).</p>
        <p>Finally, we are currently undergoing one of the most  dramatic technological revolutions of all time with new  entertainment and information technologies emerging, accompanied by unprecedented mergers of  the entertainment and information industries (Wasko  1994). These new syntheses are producing novel forms  of visual and multi-media culture in which it is anticipated that film will appear in seductive new virtual and  interactive forms, accessible through computer, satellite, and other new technologies. There is feverish  speculation that the Internet and its assorted technologies will create a new entertainment and information  environment, and currently the major corporatiors and  players are envisaging what sort of product and delivery system will be most viable and profitable for films  and other entertainment of the future. Thus, one imagines that the relationships between film and society  will continue to be highly significant as we approach a  new century and perhaps a new era that will supply  novel forms of film and new perspectives on the film  culture of the past.</p>

        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood and Ideology</h3>
        <p>Robert B. Ray from Robert B. Ray, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Certain Tendency of the Hollywood Cinema</em>, 1930-1980 Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985).</p>
        <p>My work initially proceeded from a naive reflection theory  that sought to explain the evolution of the popular American  cinema in terms of the movies response to changing  historical conditions. Eventually I realized that the movies not  only reflected but also excluded the world, and that I needed  an approach that would account for both a reflection more  complicated than I had originally granted and an exclusion  more systematic than I had reckoned on. In short, I needed  theories of over determination and transformation. I found  them in three schools of thought that have converged in  recent film scholarship: Marxism (especially Althusser’s  discussions of ideology); myth study (especially Lévi-Strauss’s  notion that myths are transformntions of basic dilemmas or  contradictions that In reality cannot be solved); and  psychoanalysis (especially Freud’s dream work and its notions  of condensation and displacement).</p>
        <p>Each of these schools entails a particular assumption about  film. For Marxism, movies are ideological formations,  screened and shaped by political censorship. For myth study,  movies are myths whose individual shapes arise from the  ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">rules of transformation</span>’. For psychoanalysis, movies are  dreams, screened and reshaped by a culture’s collective  psychic censorship.</p>
        <p>The merger cf these three methodolocies (especially in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Screen</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinéma</em>) derives from their two  basic similarities: all three are theories of both  overdeterminism and transformation. Althusserian Marxism  proposes that any phenomenon at any level of society results  from multiple determinations (economic, cultural, political,  personal, traditional, aesthetic). Lévi-Strauss suggests that  each version of a myth results from those multiple  deterrninations that have shaped the rules of transformation—that flexibility which enables a single  cultural anxiety to assume different shapes in response to an  audience’s changing needs. Freud refers; to dream images as  condensations and displacements resulting from multiple  dream thoughts.</p>
        <p>All three methodologies attempt to define the rules of  transformation or censorship, the system that enables a  message to cross a boundary and enter another domain.  Thus, analysis in all three cases becomes an attempt to trace  the path of that message back to its previous site. Marxism  wants to discover the ‘<span>cause</span>’ of a culture’s particular way of  representing material conditions (i.e. its the  case of Hollywood movies, for example, the material origins  of melodrama. Lévi-Strauss asks why a body of myths has  appeal for a given culture: what dilemma does it atternpt to  solve? Freud wants to locete the repressed anxiety or wigh  behind the overdetermined dream images. Thus, according  to these theories, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> (1 942), for example, becomes,  as ideology, a representation of an unsolvable dilemma—the  conflicting appeals of intervention and isolationism; as myth,  an attempt to resolve that dilemma; as dream, a displaced  condensation of the anxiety generated by that contradiction.</p>
        <p>Since the beginning, however, film theory’s particular  preference for the psychoanalytic accounting (the movie-as-dream) has resulted in an impasse. Certainly, Freud’s  condonsation and displacement (and his insistence on the  dream’s need for concrete representation) offered rules by  which latent dream thoughts (wishes, anxieties) get  transformed into dream images. But the associative chains  by which Freud retraced these images to their unconscious  sources were utterly private, available only to the particular  dreamer (and, after enormous effort, to Freud himself).  Dream images, in other words, are at best <em class="notranslate" translate="no">subjective</em> correlatives whose import typically remains hidden from  even the dreamer.</p>
        <p>To the extent that movies work like dreams, Hollywood’s  challenge lay in developing rules of condensation and  displacement that would work for the audience as a whole,  or, to out it another way, that would provide immediately  (albeit unconsciously) recognizable objective (?) correlatives  for the common wishes and fears of the mass audience.  Hollywood’s enormous commercial success proves that it  met this challenge. It did so by becoming intuitively Lévi-Straussian: the American film industry discovered and used  the existing body of mythic oppositions provided it by the  local culture. In effect, the great Hollywood tsars become  naive, prodigious anthropologists.</p>
        <p>The determinedly commercial nature of the American movie  business, however, and its financial servitude to the  politically powerful eastern banks, insured that Hollywood’s  elaborations of American mythology would not proceed  according to tho mathematically indifferent rules of  transformation posited by Lévi-Strauss, but rather according  to tho ideologically censoring standards posited by Marx in a  famous passage:</p>
        <p>The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas,  i.e. the class which is the ruling <em class="notranslate" translate="no">material</em> force of society, is at the  same time its ruling <em class="notranslate" translate="no">intellectual</em> force. The class which hag the  means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby,  generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of  mental production are subject to it.</p>
        <p>Thus, each variation of what I will call the thematic paradigm  (in western, musicals, gangster movies, etc.) could pose  issues only in terms allowed by the prevailing ideology—or  could refusé. to acknowledge that ideological disposition  only at its own commercial risk. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em>, as I will argue,  could deal with the intervention—isolationism opposition only  by displacing it into the ideologically favoured realm of  melodrama, where (since such displacements were  traditional to American culture) ample mythic types, images,  and stories were available.--- Have dissident variations (thematic or stylistic) any chance of  disrupting or subverting a movie’s intended ideological  effect? This question seems to me the most interesting thing  we can ask about the American cinema. Unfortunately, we  still have to ask it on a case-by-case basis. I have not been  able to develop a general theory thas would account in the  abstract for dissident thematic variation’s ability to outfight  the context that seeks to subdue it. I do not want to fall back  on a lame imitation of Potter Stewart’s famous ‘<span>I-know-it-when-I-see-it</span>’ definition of obscenity, but for the present, I  can only suggest tho value of a thesis proposed by Charles  Eckert in an article that deserves to be far more famous than  it is: writing about <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marked Woman</em> (1937), Eckert argues that  truly effective challenges to Hollywood’s prevailing ideology  surface in those moments within a movie when the emotional  quotient is simply excessive in terms of the narrative’s  nee Is—emotion, in other words, that remains inadequately  motivated.</p>
        <p>Significantly, some of the most abidingly interenting  American movies display precisely these moments of excess.  These same films have proved among the most popular ever  made in this country, a fact suggesting that the mass  audience in this country likes to live dangerously, likes to see  the most privileged elements of its ideology sorely  challenged, if not defeated.</p>
