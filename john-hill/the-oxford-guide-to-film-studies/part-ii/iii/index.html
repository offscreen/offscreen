        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood as Industry</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Douglas Gomery</h3>
        <p>While the study of film may involve a concern aesthetics, technology, ideology, and audience, it is the study of film as an industry which remains central and is basic to all other <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>studies. For in most of the world <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>is first of all organized as an industry, that is as a collection of businesses seeking profits through film production, film distribution, and the presentation of movies to audiences (whether in theatres, on television, through video, or by some new method). So, although we may wish that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>was not a business, we none the less need to study the industrial character of film in order to understand fully the impact and influence of motion pictures.</p>
        <p>A central question which most scholars characteristically face is: how does the study of the organization and control of the film industry help to explain the aesthetics, ideology, and reception of film? There is no simple answer to this, but I side with the argument that, while the film industry does not straightforwardly determine the aesthetic and ideological characteristics of film, it none the less sets the constraints within which aesthetics, ideology, and reception must operate. However, the theory linking the study of film as an industry to concerns of aesthetics, ideology, and reception remains to be worked out and will constitute one of the central tasks for film historians.</p>
        <p>The study of the film industry itself is complex, but it is simplified by one key historical fact. Since the 1920s that is, for most of the history of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>one industry, that based in the United States and known as Hollywood, has dominated the world. Thus the locus of study for the history of the film industry properly begins with Hollywood, not because the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>industry based in the United States has produced the best films (by some criteria) but because it has forced all other national cinemas to begin by dealing with the power of Hollywood as an industry.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">First principles</h3>
        <p>Hollywood is first of all an industry, a collection of profit maximizing corporations operated from studio head-quarters in the United States, and so, like all film industries, it consists of three fundamental components: production, distribution, and presentation of feature films.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Production</em>. Films must be created s Since the early 1910s this has been done in studios in and around Los Angeles in an area generically known as Hollywood. However, it encompasses more than that city section: the Universal Studios, for example, are in Universal City, Warner Bros. in Burbank.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Distribution</em>. Once films are made, Hollywood companies then peddle their films around the world. World-wide distribution has long been the basis of Hollywood’s power and no other film industry has been as far-reaching for as long as Hollywood.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Presentation</em>. Finally, movies are watched in theatres and cinemas, and on television at home. Prior to the television age, films were shown principally in theatres which were sometimes vast 6,000-seat movie palaces. Since the 1960s most people see most movies at home on television.</p>
        <p>The key question then is: how did a collection of major studio corporations (Hollywood) come to dominate the production, distribution, and exhibition of movies and continue to maintain its control through the coming of sound, the innovation of colour and widescreen images, and the diffusion of and home video? I shall explore the answers to this question by examining the history of Hollywood as an industry, identifying four key periods. the rise of Hollywood, from the late nineteenth century to the coming of sound;</p>
        <p>• the studio era of the 1930s and 1940s;</p>
        <p>• the television broadcasting age beginning with the rise of television in the 1950s;</p>
        <p>• and the era inaugurated by the coming of the feature film blockbuster in the mid-1970s.</p>
        <blockquote>The key question then is: how did a collection of major studio corporations (Hollywood) come to dominate the production, distribution. and exhibition of movies and continue to maintain its through the coming of sound, the innovation of colour and widescreen images, and the diffusion of television and home video?</blockquote>
        <h3>The rise of Hollywood</h3>
        <p>The motion picture industry in the United States grew from its origins during the final years of the nineteenth century to consolidation into an oligopoly (that is, control by a few corporations) in 1930, amidst the coming of sound. This initial period of Hollywood history is tainted by an overlay of sadness in that Hollywood has been seen as preventing what might have been—a group of progressive filmmakers serving a working-class audience—adopting instead an overt profit-maximizing structure Wasko 1982; Guback 1969). Nevertheless, we need to continue to look at how the remarkable institution of Hollywood came to be.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>was just another technology. Through the decade of the 1890s into the early days of the twentieth century inventors worked with the first filmmakers and exhibitors to persuade a sceptical public to embrace the movie show. The study of the introduction of this new technology focuses on a set of businesses formed to exploit the new knowledge in the United States and around the world.</p>
        <p>The early inventors and entrepreneurs were not operating in a vacuum, seeking to create some ideal new enterprise, but rather sought to sell their discoveries through the existing entertainment industries. Robert Allen (1985) shows that the vaudeville (or variety) hall provided the first business outlet. However, as Allen (1982’) demonstrates for Manhattan, and I have shown for other cities in the United States (Gomery, 1992), this model of exhibition soon gave way to the nickelodeons—the thousands of converted store-front theatres—that from 1905 to 1910 presented hour-long all-movie shows; and it was the nickelodeon that formed the basis of the film industry that within a decade became Hollywood.</p>
        <p>However, more than a locus for presenting was needed; a system of producing films also had to develop, and Hollywood established a flexible system for regularly producing and distributing feature-length motion pictures, along with short subjects and newsreels (Staiger 1982). It is this process of learning to make movies that would seil on a year-round basis that constitutes part of the analysis of David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson in their highly influential book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Classical Hollywood Cinema</em> (1985).</p>
        <p>Finally, Hollywood came to stand for world distribution and presentation. The diffusion of the Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>throughout the world was successfully comepleted by the early 1920s, but the achievement of world hegemony was not straightforward. Robert Anderson (1985) shows that a monopoly based on patents was formed by Thomas Edison and others, but then quickly tailed, and it was to take flexibility of a different kind to gain long-term control.</p>
        <p>This initial period ended with a sudden technical change—the coming of sound. The popularity of the talkies enabled new companies such as Warner Bros, to rise to power and join the small list of major studios including Paramount, Loew’s, and other powerful corporations of the silent era, which not only retained but increased their power (Gomery 1980, 1982a).</p>
        <h3>The studio system</h3>
        <p>The coming of sound consolidated Hollywood’s control over the world market and moved the United States into the studio era in which filmmaking, distribution, and exhibition were dominated by five theatre corporations: Paramount, Loew’s (parent company to the more famous MGM), Fox Film (later Twentieth Century-Fox), Warner Bros., and RKO. They ruled Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s and operated around the world as fully integrated business enterprises.</p>
        <p>Historians have struggled to deal with the studio system. We have a number of ‘insider’ studio histories best exemplified by Bosley Crowther’s (1957) authorized history of Loew’s Inc. and MGM. Although this is rich in data, it is almost wholly lacking in perspective and method; Lillian Ross’s (1952) history of the same studio is far more critical. In recent years a few histories of individual studios and powerful producers have appeared, such as Tino Balio’s (1976) history of United Artists and Mathew Bernstein’s (1994) study of Walter Wanger. But fine as these two studies are, United Artists and Walter Wanger hardly stood at the centre of the Hollywood industry. In-depth studies of the operations of key studios such as Twentieth Century-Fox and Paramount remain to be done. Gomery (1986) is a general study covering the studio system as a whole, including its major participants. Some of the detail it omits is provided by Kathy Klaprat’s (1985) analysis of a single star, Bette Davis, and how she struggled to work within the studio system, and by Ida Jeter’s (1986) examination of the attempts to unionize workers with less fame and fortune. More basic building-block studies such as these two are needed.</p>
        <p>However, it was theatre ownership rather than studio production which defined the status of Hollywood in this era. By controlling picture palaces in all of the downtown areas across the United States, the major studios took three-quarters of the average box-office receipts. Only after their own theatres had soaked up as much as possible of the initial wave of box-office grosses through first and exclusive runs did the ‘Big Five’ permit smaller, independent theatres to scramble for the remaining bookings, sometimes months, or even years, after a film’s premiere.</p>
        <p>Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists constituted the studio era’s ‘Little Three’ and led the scramble for these left-over film revenues. While always considered part of the Hollywood studio colossus, these three corporations could never match the economic muscle of the Big Five because they did not own the top (exclusively first-run) theatres. Even less powerful were Monogram and Republic Pictures, the inhabitants of ‘Poverty Row’, which created low-budget fare for marginal theatres. This type of production was partly fuelled by changes in exhibition practice brought on by the Great Depression. Borrowing thechniques from the dime stores, marginal neighbourhood movie houses began regularly to offer two films for the price of one—the double feature—and thus stimulated the demand for the B movie.</p>
        <h3>The television broadcasting age</h3>
        <p>The decline of the studio era was the result of three main factors: the Paramount antitrust decrees, the social transformation of the United States with sub-urbanization and the baby boom, and the emergence of a moving-image rival, television. In 1948, as a consequence of what became known as the Paramount case, the federal government of United States forced the Big Five to sell their movie palaces, and suddenly Hollywood lost direct control of and access to the movie market. This legal antitrust case against the Big Five and the Little Three had its origins in the second administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1936—40) which, as Conant (1960, 1985) has shown, turned to enforcement of existing antitrust laws to help bring the nation out of the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>This action against the major studios also occurred at a time when <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>audiences were falling. Weekly attendance in movie theatres in the United States peaked in 1946 and then began to drop, so that by the early 1960s it was half of what it had been in the glory days of the Second World War. The causes of this decline have been much debated and television is conventionally identified as the central villain. The common argument is this: once television programming commenced in the United States after the Second World War, movie fans stayed at home, attracted by ‘free’ (i.e. funded by advertising) television entertainment. Going out to the movies suddenly became a relatively expensive night out, requiring a long journey downtown. Television entertainment was so much cheaper that millions of citizens of the United States simply stayed at home.</p>
        <h3>Pictures</h3>
        <p>Struggle within the studio system—Marllyn Monroe and Louis Calhern rehearse <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Aspalt Jungle</em> (1950)</p>
        <p>However, this ‘analysis of substitution’ ignores that, in most parts of the United States, television signals did not become available until long after the decline in moviegoing had commenced (see Gomery 1992). During the late 1940s and early 1950s only one-third of the nation had sets, but it was precisely then that millions stopped going to the movies. After the Second World War, formerly loyal film fans in the United States began to look for other things to do: starting families, finding nicer homes in the suburbs, buying cars, refrigerators, or the elusive pair of nylons not available during the war. It was therefore suburbanization and the baby boom (and the costs to a family involved) that were probably most responsible for the initial decline in movie attendance in the United States.</p>
        <p>During the 1950s and 1960s the film industry adjusted to these new circumstances, first with auto theatres (drive-ins) and then with cinemas in shoppingmalls, the long-term solution. In this completely new network of venues Hollywood also differentiated its product from black-and-white television with the development of widescreen and colour images. These and the introduction of Panavision lenses and Eastman Color film stock ought to be judged as important in their day as the coming of sound had been a generation earlier.</p>
        <p>The arrival of television transformed Hollywood in expected and unexpected ways. Ever since the 1950s, when citizens of the United States stuffed their homes with television sets, Hollywood has been predicted to lose its power. This, however, has not been the case as the industry has adapted to, and taken advantage of, its changed circumstances. There are too few studies of this era of chance. Concerning the corporate level there is Tino Balio’s (1987) history of United Artists in the television age, from 1952 to the late 1970s. This company, Balio argues, demonstrated the importance of independent production for future Hollywood filmmaking; but unlike its rivals of the 1950s, the pioneering United Artists did not benefit from its innovations and by the 1980s had been reduced to a minor player in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Balio and others argue that these moves towards independent filmmaking represented a new mode of Hollywood production. Gone were the studios as factories turnino out regular product for their theatre chains. Instead, independent producers put together packages of stars, a story, and production values which they turned into feature films that were distributed by a studio. In this formulation, the studio boss is seen to lose his former power, while that-of the director as auteur is seen to increase.</p>
        <p>This, however, was not the case. Independent production simply provided the studios with a more flexible, less costly way to fill their quotas of releases. No production was made without the green. light from a studio head, whether the director was an auteur or a hired hand from a talent agency. Packagers came and went, but the studios remained all-powerful. Without studio approval, no blockbuster was made.</p>
        <p>And while Hollywood may have used the blockbuster to distinguish the cinematic experience from that of television, the film industry also made its peace with broadcast television. This began with the movie made for television and then expanded into the mini-series and novel adapted for television. While these low-budget made-for-television dramas have often been attacked by critics, they are really the successors to Hollywood’s B movies of yesteryear and have helped to boost ratings—which is why mini-series such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood Wives</em> (1985) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Thorn Birds</em> (1983) have arrived like clockwork at key ratings-measurement periods.</p>
        <h3>Today and into the future</h3>
        <p>By the mid-1970s Hollywood as an industry had adjusted to a new world of flexible film production and the new suburban audiences captured by television. However, as the work of Mayer (1978), Gomery (1993), and Vogel (1995) suggests, a new era for Hollywood as a film industry began in the mid-1970s following the innovation of the blockbuster, exemplified by such films as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jaws</em> (1 97 5) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Star Wars</em> (1977). Despite the heralded ‘end’ of moviegoing, theatrical attendance in the United States has remained steady at 1 billion admissions per year. Millions of fans still journey in the summer high season to nearby multiplex cinemas in the shopping-mall to relish Hollywood blockbusters. Indeed Hollywood corporate stock market prices rise and fall with the weekend figures for such films.</p>
        <p>Hollywood an industry has also continued to redefine itself, principally by adding to its technological bag of tricks. Computers in particular have enabled filmmakers to craft special effects to live action and animation in a way which was simply not possible before, and major hits such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</em> (1988) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jurassic Park</em> (1993) have achieved near-miraculous interaction of live and animated figures. Yet, despite these technological innovations, the process of moviemaking has stayed remarkably constant because the underlying ideology of narrative production has remained unchanged.</p>
        <p>This position differs from that of Janet Staiger, who has argued for various periods of production in Holly- wood end their key differences (Staiger 1982). Staiger’s meticulous work identifies a rnutation from independent production to a package system. Yet, looking over the history of production in Hollywood, I find a consistent pattern—with studios always selecting films for production and groups under studio control making them—rather than some fundamental set of transformations. My view, however, is a minority one, and the debate about understanding the history of modes of production in Hollywood is destined to continue.</p>
        <p>For me, it is the new ways and places to watch movies—especially cable, satellite, and video—that have defined the era of contemporary cinema. In the mid-1970s Time Inc. changed the world of cable television in the United States for ever with its Home Box Office (HBO), which, for a monthly fee of about $ 10, offered cable television subscribers recent Hollywood motion pictures—uncut, uninterrupted by commercialsand not sanitized to please network censors. For the first time in the television age a way had been found to make viewers pay for what they watched in their living-rooms. As ‘pay television’, HBO also lured back the older movie fan who did not want to go out to a theatre but loved watching second-run films on tele- vision at home.</p>
        <p>But cable television offers the film fan much morethan HBO. The entrepreneur Ted Turner took a typical independent television station, complete with its sports, reruns, and old movies, and beamed it to all America via the satellite to create his famous Superstation with half of the schedule filled with old films. By 1995 there were also American Movie Classics and a number of other repertory cable television cinemas in the home, where old Hollywood films, the best and worst, run all day long.</p>
        <p>The post-1975 video age achieved its greatest change in the mid-1980s with the home video revolution. Sony introduced its Betamax half-inch home-video cassette recorder in 1975. Originally priced at more tha $1,000, the cost of the Beta machines and their newer rivals from VHS dropped to just over $300 by the mid-1980s. An enthusiastic American public (plus millions in other nations) snapped up so many machines that by 1989 fully two-thirds of American households were equipped to tape off the air or run pre-recorded tapes.  At first the Hollywood moguls loathed the new machine. Jack Valenti, President of the Motion Picture Association of America, declared that the VCR was a parasitical instrument robbing Hollywood’s take at the box-office. But quickly enough, during the 1980s, Hollywood found a way to capitalize on the innovation. In 1986 the returns from ancillary video sidelines exceeded the take at the box-office in the United States. During the mid-1980s about 400 new pre-recorded cassettes were being released each month, 70 per cent of which were Hollywood feature films. In the 1990s came ‘sell through’, by which Hollywood studios, led by Disney with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aladdin</em> (1992) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Lion King</em> (1994), sold tapes at prices between $10 and $20 directly to the public, bypassing rental altogether. As Hollywood moved towards the end of the twentieth century, it had fully absorbed the impact of the VCR and had begun to look forward to the next technological change.</p>
        <p>This adaptation to the new delivery systems has been accompanied by a change of ownership of the major Hollywood corporations and their emergence as media conglomerates. This process of conglomeratization may be seen to have begun during the television age, as the example of the rise of the Disney operation shows (Gomery 1994). As the age of television began after the Second World War, Disney was a minor player in corporate Hollywood, and indeed nearly went out of business during the early 1950s. But the studio entered television production early on, pioneered theme parks, and later skilfully exploited cable television, home video, and merchandising. Disney became a major Hollywood operation and then a major producer of feature films. Since the rnid-1980s this process of conglomeratization has intensified. The owners and operators of the Hollywood of the television era, led by Lew Wasserman at Universal, cashed in, while outsiders—recognizing the advent of 6 new industrial era characterized by video, multiplying cable television channels, and movies on demand—bought in.</p>
        <p>This process began in 1985—6, when Rupert Murdoch took over Twentieth Century Fox (and dropped the hyphen). At the same moment Michael Eisner began to transform and rebuild the Walt Disney Corporation. At the end of the 1980s Japan entered the fray; Sony took over Columbia Pictures, and Matsushita acquired MCA. Time and Warner merged. Viacom took over Paramount, and in 1995 Seagrams bought MCA from Matsushita. As a result, the Hollywood industry today consists of but six multinational media conglomerates: Disney, Murdoch’s Twentieth Century Fox, Seagram’s Universal, Viacom’s Paramount, Sony’s Columbia, and Time Warner’s Warner Bros.</p>
        <p>A key feature of these conglomerates is their involvement in nearly all forms of mass media. Viacom’s Paramount division, with its Simon and Schuster division leading the way, is one of the leading book publishers the world. MCA, Warner, and Sony are all top makers and distributors of recorded music—in cassettes and compact discs and whatever new forms will come. Time Warner is the world’s leader in magazines. Disney pioneered theme parks; MCA and Viacom’s Paramount are key theme park operators as well. Fox, as part of Rupert Murdoch’s News Inc. empire, is allied with leading newspapers around world. And more media convergence is on the way. The Hollywood media conglomerates presently stand at the centre of the new wortd of video, computers, and interactive media. a decade our homes and workplaces will be wired with fibre optics and will make use of even more of Hollywood’s products. As a result, the six medic conglomerates are destined to become even more diversified and powerful.</p>
        <p>Thus, a handful of companies formed more than a half century ago still have hegemony over the creation of the movies and the distribution of them throughout the world. Since the end of the Second World War the Hollywood major studios have survived the enforced selling of their theatre chains, the rise of network television, the advent of cable and pay television, the video cassette revolution, and the arrival of digitization. These companies may have nevi owners, but they show no signs of weakening—if anything, they are getting stronger. During the past decade, a number of enterprises have challenged the major studios only to lose millions of dollars and declare bankruptcy. The corporate shells of Orion and New World were always marginal at best; even the once-powerful United Artists is poised to go out of business.</p>
        <blockquote>A handful of companies formed more than a half century ago still have hegemony over the creation of the movies and the distribution of them throughout the world.

        <h3>Critical debates</h3>
        <p>As this survey suggests, historians continue to tackle the vexing problems of how best to understand the development of Hollywood as an industry. While historians need to work to find better accounts of changes in finance, ownership structure, corporate actions, modes of production, international distribution, and new technologies of presentation, they also need to challenge past ‘certainties’. Three areas of debate may be seen to be of particular importance: the significance of the studio system, the explanation of the control of Hollywood, and the identification of the appropriate analytical focus for the study of ‘Hollywood’.</p>
        <h3>The significance of the studio system</h3>
        <blockquote>It is commonplace to identify the studio system of the 1930s and 1940s as the most important—and interesting—era for film, industry study. At that time, it is believed, Hollywood filmmaking was somehow purer and uncompromised by that ‘evil of all evils’, television. Yet, while the studio era was important, it also represents only one of four fundamental eras in the history of Hollywood as industry.</p>
        <p>We like the studio era because it had a defined beginning, middle, and end. The industry was logically organized, transformed only by intrusions from the outside. This studio era began with the invention of sound, which created a peak in attendance. This high point was followed by a decline in demand caused by the Great Depression. The studio era came to a close, transformed by the Paramount antitrust decrees, sub- urbanization, and the advent of television.</p>
        <p>The six media conglomerates which dominate contemporary Hollywood now possess a power and cohesion against which the oligopoly of the Hollywood studios during the 1930s and 1940s simply pales in comparison.</p></blockquote>
        <p>However, we have to be careful not to overestimate the typicality of this one epoch, or to exaggerate its importance. Indeed, in comparison with the contemporary industry, the operations of the studio era, as explained by Bordwell, Staiger, and Thomspon (1985), seem positively quaint. Moreover, the six media conglomerates which dominate contemporary Holly- wood now possess a power and cohesion against which the oligopoly of the Hollywood studios during the 1930s and 1940s simply pales in comparison.</p>
        <h3>The explanation of the control of Hollywood</h3>
        <p>This second issue is concerned with the question of the control of Hollywood. Historians of Hollywood as industry such as Janet Wasko (1982, 1995) and her mentor Thomas Guback (1969) have argued that the Hollywood industry is controlled by financial institutions. Under this type of Marxist-influenced economics there is no reason to do any further analysis. For, as with all aspects of capitalism in the United States, the mass media industries are shaped by forces found in the investment banking community, commonly known as Wall Street.</p>
        <p>This analysis of finance capitalism, as it is known, can be found in its purest form in the argument that Hollywood in the 1930s was controlled by J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, who, it is suggested, held the balance of power within the eight major studios and their affiliated theatre and distribution channels and thus controlled Hollywood as an industry. In 1937 Klingender and Legg popularized the Morgan and Rockefeller hypothesis, and since then it has served as a corner-stone of the history of Hollywood as an industry.</p>
        <p>New work suggests that the Morgan and Rockefeller hypothesis is misleading and that the Great Depression signalled the close, not the continuation, of the epoch of finance capitalism (Gomery 1982). Bankers helped Hollywood studios get started in the 1920s, but were jettisoned as major players with the coming of the studio era, when corporate hegemony replaced control by Wall Street. It is therefore corporations, rather than bankers, that hold the key to power and control in the US motion picture industry. To consider Wall Street as other than an investor since the 1930s is to focus on the wrong issue.</p>
        <p>One can best appreciate the power of the corporations by pushing aside corporate propaganda about how tough a competitive environment these companies face and focus instead on how the major studios and their corporate owners co-operate. They have long done this through one of the least-appreciated institutions ire Hollywood industry history—the Motion Picture Association of America.</p>
        <p>Too often Hollywood historians tell us only about the Motion Picture Association of America as an agent of restraint, first through the Hays Code and today with movie ratings. But the Association is better understood as a co-operative agency, ortrade association, set up to maintain corporate power. This has meant lobbying for favourable rules in its own market of the United States and the elimination of all regulations in foreign markets.</p>
        <p>The Motion Picture Association of America was the agent that the major studios used to work for an open US market in negotiations required by the National Recovery Act in the 1930s and for an open Europe through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks in the 1990s (Gomery 1982). In both cases—and most times in between—the Association has skilfully protected its corporate owners. Indeed, protected by the Association, the Hollywood industry has demonstrated remarkable continuity. The corporations that controlled Hollywood in 1930, as the Great Depression commenced, have remained as the top corporations to the end of the century—and will probably continue to do so. No new corporation as a major studio has been created, although many have tried. Hollywood as an industry is thus best analysed and understood as one of the most enduring and powerful corporate oligopolies in the history of world business.</p>
        <h3>The analytical focus of Hollywood</h3>
        <p>Although this seems a straightforward issue, it is not. Generally, the US film industry has been seen to have a simple analytical focus, the Detroit of the movie business—Hollywood. However, this argument reduces film industry from three functions (production, distribution, and presentation) to one, filmmaking. Totake Hollywood as a single industrial centre therefor is misleading. The centre of power of the film industry based in Hollywood has, since the close of the First World War, rested with its conttol over inter- national distribution. The Hollywood industry has long dominated bookings around the globe, and film box-office figures in the United States, even with blockbusters, are small in comparison with the total take from all sources around the world. By taking advantage of size- able economies of scale, Hollywood corporations have been able to spread production over dozens of films and amortize the costs of multi-million-dollar production budgets and a global network of offices. This has also meant that their distribution costs per film have been far lower than competitors. Moreover, unlike in the United States, Hollywood companies have been able to work together abroad to ensure the distribution of their films. Through various alliances, individual foreign film companies have not simply faced a Warner Bros or Twentieth Century Fox. but the two companies (sometimes three or more) working in tandem: if films are not booked from the major Hollywood companies, under their terms, the chance of any Hollywood blockbuster may be lost (Thompson 1985; Guback 1969).</p>
        <p>To take Hollywood as a single industrial centre is misleading. The centre of power of the film industry based in Hollywood has, since the close of the First World War, rested with its control over international distribution. The Hollywood industry has long dominated bookings around the globe, and film box-office figures in the United States, even with blockbusters, are small in comparison with the total take from all sources around the world.</p>
        <p>However, if the core of Hollywood’s power has been its international control of distribution, this has inspired proportionally little scholarly research. Distribution, sadly, is the least analysed part of the industry; there are no fascinating movies to consider, only dry, dull figures, both numerical and executive, defining and producing raw power. This is why Thompson and Guback ought to be praised for the path-breaking character of their work.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion: Hollywood and economic power</h3>
        <p>If the economic oower of Holiywood derives from control of not just the production of feature films but their distribution and exhibition, it would still be wrong to exaggerate their economic might. For, despite the size of these vast empires, they generate revenue figures that pale beside a truly big business such as Exxon or General Motors. As poorly as IBM has done in the 1990s, it could absorb all of Hollywood and these mighty media conglomerates would remain but a small division.</p>
        <p>This is, perhaps, not recognized because Hollywood’s products have always taken up large portions of people’s leisure time. People in the United States watch a lot of television and film, and once we pile up all those minutes, the time commitment comes 250 billion hours per year. If we take the average houriy wage in the United States to be about $1 0, we come to a couple of trillion dollars of time invested. However, since this is not the actual amount paid for the pleasure, Hollywood as industry must ultimately be understood as a medium-sized, though highly profitable, and very influential, set of business enterprises.</p>
