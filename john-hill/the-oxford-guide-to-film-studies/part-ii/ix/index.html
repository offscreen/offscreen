        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Star System and Hollywood</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Jeremy G. Butler</h3>
        <p>The human body on screen ignites the desires of moviegoers. The actor’s performance provides an essential pleasure in the film-viewing experience. The star’s image dominates movie posters and appears on dozens of magazine covers; it is clearly one of the principal commodities that is used to market a film to an audience—equal in importance, in the minds of film producers and film viewers alike, to a compelling story or majestic scenery or a trendy director. And yet until the 1980s the presence of human bodies in motion, the impact of the actor’s performance, and significance of the star’s image were rarely discussed in film studies. Consequently, in order to understand the study of the star system, one must first ask: Why has the star system been ignored for so long by film studies?</p>
        <p>The origins of this neglect lie in the very beginnings of film theory. Early theorists were sensitive to the charge that film, as a mechanical reproduction of reality, was not a true art form. They focused their attention on the aspects of filmmaking that separated it from reality and thereby provided the artist with tools for artistic expression. A particular camera angle could make someone look smaller or larger than he or she does in reality; a lighting style could make an actor appear grotesque; wide-angle lenses could distort perspective; and so on. Film could be justified as an art form, they argued, because the filmmaker did not just mechanically reproduce reality; he or she actually manipulated reality or even fabricated an entirely new reality. Foremost among these first theorists was Lev Kuleshov (1975), who devised an editing experiment during the early 1920s. In the Kuleshov experiment, a shot of an expressionless actor was intercut with various significant objects—a bowl of soup, a baby in a coffin, and so on. (The actual components of the experiment are in doubt because no copies of it exist today.) Kuleshov maintained that spectators saw emotions in the actor’s face (hunger, sorrow, and so on) that were generated through film technique rather than the work of an actor. Meaning did not exist in the actor’s performance, but rather in the manipulation of performance through editing.</p>
        <p>Thus, Kuleshov, founder of the world’s first film school, devalued the significance of the actor’s presence in his determination to fix the cinema’s essence in editing (montage)—in which the actor’s face is no more consequential than a bowl of soup. Other film theorists from the 1920s and 1930s were also uninterested in acting and stars, choosing instead to try and ascertain the components of film art and its impact upon viewers. Stars fared little better in subsequent decades. Film scholars in the 1940s—1950s often came to the cinema with a training in literary criticism. Such individuals were well equipped to analyse narrative forms common to film and literature, but could shed little light on the work of the star. They viewed the actor, instead, as simply the body that held the character’s place on screen. It was the character’s position within a narrative structure that mattered, not the star’s embodiment of that character.</p>
        <p>This emphasis on narrative and character over actors and their work also informs two of major critical approaches to Hollywood cinema that are presented in this volume: genre and authorship studies (see Crofts and Ryall, Part 2, Chapters 7 and 8). Most genres, with the major exception of the musical, are defined mainly by the stories they tell, and this leaves little room for the consideration of performance. And so it is not surprising that most critics have interpreted genre using narrative-based methods borrowed from structural anthropology and ideological criticism. Thus, despite several meaningful intersections of star and genre (as in the case of John Wayne and the western, Lana Turner and the melodrama, Fred Astaire and the musical), the impact of stars on genres has yet to be fully assessed. Britton (1984) and Gledhill (1991 a), however, have offered some introductory thoughts.</p>
        <p>In the case of authorship study (by which is meant, principally, the so-called ‘<span>auteur theory</span>’), some concern with the star’s impact upon a film might have been expected. After all, in common parlance, movie-goers characteristically identify a film in terms of its star—as if the star were its author. For example, despite the opening credits which declare <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pretty Woman</em> (1990) to be a ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Garry Marshall film</span>’ (referring to its director), most viewers are likely to refer to it as a ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Julia Roberts movie</span>’. In some regard, then, the star is seen to be the central presence, the ‘<span>auteur</span>’, behind such a film. And, certainly, there are numerous examples of films being designed specifically for particular stars. In such cases, the star’s image has determined the overall construction of the film, even if he or she didn’t actually write the script or choose the camera angles. Even so, proponents of the auteur theory have soldom discussed the star as auteur, preferring instead to privilege the director as ‘<span>author</span>’ and to discuss his or her <em>mise-en-scéne</em>, narrative structure, and thematics. This emphasis on the director over other members of the production team derives, <em>å la</em> Kuleshov, from a conception of the ‘<span>artist</span>’ as the man or woman in control of film technique (which is principally the director). Since the actor does not govern film technique—does not, in a sense, speak the language of the cinema—he or the cannot be considered a film artist.</p>
        <p>In sum, analysis of the star system has been hampered by early film studies reliance upon antiquated aesthetic traditions—particularly conventional literary criticism and Romanticism—that are ill-equipped to deal with the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction (to invoke Walter Benjamin’s telling phrase). The attempts in the 1920s—1940s to justify the cinema as an art form according to these traditions blinded theorists to the significance of the star system. More recently, however, analytical methods from semiotics, psychoanalysis, and cultural studies have been brought to bear upon the cinema, resulting in a re-evaluation of the position of stars in the cinematic apparatus. Leading the way in this regard was a slender volume entitled <em>Stars</em>, by Richard Dyer (1979). Following Dyer, there has been a growth of writing concerned with stardom and film performance, much of which may be found in two anthologies: <em>Star Texts</em> (Butler 1991) and <em>Stardom</em> (Gledhill 1991 b).</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The fundamentals of star studios</h3>
        <p>Central to Dyer’s approach, and to that of many subsequent star studies, is the semiotics notion that stars should be studied as clusters of signs, as systems of signifiers or texts that communicate meaning to a spectator. These star texts are, of course, grounded in the lives of real human beings. There is no doubt that Mel Gibson and Demi Moore really exist. But Dyer stresses that these images are highly manipulated texts that have been fabricated, intentionally and unintentionally, through she work of the star, his or her representatives, and other cultural workers (e.g. gossip columnists, talk show hosts, end so on). Moreover, since there is no way to know a star except through media artefacts such as magazine articles and news reports, it is fruitless to search for the star’s true identity ‘<span>behind</span>’ or ‘<span>beneath</span>’ the media-constructed facade. Few of us will ever meet Gibson or Moore in person, and even if we did there is little chance that we would penetrate their media shells and glimpse their ‘<span>true identities. In so far as the viewer—analyst is concerned, the star’s identity is his or her facade—our knowledge of him or her is always filtered through media accounts. Consequently, it is impossible to know the star in any other way. The study of stars, therefore, does not aim to reveal the truth behind a star’s image—as is often the false claim of TV and magazine journalists—but rather seeks to bring out the meanings within a star’s image and to contextualize them within larger discursive structures.</p>
        <p>Having stressed the constructed, fabricated nature of star images—the existence of stars as texts—it is important to recognize that these texts do not exist in a hermetically sealed, nice-and-tidy, semiotic vacuum, Rather, star texts also exist within particular economic, ideological, and psychological contexts. Dyer and others, in this respect, recognize the importance of stars to both the cinema’s mode of production and to a film’s reception by viewers. To understand the star system fully, therefore, one must consider three inter- locking elements:</p>
        <p>1. star production: economic and discursive structures;</p>
        <p>2. star reception: social structures and the theory of the subject;</p>
        <p>3. star semiotics: intertextuality and structured polysemy.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"> Star production: economic and discursive structures</h3>
        <p> The star system is such an integral part of today’s film and television industries that it is sometimes difficult to remember that this so-called ‘<span>system</span>’ did not always exist. The early cinema survived quite nicely for over a decade without it. Indeed, actor’s names were not even listed in the credits of films at first. Using a star’s image to promote a film would have been unthinkable around the turn of the century, but by 1910 the Hollywood mode of production had shifted and the actor had become a marketable commodity. Interestingly, quite a bit of controversy surrounds accounts of the star system’s int10duction into the Hollywood mode of film production. Examining that controversy can tell us much about the position of the star in the cinematic economic apparatus, as well as illustrating more general problems associated with the writing of film history.</p>
        <p>The conventional history of the star system’s evolution—a history which has been repeated in decades of film textbooks—constructs a convenient narrative of lone-wolf independent producers initiating the star system in order to outsmart the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC). (The MPPC was a protective trade association of the most powerful production companies formed by Thomas Edison in a monopolistic attempt to control film production and exhibition.) As the story is usually told, film producers initially resisted promoting actors identities because they presumed a well-known actor would demand more money for his or her work. Also it is said that actors were ashamed of appearing in low-prestige ‘<span>flickers</span>’ and refused to have their names credited. However, the filmgoing public soon came to identify their favourites even without the aid of on-screen credits, lobby posters, or fan magazines. One such favourite was Florence Lawrence, identified by her public as the ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Biograph Girl</span>’ for her work in films produced by American Biograph, one of the members of the MPPC. In 1909 Lawrence was lured away from Biograph by an adversary of the MPPC, independent producer Carl Laemmle, of the Independent Motion Picture (IMP) Corporation. The following year, Laemmle mounted what is said to be the first promotional campaign for a film actor. Rumours were circulated—probably by IMP publicists—that Lawrence had been killed in a streetcar accident. Then Laemmle took out an advertisement in <em>Moving Picture World</em> declaring, ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">We Nail a Lie</span>’ (reproduced by Staiger in Gledhill 1991b: 4). He heatedly denied these rumours and asserted that Lawrence was not only alive and well, but that, coincidentally, a film of hers was just about to be released. The success of promotions such as this, conventional wisdom maintains, led to the independent producers triumph over the MPPC, which stodgily refused to promote its actors as stars.</p>
        <blockquote>The star system is such an integral part of today’s film and television industries that it is sometimes difficult to remember that this so-called ‘<span>system</span>’ did not always exist.</blockquote>
        <p>Film historians such as Staiger (1983) and deCordova (1990) have challenged this conventional narrative. Attractive as this story is, it is undermined by several inaccuracies and misconceptions. As deCordova points out, an MPPC company (Kalem) publicized their actors a year before Laemmle and IMP did; and the Edison Company was probably the first (in 1909) to include a cast list in the film credits. Indeed, in 1910 most MPPC companies, with the notable exception of Biograph, began to promote their stars—at the same time as the independent producers did so. Thus, the independents were not alone in using stars as a marketing device. The emergence of the star system was not an instance of the underdog independents battling the bullying MPPC, but rather was the result of a more generalized shift in the mode of production and the discourses surrounding the medium. More significant to the emergence of the star system, contemporary historians (Bordwell, Staiger, and Thompson 1935) have argued, are other discursive and economic shifts.</p>
        <p>First, in terms of aesthetic discourse, the introduction of major theatrical actors into the films of the Film D’Art and the Famous Players Film Company helped to legitimize film acting and to alter the discourse on film in general. Whereas early promotion of the cinema focused on the technology itself (objects in motion! on a screen!) and the stories presented (will the firemen rescue the endangered child?), a discourse on acting and the lives of actors began to intrude around 1909 When noted theatrical presence Sara Bernhardt appeared in <em>La Dame aux camélias</em> (France, 1912; Camille) it helped import a long tradition of performance discourse from the theatre into the movies and shifted the promotional spotlight from the technology and the narrative to the actor’s body and the actor’s life. For example, a 1912 advertisement for <em>La Dame aux camélias</em> focuses attention on the actor with some rather astonishing claims: ‘<span>Like the Noonday Sun Alone in the Blazing Majesty Giving Light and Life to Art Madame Sarah Bernhardt Illuminates the whole Motion Picture World Through Her Stupendous Genius Revealed in Her First and Only Photo Play “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">CAMILLE</span>” In which she is taking the nations by storm and making a girdle of her pictured glory around the globe</span>’ (reproduced by Staiger in Gledhill 1991 b: 13).</p>
        <p>In deCordova’s view, companies such as the Film D’Art and Famous Players changed the way actors were regarded in film. Adding to this were print media that began to publicize the off-screen existence of the performers. Although several film magazines initially slighted actors and stressed instead summaries of film the titles of <em>The Motion Picture Story Magazine</em> and <em>Photoplay</em> attest—by 1910 many of these magazines had begun running features on actors off-screen lives. This journalist discourse was an essential component in the transition of the actor from nameless body on the screen to genuine film a name and an identity that extended beyond the characters he or she played on-screen.</p>
        <p>The construction of off-screen star identities, of true star images, had a significant economic impact on the cinema. Since by the time of the First World War actors had a presence larger than their individual characters, they could now be used to distinguish one film from another. The presence of a star such as Mary Pickford, for example, could set a film apart from the dozens of others competing for viewer attention. Thus, the Hollywood mode of production quickly absorbed the star as commodity, as a source of product differentiation as significant as narrative-based genres and more powerful than studio identities. With the establishment of stars extra-filmic identities and the arrival of the star as economic commodity, the star system was complete.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"> Star reception: social structures</h3>
        <p>Once the star system was in place and formeny anonymous actors had become stars, their images began to have a social presence. This presence became quite clear in the United States in the 1920s, when several scandals illustrated the new-found significance of the motion picture star. The enormous media attention paid to the murder of director William Desmond Taylor (involving actors Mary Miles Minter and Mable Normand), actor Wallace Reid’s death from a dreg over- dose, and comedian Roscoe ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Fatty</span>’ Arbuckle’s trial for rape and murder indicates the change in position of the film actor from turn-of-the-century anonymity to 1920s notoriety. It also suggests just how forceful the star’s off-screen presence had become. It is tempting to read these events, and the images of the stars associated with them, as a reflection of the ‘<span>roaring twenties</span>’—of an era of flappers, gangsters, and ‘<span>anything goes</span>’. Indeed, it is a common presumption that star images are a reflection of society’s value. Contemoorary star studies, however, rejects this sort of ‘<span>reflectionism</span>’ as simplistic and reductive. Instead, the (many) meanings associated with a star are seen to form a part of the meaning system of that star’s society, the ideology of that particular time and place.</p>
        <p>From ideological criticism, star studies has fastened onto the basic presumption that ideology consists of the taken-for-granted values and concepts that under-pin a particular society. Moreover, it is argued that these values exist in a systemic relationship to one another and that they have ‘<span>real</span>’ social causes and effects. Ideological values are presumed to be generated by a society’s economic and social infrastructure and related to the ways that society treats individuals of different classes, races, and gender. As a result, star studies has sought to analyse the meanings of star images in relation to ideologies of class, race, and gender.</p>
        <p>Eckert (1974), for example, incorporates Freudian notions of condensation, repression, and displacement in his consideration of Shirley Temple’s position within the class discourse of the United States during the Depression. He argues that the potentially disruptive, class-based topics of work and money are repressed in Temple’s films, displaced into charity and love. Capitalist, bourgeois values, he argues, were under assault at the time of these films production and Temple helps paper over the resulting ideological fissures: by bringing together the classes (Temple’s character often romantically unites a wealthy man and a working-class woman, or vice versa) and embodying charity and love. She does snot ‘<span>reflect</span>’ 1930s values so much as process them—repressing, condensing, and displacing.</p>
        <blockquote>Picture: Shirley Temple, child-heroine of the Depression</blockquote>
        <p>Star studies often highlights this resolution of ideological conflicts by stars. Dyer adopts this approach when discussing the images of several stars, Marilyn Monroe (Dyer 1986) and Lana Turner (Dyer 1977—8), for example, are both discussed in terms of their reconciliation of conflicting gender values (innocent—sexy, ordinary—glamorous), while Paul Robeson’s connections conflicting racial discourses (African and European) form the basis of Dyer’s (1986) analysis of his work. For Dyer and others, ideology is not a monolithic, hegemonic phenomenon that crushes all opposing viewpoints—as it might be for a traditional Marxist. ideology is explored for its conflicts and contradictions, many of -which are inscribed on stars images. The ideological function that stars such as Monroe, Turner, and Robeson serve is magically to resolve those contradictions. This is an essential allure of the star: the resolution of contradictions that cannot be resolved in the social sphere, in ‘<span>real life</span>’. In this regard, stars operate in much the same way as genre narratives, which often relate mythic stories that manage the unmanageable and ‘<span>resolve</span>’ the unresolvable. Genres and stars, it has been argued, comfort the viewer because they offer fantasy solutions to social problems that cannot be resolved in reality.</p>
        <blockquote>This is an essential allure of the star: the resolution of contradictions that cannot be resolved in the social sphere, in ‘<span>real life</span>’.</blockquote>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Stars and society: the special case of feminism</h3>
        <p>Feminism and gender studies hold a special place in star studies. Feminists were among the first film scholars to publish extended considerations of stars—notably, of women stars. Molly Haskell’s <em>From Reverence to Rape</em> (1974) is filled with analyses of actors, although the consideration of stars is often eclipsed by her over-weening auteurism. Haskell discusses stars in terms of socially determined, patriarchal stereotypes that they do or do not fulfil. Mostly, she sees women stars as unique inflections of their society’s gender roles. Her comments on Greta Garbo are illustrative: ‘<span>As actress, myth, and image of woman, Garbo, like any other star, was neither wholly unique nor wholly representative. She was not like the solitary and self derived creation of the writer, on the one hand; nor was she a spontaneous eruption of the national “<span>anima</span>”, an archetypal heroine as might emerge from a truly “<span>collective</span>” art like television</span>’ (Haskell 1974: 106—7). The problem With Haskell’s perspective for subsequent feminists is that she does not examine the complicated discursive operations by which the image of woman in film reflects and refracts social realities. As she contrasts the star with the stereotype, she presumes that that stereotype is a stable, uncomplicated mirror of reality. in short, she does not develop an understanding of the star’s and the stereotype’s positions within ideological processes.</p>
        <p>This ‘<span>image-of-woman</span>’ approach predominated in feminist film studies during its formative years, the later 1960s and early 1970s. Subsequently, this method of writing about women stars has been criticized for at least two reasons: first, its reliance upon the simple ‘<span>reflection</span>’ theory of ideology; and second, its naive understanding of how the cinematic apparatus positions the female image relative to the viewer. Since the publication of Laura Mulvey’s seminal ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</span>’ (1975), feminist film study has veered off into approaches grounded in Lacanian psychoanalysis in an attempt to comprehend the process of film viewing. Informed by psychoanalytic film theory, the cinematic spectator has been renamed the ‘<span>subject</span>’, who views and interacts with the on-screen human ‘<span>object</span>’. This has had important implications for star studies because the ‘<span>theory of the subject</span>’ attempts to articulate the psychic mechanisms of desire behind the spectator’s viewing of star.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Star reception: the theory of the subject</h3>
        <p> It would seem self-evident that the relationship of the spectator-subject to the star-object is grounded in some form of visual desire, of pleasure in the image. Able look at stars because it pleases us to do so. Nobody forces or coerces us to watch Brad Pitt or Marilyn Monroe. And yet, traditional film theory had little to say about visual pleasure and desire. Voyeurism has been the unspoken pleasure of the cinema. Mulvey’s work in the mid-1970s opened the floodgates to analyses of cinematic pleasure based in Freud and the reworking of Freud by French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan.</p>
        <p>Even though Mulvey is less concerned with film stardom <em>per se</em> than with the apparatus by which visual pleasure is orchestrated, her analysis does offer some specific thoughts on the star image of Marlene Dietrich and helps clarify (from a feminist psychoanalytic perspective, at least) the star—spectator relationship. Mule vey maintains that there are two aspects of visual pleasure in classical cinema: ‘<span>The first, scopophilic, arises from pleasure in using another person as an object of sexual stimulation through sight. The second, developed through narcissism and the constitution of the ego, comes, from identification with the image seen</span>’ (Mulvey 1975: 10). Scopophilia, or voyeurism, is argued to be the key to understanding the representation of women in film. In this scenario, the viewing subject is specifically male and the viewed object is specifically female (see Creed and White, Part 1, Chapter 9 and 13 for further discussion of this argument). Although the woman connotes ‘<span>to-be-looked-at-ness</span>’ (Mulvey’s phrase), she also threatens to signify castration anxiety, Which, according to Lacan, is the foundation upon which all language and signification is constructed. The classical cinema deals with the threatening object. the woman, by either investigating and demystifying her, or turning her into a safe ‘<span>fetish object</span>’. By catering to the pleasure of the male spectator-subject, the classical cinema exists as ‘<span>an illusion cut to the measure of desire</span>’ (Mulvev 1975: 17).</p>
        <p>seems clear that many women stars are fabricated illusions cut to the measure of male desire: from Theda Bara to Jean Harlow to Lena Horne to Rita Hayworth to Kim Novak to Ann-Margret to Julie Christie to Bo Derek to Demi Moore. The castration anxiety that these women pose, in Freudian terms, is ameliorated by turning their bodies into fetish objects. Other, more threatening women are handled through containment or punishment in their story lines, Lana Turner’s Cora, in <em>The Postman always Rings Twice</em> (1946), gets away with murder, but then perishes in a car crash. Jane Greer’s Kathie Moffat, in <em>Out of the Past</em> (1947), betrays her lover but is killed at the end of the film. To psychoanalytic film theorists, the classical cinema is a phallocentric, patriarchal machine that has developed devices to check the peril embodied by women. Since stars are the most popular and the most powerful female figures in film, they are also the most capable of instigating both disruption and pleasure.</p>
        <p>Recent considerations of women in film have been critical of Mulvey and other psych0Mtalytic film theorists for their presumption of a male viewer and a masculine viewing position. What if, Hansen (1986) has queried, the viewing subject is female and the viewed object is male? Moreover, what if the viewing position for a film is designed for a feminine perspective? Hansen has written, specifically, on Rudolph Valentino, a star image successfully designed for a female audience. Her essay begins by noting the shifts in women’s social position that accompanied the First World War—specifically, their integration into a consumer economy—and the first twentieth-century wave of the women’s movement, the suffragettes, However, her central concern is the sexual politics of Valentino’s films. She argues that the deep ambivalence of Valentino’s sexuality, expressing a ‘<span>slippage of gender definitions</span>’, provides the opportunity for the taboo expression of female voyeurism. Further, Valentino also disrupts conventional sado-masochistic rituals; his masochistic femininity fissures patriarchal structures of dominance and submission. Hansen, like Mule vey, is concerned with the issue of desire and the movie star, but she inverts the genders of Mulvey’s original structure.</p>
        <blockquote>It seems clear that many wornen stars are fabricated illusions cut to the measure of male desire: from Theda Bara to Jean Harlow to Lena Horne to Rita Hayworth to Kim Novak to Ann-Margret to Julie Christie to Bo Derek to Demi Mcore.</blockquote>
        <p>Hansen’s challenge to Mulvey still exists within the bounds of Freudian psychology, but other contemporary feminists go even further in their contesting of psychoanalytic interpretations of the image of woman in film. Stacey (1994) criticizes the psychoanalytic method for a number of reasons—not the least of which is that theorists such as Mulvey (1975/1989), Doane (1987), de Lauretis (1987), <em>et al</em>. seldom deal with actual film viewers. Their theories are developed from psychoanalytical principles, and they are never tested out on viewers in a screening situation. Stacey’s approach, in contrast, grows out of ethnography, which uses interviews, surveys, viewers letters and diaries, and so on, to study the discourse of real viewers. Like Hansen, Stacey is also dissatisfied with psychoanalytic film criticism’s emphasis on the male viewer, but her book, <em>Star Gazing</em> (1 994), does not merely invert the traditional viewing situation by studying female viewers and a male viewed. Instead, she focuses on how women took at women, at images of femininity, on screen. She does so by analysing letters and surveys from British viewers about US film stars from the 1940s and 1950s. This also allows her to study viewer discourse in a specific national and historical context. Another weakness of psychoanalytic theory, she contends, is that it presumes a universal subject, one outside the determinations of class, nation, and race (for further discussion of feminist interest in stars, see White, Part 1, Chapter’ 13).</p>

        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Star semiotics: intertextuality and structured polysemy</h3>
        <p> As has been noted, Dyer’s Stars merges the sociological and ideological criticism outlined above with elements of semiotics. (And, although Dyer does occasionally borrow from Freudian psychology, his work skirts the Lacanian revision of Freud.) The semiotic approach that Dyer uses has provided the foundation for the analysis of stars as ‘<span>texts</span>’, as clusters of analysable signs, that informs much star analysis of the 1980s and 1990s. Dyer’s semiotics is grounded in the notion that, at any one particular ideological moment, a star signifies a wealth of meanings, or a ‘<span>polysemy</span>’. For Dyer, however, this polysemy is not infinite. It is seen as fabricated through a process involving ‘<span>media texts</span>’, as limited in its range, and as bearing a certain structure in the way that meanings relate systematically to one another. In his own words, ‘<span>From the perspective of ideology, analyses of stars, as images existing in films and other media texts, stress their structured polysemy, that is, the finite multiplicity of meanings and affects they embody and the attempts so to structure them that some meanings and affects are foregrounded and others are masked or displaced</span>’ (Dyer 1979: 3). It is worth stressing that Dyer does not see the range of meanings attached to a star as being unbounded. Doubtless it would be possible, for example, to find an individual who believes that Kevin Costner is descended from a race of space aliens, but such an individual exists outside the realm of contemporary ideology. Textual analysis, therefore, concerns itself with articulating the range of possible meanings that may be read in a star’s image at a particular ideological moment (even if it does not speak to the actual interpretation of specific stars by real viewers—as is attempted in ethnographic work such as Stacey’s).</p>
        <p>For semioticians, the star image is constructed through media texts. These texts consist of a variety of phenomena: performances in films, articles in print publications, posters in theatre foyers, and so on. They have been grouped by Dyer into four types:
        <p>1. promotion;</p>
        <p>2. publicity;</p>
        <p>3. film roles/characters;</p>
        <p>4. criticism and commentary on those roles.</p>
        <p>Dyer seeks to distinguish promotion and publicity, although he recognizes that these two often overlap. Promotional texts consist of materials designed by the star and/or his or her minions in the deliberate attempt to manufacture a favourable image of the star, A poster for <em>Niagara</em> (1953), for example, proclaims ‘<span>Marilyn Monroe and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Niagara</span>” raging torrent of emotion that even nature can’t control!</span>’ (in Dyer 1979: 123)— with an illustration that blends an enormous version of Monroe’s body with Niagara Falls itself. Obviously, Twentieth Century-Fox’s promotional department is here emphasizing the animal, ‘<span>natural</span>’ sexuality of Monroe’s image.</p>
        <p>Publicity texts, in contrast, are those that are uncontrolled by the star. When print media published reports that Roseanne, while a teenager, had given up a child for adoption, the star made public efforts to suppress this information. Despite her efforts, the story was released so the public. When articles about the incident appeared they affected how Roseanne’s mothering skills (a central component of the meanings attached to her image) were understood. Though there is little doubt that Roseanne did not plant this piece of publicity, there are many cases in which the line between publicity and promotion are blurred or erased—such as when IMP spread rumours of Florence Lawrence’s death.</p>
        <p>Roseanne’s perceived poor mothering skills (‘<span>abandoning</span>’ her child, in the parlance of the tabloid press) relate to other media texts: specifically, her role as a mother in a popular television sitcom. Although it might sec initially that, in this case, one element of the star’s ‘<span>textuality</span>’ is conflicting with another, these two components actually fit together quite well. For the type of mother that Roseanne portrays in <em>Roseanne</em> is a sharp, sarcastic one who often makes disparaging remarks to her children. On television her maternal sarcasm is vitiated by her overarching ability to solve any domestic crisis and eventually provide each child with the nurturing he or she requires. The publicity about her as a bad mother does not contradict her on-screen role, although it does heighten one anti-nurturing component of it. Roseanne, as with all true stars, possesses an image constructed from interlocking media texts. Or, in other words, her polysemy is generated by the intertextuality of numerous media texts.</p>
        <p> Intertextuality is a key component to understanding stars. According to Dyer, stars are separated from non-star actors by their presence in more than one area of tie general media textuality. If an actor is only known for his or her character—as with many soap opera actors—then he or she has no intertextuality and is not truly a star. A star must appear in numerous texts, which play off one another. Thus, one could say that a star is defined by his or her intertextuality, by the ability to correlate various media texts.</p>
        <p>The relationship of a star to the characters he or she plays is an interesting and complex one. Few viewers belive that the star actually is the character—even if they do bear the same name, as with Roseanne and her character Roseanne Conner—and yet characteristics of the character do align with characteristics of the star’s image, and vice versa. Once a star is well established, the characters that he or she plays may fit the star image in one of three ways, according to Dyer (1979:142-9):</p>
        <p>1. selective use;</p>
        <p>2. perfect fit;</p>
        <p>3. problematic fit.</p>
        <p>In the first instance, the character makes selective use of elements of a star’s polysemy. During the 1940s, as Damico (1975) points out, Ingrid Bergman’s polysemy contained seemingly contradictorv sexual meanings. She was associated with a certain spiritual purity as well as a coarse sexuality. In her role as Joan of Arc (in <em>Joan of Arc</em>, 1948) her spirituality was ‘<span>selected</span>’ while her practically sordid earthiness was disregarded. Later, when her sexual liaison with Roberto Rossellini became public knowledge, other more sexually ambiguous elements of her polysemy were selected in roles such as Isabelle in Rossellini’s <em>Viaggio in Italia</em> (‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Italy</span>’, Italy, 1953).</p>
        <p>Dyer’s perfect fit occurs when the character and the star’s polysemy appear to be completely matched. It is almost as if the star has become the character. When Hugh Grant appeared in <em>Nine Months</em> (1995) he played Samuel Faulkner, an irresponsible playboy who was unable to commit to marriage. This fit closely with media texts describing his arrest with a prostitute just a few months previously. Indeed, in an odd juxtaposition of the fictional and the real, his police mug shot circulated in the media at the same tirne that previews for <em>Nine Months</em> were featuring a fictional mug shot. The sexual indiscretions of Grant the star perfectly fit the character of Grant in the film. The fit between Grant and Faulkner was often commented upon in various media texts and led to anecdotes such as this one, appearing in <em>People Online</em> (24 July 1995): ‘<span>Grant (as Faulkner in <em>Nine Months</em>) is parked in his car with a sexy woman other than the woman with whom he shares his</span>’ life. This hot number asks him if he would like to come up for coffee. He declines. “<span>How about for sex, then?</span>” she asks. At the screening I attended, an audience member yelled out, “<span>I’ll pay for it</span>”. The implication that the <em>People</em> reporter is making is that viewers were finding humour in the blending of the behaviours and identities of the character and the star. Note also the use of Grant’s, the actor’s, name to resisr to the character’s conduct. Of course, it is common practice for popular magazines to refer to characters with the names of actors, but in this context <em>People</em>’s use of ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Grant</span>’ to refer to Faulkner further accentuates the perfect fit between star and character.</p>
        <p>The problematic fit is the least common instance of character—star relations. In this case, the star is cast against his or her image. The role is the polar opposite of her or her image. One example is comedian Mary Tyler Moore’s appearance in <em>Ordinary People</em> (1980). Her star image as a perky, upbeat, loving, and lovable woman had been firmly established through television roles in <em>The Dick Van Dyke Show</em> (1961-6) and <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em> (1970-7), but in <em>Ordinary People</em> her character is a cold, remote mother of a troubled teenager. Very little of her star image was selected to construct that role. In Dyer’s view, the problematic fit can have distinctive ideological significance as the star is called upon to reconcile social tensions. One could argue, for example, that the position of woman in the family was particularly unstable in 1980 in the United States after more than a decade of feminist activism, shifts in family economics that demanded more women working outside the home, and the landslide election of Ronald Reagan and the presumed endorsement of his conservative agenda. What better image to work through these tensions than a latter-day Mary Pickford, ‘<span>America’s sweetheart</span>’ for the 1980s? Dyer’s use of semiotics contributes key elements to the study of stars, but it is not a systematic, global semiotics of the cinema. In fact, Dyer makes little use of the ground-breaking work of 1960s-1970s film semioticians such as Metz (1974a, b) and Heath (1981). Metz, Heath, and most conventional film semioticians have, in turn, been remarkably mute about the significance of the star. However, a few recent theorists associated with <em>Screen</em> and the British Film Institute have attempted to apply the rigour of semiotics to the study of stars. Thompson (1978) introduces the notion of the ‘<span>commutation test</span>’ to the study of performance. This concept is borrowed from early Barthes, and, although Thompson himself rejects commutation in a later article, we may still find it a useful method for contrasting stars polysemies. In the commutation test, one alters one component of a text’s signifiers and then examines what effect that change has on its signifieds. What if, for example, the character—performance signifiers created for the role of Scarlett O’Hara (<em>Gone with the Wind</em>, 1939) by Vivien Leigh had been generated by Bette Davis? Or what if Cary Grant, instead of Dustin Hoffmann, had played Ratso Rizzo (<em>Midnight Cowboy</em>, 1969)? The shift in meaning that these hypothetical recastings cause tells us something about the signifying power of those particular stars. This is particularly evident if the commutation test is grounded in actual recastings that can be compared and contrasted. A film and its remake provide such an opportunity. Although a remake frequently makes changes that are too broad for the commutation test, one can usually find individual scenes that are repeated verbatim and can be used to highlight the differences between two actors. For example, if you view the two versions of <em>Imitation of Life</em> (1934, 1959), you’ll note sharp differences in the performance styles of Claudette Colbert and Lana Turner and you may draw conclusions about their star images based on those differences.</p>
        <p>Another notable strain in the 1980s <em>Screen</em>—BFl work is Barry King’s (1985) ‘<span>cultural materialist</span>’ approach to performance and stardom. For King, the star text catalyses certain ‘<span>discursive resources</span>’ (meaning-generating phenomena) relevant to the cinema, ‘<span>the cultural economy of the human body as a sign the economy of signification in film, and the economy of the labour market for actors</span>’ (King 1985:27). Each of these ‘<span>economies</span>’ governs the production of meaning by star actors. King, significantly, does not limit himself to the discursive strategies of the film text, but also explores the influence of ‘<span>practical</span>’ matters (such as the availability of work for actors) upon the meanings associated with stardom.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Star studies: the current situation</h3>
        <p>Star studies is still in a rather embryonic state, It seems clear that the most productive approaches to stars are ones that will help us comprehend the economic significance, cultural meanings, and psychic pleasures associated with star images, but there is no one clear path to that goal. The ethnographic and ideological, semiotic, and psychoanalytic approaches to stars surveyed here are important attempts to rectify the decades of neglect that stardom has suffered. Until film studies comes to an understanding of the significance of stars and the star system it will have only a partial comprehension of the cinematic apparatus.</p>
