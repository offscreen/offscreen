        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Genre and Hollywood</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Tom Ryall</h3>
        <p>It is an irony that the critical acceptance of Hollpwood cinema was initially achieved through its extensive mapping, by the critics of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinéma</em>, in terms of authorial æuvres rather than in terms of the genres that, along with the stars, have defined its image forthe moviegoing public. For whatever else it is, Hollywood is surety a cinema of genres, a cinema of westerns, gangster films, musicals, melodramas, and thrillers. Indeed, in early reflections on Hollywood cinema, it was this very quality that generated antagonistic critcism, with generic structures being deemed an impediment to artistic achievement. Thus, Paul Rotha, writing in the late 1920s, attacked Hollywood for its standardized pictures made to type (genre). He regarded this as a debasement of cinema inhibiting the creation and developrnent of film art characteristic of European filmmakers from countries such as France and, especially, Germany (Rotha 1930/1967). While his characterization of the American cinema in terms of its standardized generic basis certainly captures one of its significant features, subsequent generations of writers, especially from the late 1960s onwards, have valued such qualities differently. Some have argued that the genre system was a positive quality in Hollywood, providing a useful disciplined framework within which directors worked, ensuring curbs on creative indulgence and guaranteeing that the cinema kept in touch with its mass public (McArthur 1972). At the very least, most writers have seen genre as a necessary conceptual tool in relation to American films, and the body of criticism to be discussed here is predominantly concerned with the understanding of genre as a conceot and with the definition of individual genres.</p>
        <p>The critical literature of genre is both extensive and multifaceted, reflecting influences from a range of disciplines including literary criticism, art history, linguistics and semiotics, and structural anthropology, as well as from the discourses of the film industry itself and from journalistic film criticism and reviewing. But while some agreement may be found about basic terms such as ‘<span>convention</span>’, ‘<span>iconography</span>’, ‘<span>recurrent patterns</span>’, ‘<span>audience expectation</span>’, and the typology of generic modes (westerns, gangster films, etc.), it is important to note that different models, different sets of assumptions, and different theories underpin the range of accounts that address the generic system of Hollywood and the individual genres in that system, and, at the micro-level, account for the specificities of indi- vidual films. As a further cornplication, ‘<span>genre</span>’ itself is sometimes replaced by and sometimes situated in relation to a constellation of cognate terms such as ‘<span>type</span>’, ‘<span>mode</span>’, ‘<span>cycle</span>’, ‘<span>series</span>’, and ‘<span>formula</span>’. Although important accounts of genre in cinema can be traced back to at least the 1950s (Bazin 1953/1971; Warshow 1948/1970, 1954/1970; Alloway 1963, 1971), it was not until the late 1960s that something like a corpus of genre criticism emerged in Britain, principally, though not exclusively, from writers working in, or associated in some way with, the Education Department of the British Film Institute (Lovell 1967; Kitses 1969; McAfthur 1972; Buscombe 1970; Ryall 1970). Subsequently, the turn to semiotics meant that more attention was paid to underlying systems, to general explanations of communicative phenomena such as genre films, and to attempts to define genre itself as well as defining individual genres. However, some have seen this as an inherently difficult task because of the medley of ways in which individual genres have been identified, with classifications deriving from a varied list of features embracing subject-matter, mode of address, style, audience effects, and so on. David Bordwell has suggested that ‘<span>theorists have been unsuccessful in producing a coherent map of the system of genres and no strict definition of a single genre has won widespread acceptance</span>’ and that ‘<span>no strictly deductive set of principles can explain genre groupings</span>’ (1 989: 147). He cites the Russian Formalist Boris Tomashevsky, whose View was that ‘<span>no firm logical classification of genres is possible. Their demarcation is always historical, that is to say, it is correct only for a specific moment of history; apart from this they are demarcated by many features at once, and the markers of one genre may be quite different in kind from the markers of another genre and logically tiney may not exclude one another</span>’ (Bordwell 1989: 147).</p>
        <p>Problems of definition notwithstanding, for many critics ‘<span>genre</span>’ seemed more appropriate than traditional approaches for grasping the historical realities of Hollywood with its factory-like production regimes and the organization of production schedules along generic lines. Creative and technical production personnel were hired on long-term contracts which, in some ways, could determine a generic structure. As Edward Buscombe has suggested, ‘<span>stars and genre were, particularly at Werners, mutually reinforcing Because the studio had Bogart, Cagney and the rest under contract they made a lot of gangster pictures; and because they made a lot of gangster pictures they had stars like this under contract</span>’ (1 974:59). Elaborate standing sets—the western townscape, the Chicago street—-once constructed, the costume collection once established) reinforced generic tendencies; as Rick Altman has put it, ‘<span>Hollywood’s, economic imperative mandates concerted attempts at economy of scale. Only by producing large quantities of similar films (could) studios justify their enormous investment in real estate, personnel, publicity and technology</span>’ (1989: 328). Films were marketed and advertised in ways which highlighted their generic specificity and, in addition to this, the trade press used generic terminology and referred to westerns gangster pictures, melodramas, and so on in their discussion of Hollywood films. Hollywood studios consciously produced genre cycles, audiences went to see westerns and the like rather than films made by auteurs, and reviewers referred to gangster films and other film types; accordingly, for critics such as Lawrence Alloway (1 971), this meant that genre was the pertinent and pre-eminent critical concept for students of the American film.</p>
        <p>The auteur approach absorbed cinema into conventional ways of thinking about cultural production and appeared to confer a certain respectability on popular films, permitting their ‘<span>creators</span>’—the auteurs—to be discussed as artists along with the poets, painters, composers, and novelists. Genre criticism confronted aspects of popular film—conventionality, formulas, stars, industrial production systems, publicity—which jarred with conventional approaches to artistic production and were often overlooked by auteur critics. It moved against the grain of a criticism dominated both by the individual work valued for its distinctiveness and difference, and by the individual artist valued for the extent to which he or she moved beyond the common to the individual and the personal. The central assumption of genre criticisrn is that a work of art and communication arises from and is inserted into a specific social context and that its meaning and significance is constrained and limited by this context. Individual artists and filmmakers manipulate signs and meanings, but in contexts which are authorized by communal public consent, and these contexts, in the case of the American cinema, we call genres. The ‘<span>rules</span>’ of a genre—the body of conventions—specify the ways in which the individual work is to be read and understood, forming the implicit context in which that work acquires significance and meaning. Genres were seen in social terms as institutions implying a bond, or contract, between producers (director, studio) and audience relating to the significance and meaning of what was on the screen. In a different vocabulary, genres constituted systems for the regulation and circulation of meaning which had a public and historical existence and in which the popular American cinema was grounded.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The scope of genre criticism</h3>
        <p>At the most general of levels, genres have been divided into two kinds—the theoretical and the historical (Todorov 1975: 13—14). Theoretical genres are a priori categories which it is possible to envisage as based upon logical deduction from the basic characteristics of the art form itself rather than the analysis of actual works. For example, the ancient Greeks devised theoretical systems for fictional works which were divided into genres on the basis of mode of delivery, i.e. those in which the narrator speaks, those in which characters speak, and those in which both speak. As can be seen, the intention is exhaustively to predict the gamut of possibilities based upon certain assumptions about the key element of literary activity—in this example, the performance of the speech act (Palmer 1991: 116). In terms of cinema, an equivalent exercise would base itself on the possibilities of cinema relation to some very general feature such as representation, rather than the familiar divisions of western, gangster film, and musical. Accordingly, films could be divided into the <em>fictional</em> (representation of staged events), the <em>documentary</em> (representation of actual events), or the <em>abstract</em> (non-representational), although even such a broad scheme may have problems with the animated film. Some writers have explicitly proposed theoretical genres for cinema (e.g. Shklovsky 1927; Williams 1984), and others, including V. F. Perkins for example, have implicitly constructed the beginnings of a system of theoretical genres in suggesting that the ‘<span>basic genre to inspect is the narrative movie</span>’ (Movie 1975: 11). Most critical writing, however, has concentrated on historical genres, on groupings of actual films inductively linked on the basis of common themes, styles, and iconography.</p>
        <p>In terms of the analysis of historical genres, the scope of genre criticism is broad, and, as a preliminary, it is necessary to distinguish between three levels analysis to which the concept can refer, The first, and most general, concerns the definition of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">generic system</em>, which relates individual genres to each other in terms of broad shared principles the second is the analysis of <em>individual genres</em>, defining their internal logics and conventions; and the third is the analysis of <em>individual films</em> in relation to a genre or genres in the case of the many Hollywood pictures which draw from and relate to more than a single genre. It is also necessary to distinguish between the discussion of generic systems and individual genres as overarching concepts, and the analysis of the individual genre film. Generic systems and genres do not exist .in the way in which individual films exist, but rather are abstractions based partly, though not entirely, upon individual films and operating in a different logical universe. Although genre and the individual film are the basic eiements of the system, as Fredric Jameson has suggested in relation to literary genres, they are wholly distinct in nature from each other, the one—the generic system—being a constellation of ideal relationships, but the other—the work itself—being a concrete verbal composition. We must understand the former as constituting something like an environment for the latter, which emerges into a world in which the genres form a given determinate relationship among themselves, and which then seeks to define itself in terms of that relationship. (Jameson 1975: 153)</p>
        <p>If ‘<span>film</span>’ is substituted for ‘<span>verbal composition</span>’ we have a succinct definition of the circuit in which a genre film is positioned as a historically fornned instance of the over-arching intertextual entity we refer to as the generic system. From the point of view of the filmmaker, the generic system is the conceptual environment within which the film will be situated, and, from the point of view of the spectator, the conceptual intertextual context, or one of the contexts, within which the individual film makes sense.</p>
        <p>There are Owo further broad dimensions to genre study. The first involves genre history and is concerned with the ways in which genres emerge, develop, and chancle; the second focuses upon the social and cultural function of genre cinema. Genres change and evolve and, although a western such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em> (1956) is recognizably part of a continuum shich includes its generic predecessors such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stagecoach</em> (1939) or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gunfighter</em> (1 950), the film nevertheless differs from them in certain respects because it was made at a different moment both of the history of the genre itself and, more generally, of the history of the social and political environment. Genres can be studied both in terms of an internal history of forms, themes, and iconography, and in terms of their relationship to broader cultural and social shifts. Thomas Schatz (1 981 : 38) has proposed an evolutionary model for internal generic development based on a shift from ‘<span>straightforward story-telling to self-conscious formalism</span>’, from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gold Diggers of 1933</em> (1933) to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Singing in the Rain</em> (1952) for the musical, from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stagecoach</em> to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em> for the western. Others, however, have been sceptical about the neatness of such historical patterning and its somewhat segregated view of individual genres. Steve Neale’s (1090) brief but suggestive sketch of the historical development of Hollywood’s genres, derived from the ‘<span>Formalist conception of genre as a historical system of relations</span>’, moves away from Schatz’s somewhat self-contained account of generic change in favour of a more fluid historical rnodel which links change to a range of factors. Some are internal to cinema such as the state of filrn technology; some are external and relate film genres to intermedia influences such as vaudeville theatre, popular literature and music, the press and comics, and to changing social patterns of cinema attendance (Neale 1990: 58-62).</p>
        <p>Consideration of the social and cultural function of cinema has provided other ways of defining a rationale for the Hollywood genre system (see Kellner, Part 2, Chapter 10). For some, the system is part of the <em>ideological</em> network which constrains political perception and regulates attitudes towards social and cultural tensions and conflicts; for others, it is more akin to <em>mythic</em> systems of the past, and it has been suggested that ‘<span>genre films, television, and literature have to a great extent replaced more formal versions of mythic response to existence such as religion and folk-tale</span>’ (Stuart Kaminsky, quoted in Grant 1 986:94). Ideological critiques range from the notion that Hollywood genres are instruments of American capitalist ideology transmitting its beliefs and values in their different ways (Hess Wright 1974) to more nuanced versions which suggest that, while some genres might well be regarded as ‘<span>conservative</span>’, others, such as horror, film noir, and melodrama, may be seen to question conventional social and political values (Klinger 1984). Writers using the notion of ideology are committed to the idea that the genre system, or, at least, certain genres, impose beliefs and values to some degree; those using notions of myth and ritual posit a more participatory situation in which the audience plays a role in the constitution of the cinema’s value systems through box-office acclaim and other interactive mechanisrns such as fan magazines and clubs, sneak previews, and so on. Ideological criticism sometimes operates with the model of a passive audience absorbing the appropriate social and political values, and this contrasts with ritual—myth analyses in which the genre system is construed as expressive of deep-seated beliefs and desires ‘<span>whose function is the ritualisation of collective ideals, the celebration of temporarily resolved social and cultural conflicts, and the concealment of disturbing cultural conflicts behind the guise of entertainment</span>’ (Schatz, in Grant 1986: 97).</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Genre systems: some theoretical proposals</h3>
        <p>A brief examination of the familiar generic categories—western, gangster films, musicals, horror films, thrillers, comedies, melodramas, films noirs, women’s pictures—indicates the variety of ways in which critics have attempted to define genre systems and individual genres. These range from simple differentiation based on an array of protocols enveloping subject-matter, style, effects, and intended audience; to attention to the ways in which shared elements of subject-matter, theme, or style are handled differently in different genres; to the technical distinctions of semantics and syntactics that can generate a range of combinatory options or genres.</p>
        <p>The ‘<span>familiar</span>’ list above incorporates a variety of differentiating criteria. Understandings of westerns and gangster films derive from the historical subject which is dealt with: the American west and urban America in the 1920s respectively. The musical is recognized in terms of formal qualities such as the presence of musical and dance performance. This can be linked to a range of subject-matters including that of the western—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</em> (1954)— and the gangster film—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Guys and Dolls</em> (1955). Some genres can be defined in ways which highlight their intended effect on the audience, as in the horror film, the thriller, and the comedy, which elicit fear, suspense, and laughter respectively. Again, these are effects that are realizable across different subject-matters. Melodrama has been defined in terms of a concern with the tensions of domestic life, with intergenerational problems, with heterosexual romance (subject-matter), together with a certain approach to narrative construction and filrn style and, particularly, an extravagant use of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scéne</em> to embody the emotional highpoints of the drama (formal qualities). In similar fashion, attempts to define the film noir usually range across subject-matter—crime and detection—and the shadow-laden <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> which is often regarded as the essential generic ingredient. The category of the women’s picture, closely related to the melodrama and sharing its subject-matter to an extent, is based on the nominated target audience of females and their supposed desires and interests.</p>
        <p>From the late 19b0s onwards there were a number of books and articles which attempted to systematize the varied bases for differentiation, and which sought to construct overall theories of genre, schema for generic definition, and definitions of individual genres (Buscombe 1970; Kitses 1969; McArthur 1972; Ryall 1970). Based primarily on the western and the gangster film, such work isolated two factors in particular. These were, first, the two distinct phases of American history which constituted the basic subject-matter of the two genres, and secondly, the distinctive visual qualities which each possessed. This latter dimension—‘<span>iconography</span>’, as it was named with a term borrowed from art history—was seen by many critics as the key source of differentiation, providing individual genres with a distinctive evocation of a generic universe by way of a repertoire of established and conventionalized images. In the case of the western, those included the settings (desert and mountain, makeshift townscapes of saloons and gaols); the specificities of costume (the black garb of the hired gun, the tight-bodiced dress of the saloon-girl); the weaponry used by westerners (Colt 4.5, Bowie knife, bow and arrow); and horses. The gangster genre also lent itself to such analysis with its urban, street-at-night settings, its night-clubs and bootleg liquor factories; the gangster’s fedora and well-tailored suit; and the cars and tommy-guns which were the gangster’s tools of the trade. However, while this approach appears coherent and plausible when applied to the western and gangster genres, it seems less easy to translate across the generic spectrum. What, for example, would constitute an iconography of the comedy film?</p>
        <p>Colin McArthur centred the iconographic description of the gangster film on the physical presence and dress of the leading actors in the genre, thus incorporating the star system into his generic account (McArthur 1972). Such an approach also characterizes Jean-Loup Bourget’s account of a particular strand of melodrama variously referred to as ‘<span>sentimental melodrama</span>’, ‘<span>romantic drama</span>’, and ‘<span>the women’s picture</span>’ (1971). Such a strand, he suggests, is grounded in the acting presences of an array of female stars including Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck and Lana Turner. The iconographic approach, "couched in terms of stars, whose presence shapes and determines the course of the narrative, would be applicable across a range of genres and would at least enable the construction of coherent generic strands (subgenres?) on a consistent basis. Accordingly, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson may be seen to define a powerful subgenre of gangster film; John Wayne and Henry Fonda, of the western; Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum of the film noir; Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, and Gene Kelly, of the musical; Chaplin, Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx brothers, of the and so on. In some cases—Cagney and Robinson and the gangster genre, Wayne and the western, Astaire and Kelly and the musical—it can be argued that such stars have defined the generic prototypes which tend tot dominate thinking about particular genres. A further point to make is that there are plenty of examples of stars who have worked in particular genres without forging generic identity in the manner of the stars cited above, For example, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy both played gangster roles in the early 1930s, but it was Cagney and Robinson whose performances clearly impressed in generic terms. This suggests that other factors play a role in such generic identification and that certain stars are suitable for certain genres rather than others.</p>
        <p>The writers cited above differed in their degree of systematicity, but provided models of genre which highlighted certain key dimensions such as iconography and stars which worked as explanations for some genres but not all. This work foregrounded concepts such as ‘<span>convention</span>’ and ‘<span>audience expectation</span>’ which are central to any account of genre, and presented persuasive specifications for genres such as the western and the gangster film. However, the work did not provide an easy means of moving from local description of specific genres to general specification of the generic system, and what worked for the gangster film did not necessarily translate easily into an explanation for, say, the musical. This early work on genre emerged from an intellectual climate in Britain which was just beginning to accommodate the structuralist theories that were to have a decisive impact on film studies through the 1970s, and there is a sense in which a number of the issues raised by genre critics were taken up in different ways by the new intellectual-cum-political interests of areas such as semiotics, ideology, psychoanalysis, and feminist theory.</p>
        <p>Steve Neale’s Genre (1980) attempted to redefine genre in the context of such influences and to provide the terms in which the system of genre worked in Hollywood cinema. Previous writers had noted that American genre films belonged ‘<span>to the traditions of the American narrative film</span>’ (Pye 1975: 31) and, for Neale, this basic shared feature was the foundation of the genre system in Hollywood. Genres, it was suggested, v. ye best considered as variants of ‘<span>the traditions of the American narrative film</span>’, or ‘<span>classical narrative cinema</span>’ as it was increasingly called. Its set of broad formal characteristics such as linear narrative progression, closure, symmetry, its balance of narration and spectacle, as well as its ‘<span>characteristic semantic fields</span>’ (Bordwell 1989: 150—1), defined very broadly a type of narrative film which was different from other models such as the European ‘<span>art</span>’ film. Neale’s work recognized that the Hollywood genre system deployed a limited number of themes in a restricted stylistic context and the factor which differentiated one genre from another was the weight and function of the form and content of the shared general discourse of the system. For example, as many critics have noted, heterosexual romance and desire are present in most, and maybe all, Hollywood films as a key constitutent of the ‘<span>characteristic semantic field</span>’. However, it is not a uniform presence: whereas romance between the leading characters is an essential feature of the musical, providing the crucial motivation for the progress of the narrative, such relationships are often peripheral to the narrative in the western. The musical <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Singing in the Rain</em> traces the romance which develops between Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) within a story about Hollywood and the arrival of the sound film; the western <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Darling Clementine</em> (1946) traces a story about the bringing of civilization to the west which has, as an aside, an embryonic romantic encounter between Wyatt Earp (Henry Fonda) and Clementine Carte? (Cathy Downs). The certain union of Don and Kathy at the end of the musical is a generic requirement; the rather more tentative finale of the western, in which the hero and heroine part with vague promises of reuniting, is also appropriate in the context of a genre where romance is a secondary concern. The generic system, therefore, is a way of differentially deploying the characteristic discourses of Hollywood films, including romance and other forms of human relationships, violence, social order and disorder, the law, community, work and leisure, current affairs and popular history, and so on. None of these, however, are exclusive to any of the genres. A parallel account is offered for. matters of style and narrative address in which the balance between narrative (the advancement of the story) and spectacle (the display of action and performance) varies from genre to genre. Neale summarizes thus: ‘<span>part of the very function of genres is precisely to display a variety of the possibilities of the semiotic processes of mainstream narrative cinema while simultaneously containing them as genre</span>’ (1980: 31).</p>
        <p>Rick Altman, also working in the context of strut surealism and semiotics, has suggested that genres can be established from two perspectives:</p>
        <blockquote>we can as a whole distinguish between generic definitions which depend on a list of common traits, attitudes, characters, shots, locations, sets and the like—thus stressing the semantic elements which make up the genre—and definitions which play up instead certain constitutive relationships between undesignated and variable placeholders—relationships which might be called the genre’s fundamental syntax. The semantic approach stresses the genre’s budding blocks, while the syntactic view privileges the structures into which they are arranged. (Altman 1989: 95)</blockquote>
        <p>The same genre—for example, the western—-can be analysed into two distinct, though interrelated, dimensions. First, there is the stock of primary elements embracing themes such as the wiiderness, the community, law and order, and icons such as cowboys, Indians, deserts, mountains, and half-built towns These correspond to the thematic and iconographic elements highlighted by previous writers and constitute a semantic field present in some way in any single instance of the western. Secondly, there are particular structural relationships between such elements established over time to constitute a set of syntactical conventions. Jean Mitry’s definition of the western as a genre ‘<span>whose action, situated in the American West, is consistent with the atmosphere, the values, and the conditions of existence in the Far West between 1840 and 1900</span>’ (quoted in Altman 1984: 10) highlights the broad semantic field underpinning the genre. In contrast, Jim Kitses (1969) analysis of the genre fore-grounds the ways in which particular semantic elements, such as individual and community or savagery and civilization, are placed in opposition to each other, and offers a different way of defining the western in terms of the syntactic or relational structures between the elements specified in the broad semantic field. The semantic perspective offers broad inclusive definitions identifying fixed and recurrent elements which cross all instances of the genre, while the syntactic perspective focuses on narrow, exclusive definitions drawing attention to particular distinctive patterns established between semantic elements in subsets of the semantic genre.</p>
        <p>Much of the writing on genre from Bazin and War-show onwards had built effective categories in a local way, separating off the western from the gangster film in quite clear terms (subject-matter, history, iconography). By contrast, the structuralist-influenced work recognized the somewhat unstable of the generic system. Subject-matter, style, narrative address and structure, iconography even, were quite fluid, and elements associated with particular genres often cropped up across a range of genres and operated in a number of different ways, sometimes occupying a central position within a genre, sometimes relegated to a peripheral significance. To take a previously noted example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</em> clearly operates within the semantic field of the western although its title suggests other concerns. It is set in ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Oregon Territory 1850</span>’ (the post-credit title) and opening sequences show a figure in buckskins (Adam—Howard Keel) driving a wagon into a frontier town. However, the film’s credits are accompanied by orchestral versions of two of the main songs from the film—‘<span>Bless your Beautiful Hide</span>’ and ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Wonderful Day</span>’——and, it might be argued, the musical motifs undercut the ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">western</span>’ images. Similarly, the opening-sequence in the store, in which Adam, a farmer in buy winter supplies, adds a Wife to the shopping-list, foregrounds the ‘<span>romantic courtship</span>’ theme usually peripheral to the genre though, in this case, clearly announced by the film’s title. When Adam leaves the store and launches into song the generic focus is sharpened and the world of the musical is evoked through one of its central conventions, which permits characters to sing about their thoughts and feelings. From the perspective of structuralist versions of genre, it is the musical conventions that dominate and direct spectator comprehension towards the values and assumptions of that genre rather than those of the western, to which it also clearly relates. This is only a problem if we regard genres as pigeon-holes into which films must fit, rather than elements in a flexible conceptual fluid framework for our reading of individual Hollywood films.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Individual genres: inclusive and exclusive definitions</h3>
        <p>Another way of recognizing the somewhat fluid nature of generic systems rests on the distinction between inclusive and exclusive definition (Altman 1984: 6—7), Semantic definitions of genre tend to be inclusive, incorporating as many films as possible, while syntactic definitions are exclusive and focused on a small number of films. Inclusive definitions, the characteristic province of tine large encyclopaedias of the genre (Buscombe 1988; Hardy 1985), also usually reflect the ways in which the terms are used in everyday common-sense discourse and by ‘<span>the studios themselves</span>’. Such definitions envelop a range of films with some degree of intertextual relationship to each other but without laying claim that these relationships are strong or especially significant. These might be regarded as involving a ‘<span>weak</span>’ or ‘<span>neutral</span>’ use of the generic term. By contrast, other accounts of the western operate what might be called a ‘<span>strong</span>’ sense of genre and imply precise and significant interrelationships between individual westerns, André Bazin, for example, identified a small corpus of films as embodying the ‘<span>essence</span>’ of the western and positioned Instances of the genre in relation to this core (Bazin 1971: 149). Accordingly, individual films were located in relation to what Bazin called the ‘<span>classic</span>’ western, exemplified by films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stagecoach</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Virginia City</em> (1941), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Western Union</em> (1941). Bazin also developed contrasting categories such as tine ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">superwestern</span>’ for films from the 1950s like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon</em> (1952) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shane</em> (1952) that deviated from the classical norms and imported concerns foreign to the genre, and the ‘<span>novelistic</span>’ western for films such as Johnny Guitar (1954) that represent an enrichment of the traditional themes of the genre.</p>
        <p>In fact, although exclusive definitions are rarely proclaimed explicitly, they have proved extremely influential, constituting the effective operative contexts for discussion of individual westerns and dominating accounts of the genre. Thus, ‘<span>exclusive</span>’ accounts of the western normally include <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Great Train Robbery</em> (1903), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Covered Wagon</em> (1923), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Iron Horse</em> (1924) from the silent years, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stagecoach</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Destry Rides Again</em> (1 939), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Western Union</em> (1941) from the Bazin classical centre of the late 1930s—early 1940s, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Darling Clementine</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Red River</em> (1948), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gunfighter</em> (1 950), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Broken Arrow</em> (1 950), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shane</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rio Bravo</em> (1 959), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ride the High Country</em>/<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Guns in the Afternoon</em> (1962) from later periods. Together these films constitute a canon and frequently figure as reference-points in discussions of the western, establishing the contours of the genre, exemplifying its basic thematic patterns, and defining its iconographical qualities, However, in one sense, the canonic films do not typify the genre. They are drawn mainly from the A feature westerns made by the big studios or by prestigious independents rather than from the modest B pictures and series films which, in quantitative terms, constitute the bulk of the genre. In general, most westerns have come from outside the major studios, apart from certain periods such as 1939— and 1950—3, when almost as many came from the majors as from the independents. There is a sense, then, in which the real core of the genre, at least in statistical terms, lies in the B western, the staple series pictures, the Hopalong Cassidy films, the singing- cowboy pictures, and so on. Pace Bazin, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stagecoach</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Darling Clementine</em>, as well as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shane</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon</em>, only occupy a penumbraic position in the genre and (to continue the spatial metaphor) belong to a periphery.</p>
        <p>Indeed, this bears upon the discussion of norms and deviations which often underpins analyses of the select canon of A features. For it can be argued that the norms, the basic conventions, the ‘<span>pure</span>’ versions of the genre, are really to be found only in the relatively self-contained world of the B western, whilst the A features were much more subject to the need to vary the conventions, to break the generic rules, and to conform, in certain respects, with the prevalent narrative and stylistic norms of the period. As Edward Buscombe has suggested, the ‘<span>A-Western ... was always more of a risk financially; production was more erratic since each film had to sell itself on its merits. For this reason the A-Western was more susceptible to changes in fashion, more influenced by developments in other kinds of films and in Hollywood generally</span>’ (1988: 40—1). Accordingly, in the 1940s westerns such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pursued</em> (1947), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood on the Moon</em> (1948), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Station West</em> (1948), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Colorado Territory</em> (1949), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Furies</em> (1950), amongst others, reflect the Hollywood fashion for introspective psychologically oriented pictures and embody some of the stylistic and narrative features of the film noir. Generic definition, however, is a matter not simply of films themselves but also of the public discursive regimes that mediate between films and the audience and select certain examples for attention and ignore others. As a result, the focus upon the familiar and better-publicized A features—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Darling Clementine</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em>, and so on—is not surprising. These, rather than the singing-cowboy films are the ones discussed by critics and reviewers, analysed by film scholars, and used as the foundation-stones for the canonic edifice known as the western genre, which in turn constitutes the environment in which individual instances of the genre circulate and on which they depend for their currency.</p>
        <p>The inclusive—exclusive distinction has been expressed in another way by David Bordwell, who claims that generic categories are ‘<span>core/periphery schema, with the more "central”members of the category creating a prototype effect</span>’ (1989: 148). While there are problems in using a core—periphery model of genre when it underpins an evaluative, rather than a descriptive, critical approach to genre (as is the case with critics such as Bazin), such a model nevertheless provides an opportunity for capturing the diversity of films traditionally rounded up under the familiar generic categories. Even the most sharply delineated genres include considerable variety, and, as Rick Altman has suggested, there is a ‘<span>need to recognise that not all genre films relate to their genre in the same way or to the same extent</span>’ (1984:6-18). For example, the gangster film embraces both the urban settings of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Scarface</em> (1932) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Little Caesar</em> (1930) and the rural mountain retreats of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Sierra</em> (1941); the musical genre contains both the light touch of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Singing in the Rain</em> and the darker themes of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Star is Born</em> (1954). It is necessary to take account of such diversity in the defining of particular genres, and, indeed, to go further and acknowledge that part of this diversity reflects the hybrid generic qualities of many American films and a fluidity of generic boundaries which is, perhaps, best embodied in the film noir—women’s picture— melodrama <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildred Pierce</em> (1945). It might be suggested that both inclusive and exclusive definitions of individual genres are necessary and both, in their distinctive ways, represent particular aspects of the genre system. The notion of the broad, inclusive corpus alerts us to the extensive skein of relationships that encompass most Hollywood films. Although <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</em> has many of the attributes of the western—it is set in the west, is about pioneers, has horses and guns, and so on—its syntactic structure, which relates romance to community, is characteristic of the musical. Indeed, with its singing and dancing and its focus upon romance, it is probably easier to relate the film to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oklahoma!</em> (1955), another ‘<span>folk-musical</span>’, to use Altman’s (1989) terminology, than to its western contemporaries such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em>. This does not mean that the film is not a western, but rather that it is more likely to Be mentioned in inclusive definitions of the genre (as in encyclopaedias) than in focused discussion; also, it is more likely to be positioned on the periphery of the western while simultaneously occupying a place nearer the core of the musical.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Genre and the individual film</h3>
        <p>The discussion so far has focused upon generic systems and individual genres, abstract conceptual entities generated through a range of discourses and including extrafilmic elements such as advertising, press reviews, journal commentary, television and radio programmes on cinema, and other discourses often referred to as ‘<span>secondary</span>’ or ‘<span>subsidiary</span>’ to the films themselves which, of course, are at the centre of the critical project. The enterprise, in some respects, is one of classification: the construction and definition of generic systems and individual genres, the compilation of inventories of their characteristic subject-matter, themes, iconography, narrative syntax, and visual style. Problems occur, however, if the notion of classification is carried through to the ways in which the concept of genre functions in relation to individual films. This is especially the case when films appear not to settle easily into a category or, to put another way, when a film offers elements which could be claimed by a number of genres, as the example of the ‘<span>western—musical</span>’ or ‘<span>musical—western</span>’ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</em> suggests. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildred Pierce</em>, to take another example, is centred on a woman played by one of the leading female stars (Joan Craw-ford), whose presence signals ‘<span>romantic drama</span>’ (Bourget 1971/1978); the film also begins with a crime, a murder, and has the investigative flashback structure of the noir; a further generic strand (family melodrama) is evoked by the themes of female domesticity versus female career, children versus romantic relationships, from which the tensions surrounding the central character arise. In these cases, clear classification is impossible as both films relate in various ways to more than one genre; and this multigeneric quality is not confined to a few odd or unusual films as ‘<span>nearly all Hollywood’s films were hybrids insofar they tended to combine one type of generic plot, a romance plot, with others</span>’ (Neale 1990: 57)</p>
        <p>If genre criticism were simply matter of constructing taxonomies and allocating films to their places in the system, then the intellectual basis of the exercise would certainly be open to doubt. A shift in emphasis, however, to the activity of <em>reading</em> an individual film in the context of a notion of genre is one way of rethinking the entire concept and moving away from the some-what static idea of genre criticism as taxonomy. Indeed, one of the central critical concerns with the notion of genre could be seen to be its provision of a background aid to the understanding of the individual film. Genre critics, as David Bordwell has suggested, ‘<span>far from being concerned with definition or reasoning from genus to species ... often identify the genre only to aid interpreting the particular work. The identification is transitory and heuristic, like that of nearly all the categories we draw upon in everyday life. Genres, and genre, function as open-ended and corrigible schemata</span>’ (1989: 148).</p>
        <p>Thus, a notion of a particular genre or genres, sometimes accompanied by a sense of generic system, supervises the critical analysis and definition of the individual film. However, the critical work on that film may well rebound on the initial notion of the genre and/or of the generic system, transforming it and drawing attention to the ‘<span>open-endedness</span>’, the transitory status, of genres as conceptual entities. Looked at from this perspective, the notion of genre captures a process in which definitions—the western, the gangster film—are provisional, ‘<span>corrigible schemata</span>’, waiting upon the next instance of the genre which may balance confirmation of existing elements with their transformation, repetition with difference, in various and not entirely predictable ways.</p>
        <p>A return to the individual film and its analysis enables us to find an appropriate role for the system-building, the taxonomic and inventory-oriented activity that characterizes genre criticism. Instead of asking the question ‘<span>To what genre does <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildren Pierce</em> belong?</span>’, it is necessary to probe the consequences of positioning the film in relation to the various genres to which it has a family resemblance, and to think about genre in relation to the process of film comprehension, in relation to what literary theorist Jonathan Culler has called the ‘<span>operations of reading</span>’ (1975: 136). As Culler suggests, the process of reading requires background, context, a general reference-point against which the actual object of reading acquires sense and meaning. For Hollywood films this background is the generic system and its individual genres which constitute a framework for comprehension. The familiar constellation of terms such as ‘<span>convention</span>’, ‘<span>iconography</span>’, ‘<span>horizon of expectation</span>’, ‘<span>audience expectation</span>’ acquires a specific sense in this context deriving from the ‘<span>ideal world</span>’ of the generic system which is constructed through of discourses including, of course, the individual films which make up the individual generic corpus (particularly as it emerges and definitions in exclusive terms are focused on a handful of films thought to be typical and/or regarded as prototypes). The individual viewer confronted with a genre film has already internalized a number of assumptions about the genre system and will have a perception of the ‘<span>world</span>’ implied by each genre with its characteristic iconography, situational conventions, and stock of characters. He or she will read the film against a ‘<span>horizon of expectations</span>’ derived from critical and journalistic discourse in the various media, marketing, and publicity activities, and from the memory of previous viewing of films which are sufficiently similar to act as guides relation to the formation of the horizon of expectation. The notion of each genre evoking a ‘<span>world</span>’, a particular configuration of ‘<span>fictional reality</span>’ with its own rules of behaviour, its particular fictional trajectories, its distinctive visual surface, its overall verisimilitude or structure of plausibility, is useful i regarded as a background mental set which readers of genre cinema bring to the individual film and through which the film sustains at least some of its levels of comprehensibility and maybe its dominant level of comprehensibility.</p>
        <p>Looked at in this light, questions of generic membership—‘<span>To what genre does this film belong?</span>’— become less relevant. Indeed, alternative questions are required such as: ‘<span>What genre or genres constitute an effective and pertinent context for the reading of this film?</span>’ or ‘<span>What is/are the world/worlds invoked by aspects of this film which will enable it to be situated and understood, its narrative trajectory anticipated, its characters to be constructed, and so on?</span>’ If we return to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildred Pierce</em>, we can see that its sense and meaning derive from the ways in which it interweaves different generic strands which are, in many ways, in tension with each other. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildren Pierce</em> is not unique in its multigeneric character and the flexible world of genre identified in the work of Neale and Altman correlates with a flexible approach to the making of genre films in Hollywood itself. This is particularly the case with contemporary, ‘<span>postmodern</span>’ Hollywood and is exemplified in, for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Silence of the Lambs</em> (1991), which combines elements of the police-procedural—the mechanics of detection, a focus on forensic detail— with the horror film.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"> Genre: a summary</h3>
        <p>The impulses behind the development of genre criticism included a sense of unease with traditional critical approaches which highlighted individuality and distinctiveness, and which were centred on the unconventional in film. It was argued, by Lawrence Alloway (1971) in particular, that popular American cinema required a different critical approach from those adopted for the more traditional art forms, an approach which recognized the positive role of formula and convention, stereotypical characterization, familiar narratives, and their centrality to Hollywood picture-making. It was suggested that audiences for Hollywood pictures read them according to a detailed set of assumptions—an intertextual consciousness— derived from a regular viewing of related films and an awareness of the various secondary discourses; and that their pleasures were derived from such qualities as the ritualistic predictability of the narratives and the nuancing of familiar conventions. The unacknowledged assumption was that other forms of cinema were different, non-generic, and subject to different and less restricted modes of reading.</p>
        <p>However, the interplay of semiotics and genre In writers such as Neale and Altman suggests less of a difference between genre films and other forms of cinema at least in terms of the basic processes of communication and reading. All communicative forms, including all films, are underpinned by systems—arguably modelled on language—against which they acquire their significance and meaning. The audience for the films of Michelangelo Antonioni and Ingmar Bergman require a reading-context no less than the audience for the films of John Ford and Sam Peckinpah, and all films have woven into their texture at some level (narrative, style, iconography) signals that indicate the appropriate ways in which they might be understood and appreciated. American genre cinema becomes a special case from this perspective rether than a distinct form, and takes its place in a spectrum of cinematic types.</p>
