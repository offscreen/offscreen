        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">History and Cinema Technology</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Duncan Petrie</h3>
            <p>The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is predicated on machines. Indeed in the early days of the fledgling medium the audience was attracted by the technology rather than the actual material being exhibited. As Stephen Heath notes, ‘what is promoted and sold is the experience of the machine, the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">apparatus</span>”. The Grand Café programme is headed with the announcement of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Cinématographe</span>” and is continued with its description only after that description is there mention of the title of the films to be shown relegated to the bottom of the programme sheet’ (Heath 1980: 1).</p>
        <p>Raymond Williams makes a useful distinction between two categories frequently treated as interchangeable in discussions of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> technology. He defines technical invention as a specific device, developed from practical experience or scientific knowledge and their interaction’. These include pre-<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> devices associated with the development of still photography, and others concerned with the display of moving images including magic lanterns, zoetropes, and other optical entertainments. Such inventions are subsequently selected, improved and developed into a systematic technology of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span>” or “<span class="notranslate" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> </span>” Williams 1983: 12—13). This implies that technology is necessarily directed towards particular goals or uses. Indeed, the interest most film scholars have in technology is very much in how it relates to aesthetic practice.

        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Idealist technological history</h3>
        <p>Since the formative years of film theory, many discussions of technology have been underpinned by an idealist, evolutionary perspective, characterized by a romantic conception of the autonomous individual subject and a teleological view of historical process. Robert Allen and Douglas Gomery (1985) have identified two strands of such evolutionary history. The ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">great man</span>’ theory is grounded upon an assumption of the autonomous agency of human subjects, regarding technological development as dependent upon the activities of a handful of individual inventors and pioneers. This theoretical perspective underpins such pioneering works of film history as Gordon Hendricks’s painstaking investigations (1961, 1964, 1966) into the origins of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in America and John Barnes’s similar endeavours (1976; 1983, 1988, 1 992) in relation to Britain.</p>
        <p>A second evolutionary approach shifts the focus from the creative individual to the technology and its relationship to aesthetic consequences. Raymond Williams describes this approach as involving ‘technological determinism’: ‘new technologies are discovered by an essentially internal process of research and development, which then sets the conditions for social change and progress. The effects of the technologies, whether direct or indirect, foreseen or unforeseen, are, as it were, the rest of history’ (Williams 1974: 13).</p>
        <p>Such an approach informs the work of the technological historian Raymond Fielding, for whom each technological advance contains within it the seeds of subsequent aesthetic uses by filmmakers. Technology sets the parameters and determines the space within which innovative techniques can occur: ‘Just as the painter’s art has changed with the introduction of different media and processes, just as the forms of symphonic music have developed with the appearance of new kinds of instruments, so has the elaboration and refinument of film style followed from the introduction of more sophisticated machinery’ (Fielding 1967).</p>
        <p>But however detailed and compelling as narrative, the shortcomings of such approaches lie in their inabilty to account adequately for why the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> developed at the times, in the places, and in the forms it did; and why certain technologies and techniques were adopted and others rejected in the emergence of the new medium. For example, technological determinism cannot explain why the same basic film technology was utilized for widely divergent kinds of filmmaking in the early days of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, yet by the mid-1910s the narrative feature film had emerged as the dominant form of filmmaking practice.</p>
        <p>The most influential analysis of the development of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> within idealist film theory may be found in the seminal writing of André Bazin. More theoretical than empirical in his project, Bazin locates what he terms ‘the myth of total <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>’ in the minds of the individuals who invented the medium: ‘In their imaginations they saw the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as a total and complete representation of reality; they saw in a trice the reconstruction of a perfect illusion of the outside world in sound, colour and relief’ (Bazin 1967: 20). The evolution of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is viewed as moving towards an ever-increasing verisimilitude, a recreation of the world in its own image, with each subsequent innovation—from still images, to movement, to sound, to colour—marking a more advanced stage in the process. (This was subsequently extended by Charles Barr (1963) to the introduction of widescreen <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>. Processes like <span class="notranslate" translate="no">CinemaScope</span> open out the frame, presenting a greater impression of depth which, following Bazin’s own discussion of deep focus, preserved the essential ambiguity of the real within the image.) This also gives rise to a history based on ‘firsts’ or ‘founding moments’ signposted by such ‘innovations’ as the first ‘projected’ film programmes by the Lumiére brothers in Paris in 1 895; the first ‘talkie’, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Jazz Singer</em>, in 1927 and the first three-colour Technicolor feature, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Becky Sharp</em>, in 1935: and the first <span class="notranslate" translate="no">CinemaScope</span> film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Robe</em>, in 1953. Others might include the first use of Dolby stereo sound, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Star Wars</em>, in 1977, and the first animated feature to be entirely generated by computer, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Toy Story</em>, in 1996.</p>
        <p>The first steps away from evolutionary models of technological development began to emerge in the 1970s. In his examination of the development of deep focus cinematography in Hollywood in the 1940s, Patrick Ogle (1972) challenges conventional understandings which associated this with innovative ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">auteurs</span>’ such as Orson Welles and William Wyler. Drawing upon primary source material, including technical journals such as American cinematographer, he identifies a historical lag between the technical possibility of deep focus and its adoption, a gap accounted for by the resistance of Hollywood cinematographers to deviations from the established visual style of soft tonal qualities and shallow depth of field. Unfortunately Ogle does not offer any explanation as to why Hollywood cameramen were so conservative. Moreover, his assertion of the centrality of cinematographer Gregg Toland in the exploitation of the technical possbility of deep focus in films like The Grapes of Wrath (1940), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Long Voyage Home</em> (1 940), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane</em> (1941) resurrects an idealist perspective by merely shifting the focus from the director to the technician as creative individual.</p>
        <p>Bar Salt’s copious writings on the history of film technology and style (1976, 1982/1992) represent a similar move away from overtly linear models. Salt constructs an avowedly empirical analysis based on deailed examination of primary sources coupled with close viewings of numerous films. Highly critical of deterministic theories, he regards technology as at best a loose pressure on film practice and cites instances where technology can be seen to respond to aesthetic demands such as the trend towards longer shots in 1940s Hollywood, which led to the development of more sophisticated camera dollies. Despite an impressive grasp of historical detail, Salt’s unashamed empiricism, a method he terms ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">scientific realism</span>’, set him increasingly at odds with the major currents of contennporary theoretical development.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Anti-idealist technological history</h3>
        <p>Under the influence of the twin discourses of Marxism and psychoanalysis, film theory in the 1970s began to shift the focus away from idealistic perspectives towards more materially based analyses concerned with the operation of the various factors underpinning and determining the nature of the cinematic process, including the question of technology. The most obvious ‘external’ factor, given the highly capitalistic nature of the film business, was the role of economics. Douglas Gomery’s (1976) analysis of the coming of sound in Hollywood utilizes neo-classical economic theory to explain technological change via a three-stoge model incorporating invention, innovation, and diffusion. The first is dominated by the research and development activities of two corporate giants, the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (AT'n'T) and the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) aimed at developing telephone and radio technology respectively. One side-effect common to both was the perfected capability for sound recording and reproduction. The innovation stage was subsequently driven by the activities of two Hollywood film companies, Warner Bros. and Fox, who adapted the basic technology for practical use in the production and exhibition of sound films. The third and final phase involved the diffusion of such new techniques throughout the industry, with all the other studios embracing sound. At each stage, the overriding concern of the companies concerned was the maximization of long term profitability.</p>
        <p>Edward Buscombe (1977) comments that Gomery’s model is very persuasive, but since it does not explain the need for a particular innovation, it suggests the operation of ideological rather than economic concerns. Buscombe proceeds to apply this theory to the development of colour in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>. According to ‘the myth of total <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>’, colour would appear to signify a greater realism than black and white, the ideology of realism ‘has never been a question of what is real but of what is accepted as real’ (Buscombe 1977: 24). When colour was first introduced it tended to be restricted to ‘unreal’ genres such as cartoons, musicals, fantasies, and comedies, while the more ‘realistic’ genres—crime films, war films, documentaries, and newsreels—were predominantly in black and white. The ideological appeal of colour, it seems, was both as a signifier of spectacle and as a self-conscious celebration of the technology itself. Of course, this cannot be divorced from economic considerations, since the association of colour with particular genres aided Hollywood’s need for product differentiation.</p>
        <p>The role of ideology was given centre-stage even more in subsequent materialist theory. Stephen Heath criticizes historians like Barry Salt for their belief in technology as a self-autonomous instance:</p>
        <p><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinema</span> does not exist in the technological and then become this or that practice in the social; its history is a history of the technological and the social together, a history in which the determinations are not simple but multiple, interacting, in which the ideological is there from the start. (Heath 1980: 6)</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, the influential French Marxist critic Jean-Louis Comolli criticizes perspectives which conside technology to be ideologically neutral by attempting to show how the cinematic apparatus is necessarily rooted in ideology—’the machine is always social before it is technical’. Comolli writes:</p>
        <p>the historical variation of cinematic techniques, their appearance—disappearance, their phases of convergence, their periods of dominance and decline, seem to me to depend not on a rational-linear order of technological perfectibility nor an autonomous instance of scientific ‘progress’ but much rather on the off settings, adjustments, arrangements carried out by a social configuration in order to represent itself, identify itself, and itself produce itself in its, representation. (Comolli 1980: 121)</p>
        <blockquote>This particular mode of representation, which presents itself as ‘natural’ rather than ideologically determined, previously underpinned Renaissance painting and photography and is rooted in the invention of artificial perspective, which centres space around the eye. This in turn designates the perceiving subject as the origin of meaning, and hence transcendentally separated from the material world—the autonomous subject of idealist theory. Comolli may share with Bazin a fascination with the relationship between representation and the real, but he regards ‘realism’ as ideologically constructed, suppressing difference and promoting identity in the interests of the dominant bourgeois order.</blockquote>
        <p>While materialist arguments have proved persuasive, Comolli’s conception of ideology has been criticized as somewhat monolithic, tending towards the abstract and the ahistorical. John Belton suggests that he ‘reduces the complex interaction of various (often conflicting) ideologies to the uniform operation of a single unchanging ideology’ (Belton 1988), while James Spellerberg notes: ‘Dominant ideology is dominant, not total, and the technology as well as the signifying practice of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is created in the field of ideology and is subject to the stresses and contradictions of that field’ (Spellerberg 1977:296).</p>
        <p>The materialist idea of technological development has informed less abstract commentaries such as those of Peter Wollen (1980) and Steve Neale (1985). Wollen stresses both the heterogeneity of technology—citing various examples of the interplay of developments in the fields of mechanics, optics, chemistry, and electronics—and the uneven process of technological development, in which innovations in one area can produce conservatism or even retreat in another. The introduction of sound, for example, created obstacles in the fields of lighting and film stocks, enforced a shift from location to studio filming, altered shooting techniques, and led to the automation of the studio laboratory process.</p>
        <p>John Belton similarly applies a materialist method to his historical analysis of the introduction of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">CinemaScope</span>. He poses the question why, given the invention of the anamorphic Hypergonar lens in the late 1920s, it was further twenty-five years before the introduction of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">CinemaScope</span> as a viable widescreen process His answer is that while technological and ideological determinants existed in the 1920s to support the introduction of anamorphic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, there was no economic interest from either lens manufacturers or the studios. By the 1950s all the economic factors had been reversed, with a declining film industry desperate to find ways to reinvest the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> with new appeal as a spectacle distinct from the experience offered by television. Belton is at pains to note that this is not an instance of a delayed take-up of an already existing technology, as empiricist historians would have it. Rather, recent technical developments in the fields of optics, stock design, colour, sound, and screen fabric were crucial to the emergence of anamorphic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in the 1950s. Ideology also played a part in how the experience of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">CinemaScope</span> was differentiated not only from conventional <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> but also from other new formats such as 3-D and Cinerama.</p>
        <blockquote>Wollen stresses both the heterogeneity of technology—citing various examples of the interplay of developments in the fields of mechanics, optics, chemistry, and electronics—and the uneven process of technological development, in which innovations in one area can produce conservatism or even retreat in another. The introduction of sound, for example, created obstacles in the fields of lighting and film stocks, enforced a shift from location to studio filming, altered shooting techniques, and led to the automation of the studio laboratory process.</blockquote>
        <p>Equally rich in historical data is the consideration by David Bordwell and Janet Staiger of the role of technology within Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, which they regard as ‘a distinct mode of film practice with its own cinematic style and industrial conditions of existence’ (Bordwell and Staiger 1985, p. xiii). Technological development can be explained by the operation of one or more of three basic factors—production efficiency (economy), product differentiation (novelty), and adherence to standards of quality (aesthetic norms)—with the classical Hollywood stylistic paradigm beings constructed in relation to specific ideologies governing narrative, realism. and spectacle. These factors can either complement or collide with one another: for example, change to effect product differentiation may be costly at least in the short run. Differentiation also takes place within defined limits of stylistic standardization.</p>
        <p>Within their analysis, Bordwell and Staiger (1985) identify certain historical agents of change, including institutions such as the manufacturing and supply firms Eastman Kodak, Western Electric, and Bell and Howell and professional associations like the American Society of cinematographers, the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Cumulatively these served to transfer the industry’s economic structures and aesthetic precepts to the spheres of technological innovation and film form, ensuring that the latter developed within the constraints set by the former. For example, the professional associations played a major role in regulating technical change and linking the production sector with the service industries.</p>

        <p>The delights of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">CinemaScope</span> as advertised in publicity for The Ten Commandments (1956)</p>
        <p>Multideterminate approaches also opened up interesting questions of the diffusion of technological development outside Hollywood. Gomery (1980 extends his discussion of the economics of sound technology to the complex process of Europe’s conversion to sound via a consideration of the economic relations between the advanced capitalist countries at the time. Against the historical backdrop of post-Second World War multinational expansion, particularly in the new technological industries such as automobiles and motion pictures, Gomery proceeds to chart a process of economic struggle between the American studios and equipment manufacturers and their European competitors, latter determined to resist the seemingly overwhelming tide of Hollywood imperialism. This struggle resulted in the formation of a loose cartel between Western Electric, RCA, and the mainly German backed conglomerate Tobis-Klanffilm to divide up the world for patent rights. While this cartel was only partially successful, it provides a tangible example of the central role of capitalist expansion and competition in the process of technological diffusion.</p>
        <p>Dudley Andrew (1980) examines a similar process of struggle with regard to the introduction of colour in France after the Second World War. His intentions are to demonstrate the role played by self-conscious (as opposed to invisible) ideological discourse in relation to technological and economic determinants in a particular historical context characterized by suspicion and mistrust. He describes the relevant material circumstances of the time: the hegemony of Technicolor, the (limited) potential of new processes derived from the German Agfacolor system, and the hostility towards America felt in France—particularly in the wake of the Blum—Byrnes accord, which limited the extent to which the French <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> industry could resist Hollywood domination, effectively restricting a regeneration of indigenous production. As it transpired, colour was barely used in French production until the mid-1950s owing to a combination of factors including the influence of contradictory ideological discourses. On the one hand, there was an appreciation of the artistic potential of Technicolor, displayed in some British films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Henry V</em> (1944). But, because of certain technical and economic factors, Technicolor could not meet the increase in demand, and after the failure of indigenous experiments the French industry adopted the Belgian Geva system. At the same time the strategy adopted by the French industry to resist American domination was the pursuit of a ‘quality’ aesthetic which, as Andrew puts it, ‘would unquestionably have preferred the formal and saturated look of to the more casual and documentary look of Agfa processes’ (1980: 73). He concludes that these contradictory discourses of a desire and loathing for American technology served to paralyse the development of colour in France until 1953, when, unsettled by rumours of a new danger posed to their industry by television, French producers began to put up the extra finance necessary for colour production.</p>
        <p>Perhaps one of the major differences between recent historical accounts and earlier writing is a certain degree of self-reflexivity with to theoretical approaches and methods, including the processes of selection and interpretation of data. As Edward Branigan notes, ‘categories arranged in a scheme are not just a way of looking at the world but in some sense determine what we see’ (Branigan 1979: 16). And, as John Belton argues, materialist histories are as prone to this as idealist histories: ‘idealist methodologies will reveal only the essential linearity of history, while materialist methodology will only reveal the essential contradictions and discontinuities that underlie historical change’ (Belton 1988: 23). While this contingency might seem to negate any claims to ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">truth</span>’, it does underline the importance of clarity of purpose and method, of defining terms and categories, and of making the implicit explicit. It has also guided scholars back towards the treasure-trove of historical data, refining our understanding of the complexities of the technologies of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and their use in concrete, historically specific contexts.</p>
