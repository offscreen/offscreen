        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">5 Classical Hollywood film and melodrama</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">E. Ann Kaplan</h3>
        <p>In the first half of the twentieth century the classical Hollywood film was the dominant popular form through which the bourgeoisie increasingly represented itself, its values, and the working classes—to whom <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was earlier largely addressed. This dominant popular form developed out of, and existed alongside, the popular and classical novel and their coroliaries—the melodrama and the ‘<span>well-made</span>’ play—that preceded film and with which it had most affinity (Altman 1992). Indeed, as wil be clear in what follows, Hollywood film becomes the site in which notions of the ‘<span>classical</span>’, developed in relation to drama and the novel as transparent forms reflecting social reality, find themselves in tension with the sensationalism and spectacle of the melodrama.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1977) has argued that theatrical melodrama arose in the late eighteenth century as a form that specifically addressed the new bourgeoisie. As Nowell-Smith puts it, ‘<span>Author, audience and subject matter are put on a place of equality</span>,’ as against the hierarchical relations implied in the earlier epic and tragic forms. ‘<span>Mystified though it may be</span>’, Nowell-Smith notes, ‘<span>the address is from one bourgeois to another bourgeois, and the subject matter is the life of the bourgeoisie</span>’ (Nowell-Smith 1975: 71). The Greek melodrama, while anticipating some of the modes of hysteria and excess of late eighteenth-century melodrama, is situated in a very different relation to its audience. The characters are far from mimicking the lives and status of those watching, retaining their mythic and ritualistic dimensions. It is when the monarchic paradigm is overthrown by democratic urges that, first, the melodrama arises and leads, once the camera is invented, to the Hollywood film.</p>
        <p>Given these origins of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood cinema</span>, about which theorists of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">classical cinema</span> do not basically disagree, it is somewhat paradoxical that such theorists coined the term ‘<span>classical cinema</span>’ in the first place. As will be clear, the term arose because links were forged (somewhat misleadingly) between <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and the classical novel rather than with popular theatre. It is precisely this tension between a paradoxical ‘<span>classical</span>’ (melodramatic) cinematic form and feminist theories of a less ‘<span>classical</span>’, and therefore possibly subversive, melodramatic mode that I explore below.</p>
        <p>Film theorists, then, differ first in their understanding of the ‘<span>classical</span>’ in cinema, and second in the degree to which they are willing to distinguish classicism from the possibly subversive aspects of the sensationalism and spectacle of melodrama. I first outline differing theories of ciassical cinema. I will then show how feminist film theorists interventions in turning to the woman’s melodrama (building on the research of Nowell-Smith, Peter Brooks, and Thomas Elsaesser) unwittingly exposed the limitations and blindnesses of both conceptions of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> outlined earlier. I end by offering a position that seems pertinent to the current moment.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Classical cinema</h3>
        <p>Two main theorizations of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> were developed by film scholars between 1950 and 1980. The first evolved out of French 1950s film criticism—largely through André Bazin, but also, later, through Christian Metz. Bazin’s theories were extended in the 1960s in the context of French left politics and under the influence of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Althusserian Marxism</span>. The resistances of May 1968 and their aftermath also contributed to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinéma</em> positions outlined below, especially in the work of Jean-Louis Comolli and Jean Narboni. British film scholars in and around the journal Screen further developed French theories (e.g. Noel Burch, Stephen Heath, Ben Brewster, and Colin MacCabe). Both the British and the French ideas about classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> became part of American scholars’ research (see Rosen 1986).</p>
        <p>The second conception of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> emerged in reaction to, but still governed by and strangely similar to, these prior theories, mainly through the work on Hollywood narrative by David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, ard Kristin Thompson in the 1980s. These theories have become increasingly influential in the 1990s in the wake of students trained in them. In what follows, I detail briefly the development of these main conceptions of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> from Bazin to Bordwell.</p>
        <p>The concept of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> emerged in France through the influence of André Bazin’s lectures in the 1950s (collected in Bazin 1967, 1971). Particularly in his essay ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Evolution of the Language of Cinema</span>’, Bazin began to outline the prectices of camera-work, editing, and sound that he appreciated in both selected Hollywood and French directors—practices which he claimed as representing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> at its height (or ‘<span>in its essence</span>’). In Bazin’s words, seeing films by William Wylert John Ford, or Marcel Carné, ‘<span>one has the feeling that in them an art has found its perfect balance, its ideal form of expression</span>’ (Bazin 1967:29). The necessary practice of montage, which Bazin believed Soviet and German directors fetishized, must be combined with ‘the sequence of shots “<span>in depth</span>”. Citing particularly the films of William Wyler and Orson Welles as exemplary, Bazin argues that ‘<span>depth of focus brings the spectator into a relation with the image closer to that which he enjoys with reality</span>’ (35). Here, Bazin establishes that narrative coherence and the unity of filmic elements (a kind of classicisan in the sense of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">French neo-classicism of Racine</span>, for example) define the best in Hollywood cinema.</p>
        <p>Although he does not mention the classical novel explicitly, it seems that Bazin has this form in mind as he tries to argue for the kind of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> that represents its ‘<span>highest</span>’ mode. Bazin’s ideas influenced the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinéma</em> collective in the 1960s, but in developing Bazin’s ideas in the context of May 1968, the group moved from the concept of Hollywood’s aesthetic representing cinema’s ‘<span>maturity</span>’ to a focus on the ideological investment underlying the aesthetic forms Bazin had described. Comolli and Narboni’s 1969 <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinéma</em> editorial, which was to shape dramatically Euro-American research on Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in the 1970s, started from the propostion that since films (like books and magazines) are ‘<span>produced and distributed by the capitalist economic system and within the dominant ideology</span>’ then they must ask ‘<span>which films, books and magazines allow the ideology a free, unhampered passage, transmit it with crystal clarity, serve as its chosen language? And which attempt to make it turn back and reflect itself, intercept it, make it visible by revealing its mechanisms, by blocking them?</span>’ (Comolli and Narboni 1969/1989: 23—4). They are not interested in whether or not <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is a high or low form: for them, what is important (and what defines specific Hollywood films) is the class address of its aesthetic forms.</p>
        <blockquote>Bazin establishes that narrative coherence and the unity of filmic elements (a kind of classicism in the sense of the French neo-classicism of Racine, for example) define the best in Hollywood cinema.</blockquote>
        <p>Comolli and Narboni claim that, while ideology says that ‘<span><span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> “<span>reproduces</span>” reality</span>’, in fact this idea of reality is ‘<span>nothing but an expression of the prevailing ideology</span>’. Here they challenge Bazin’s classical notion that the camera ‘<span>is an impartial inxrument which grasps, or rather is impregnated by, the world in its “<span>concrete reality</span>”</span>’ (25). They proceed to distinguish five basically different types of film considered in relation to prevailing ideology. The types range from those completely complicit with prevailing ideology; to those which can be read on two levels, one of which critiques prevailing ideology; to those which take politics as their subject-matter but do not challenge governing cinematic codes; to, finally, those which ‘<span>point out the gap produced between film and ideology by the way the films work, and show how they work</span>’ (28).</p>
        <p>It was this famous formulation that resulted in the pervasive 1970s binary of a ‘<span>classical realist</span>’ and a ‘<span>counter</span>’ <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> perhaps most clearly articulated in Peter Wollen’s essay on Godard’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vent d’est</em> (1902). This in a way Cömbined Bazin’s notion of classicism from classical drama and novel and the ideological schematics of Comolli and Narboni. The ordering and coherence devices of classical Hollywood realism are seen to cover over ideological contradictions and to position the spectator through editing practices within dominant ideology.</p>
        <p>Christian Metz’s bold attempt to establish an over-arching ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">language of film</span>’ with his semiotic model of classical Hollywood (he called it ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">la grande syntagmatique</span>’) was an important attempt to make a science out of filmic narrative patterns (Metz 1974). His in-depth analysis of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Adieu Philippine</em> (1962) provided a model that others—such as Stephen Heath (1975) in his brilliant study of Welles’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Touch of Evil</em> (1958)—strove to follow. In doing so, he revealed how diverse and multifaceted these narratives were. While Metz failed to develop a set of codes that would apply to all films, his schema has been useful in determining how far a film fits, or departs from, classical narrative modes. His work helped in understanding film as a ‘<span>discourse</span>’, and the multiple ways time and space could be ordered in film. But, even within the ‘<span>classical</span>’ group, fitting a film into Metz’s language of film—into the codes he had defined—exposed segments that could not be labelled according to the choices which Metz had described. It was not always clear how charting the film’s narrative segments helped in understanding itsmeanings (but see Stam et al. 1992: 37—56 for positive claims).</p>
        <p>Metz’s (1975) later psychoanalytically based research on the ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Imaginary Signifier</span>’ was influential in introducing subjectivity into theories seeking to establish fixed systems on which Hollywood worked. Metz combined Lacan’s linguistic extensions of Freud’s psychoanalytic theories and his distinction between an ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">imaginary</span>’ and a ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbolic</span>’ psychic arena with Metz’s own semiotics to produce an important application of psychoanalytic theories to film and its reception. His most itnportant contributions here were finding a correspondence Lacan’s mirror phase and the spectator’s identification with the screen; and his distinction of two main kinds of cinematic identification, which he called ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">primary</span>’ and ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">secondary</span>’.</p>
        <p>In Britain and then the United States, the scholar who took up and developed Comolli and Narboni’s ideas in the 1970s was Noel Burch. Burch’s research develcped their notions of five kinds of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> ranging out from the classical to the avant-garde. This had a great impact on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Screen</em> group as well as on the United States burgeoning <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies. However, these scholars, coming as many did out of literary training, returned to Bazin’s implicit linking of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> with the classical novel instead of with the popular melodrama, and to the centrality of realism to the form.</p>
        <p>Colin MacCabe’s (1974) essay ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Realism and Cinema: Notes on Some Brechtian Theses</span>’ is a case in point. The essay succinctly summarized and furthered many of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> ideas, only now with specific reference to the classical novel, to Brechtian theatre , and Rossellini films. MacCabe shares with Bazin the idea that classical Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> relies on realism, but he is concerned to show that this is only one construction of a ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">real</span>’, not the reality that Bazin claimed <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> could capture. For MacCabe, ‘<span>The detour through literature is necessary because, in many ways, the structure is much more obvious there and also because of the historical dominance of the classic realist novel over much film production</span>’ (1974:8). MacCabe argues that classical realism is characterized by a hierarchy of discourses ‘<span>defined in terms of an empirical notion of truth</span>’, which means that the ‘<span>metalanguage is not regarded as material: it is dematerialised to achieve perfect representat on—to let the identity of things shine through the window of words</span>’ (8). As will be clear below, the conception of ‘<span>classical cinema</span>’ produced from this analogy was ultimately insufficient to account for the complex traditions on which ‘<span>classical</span>’ <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> actually relied.</p>
        <p>Noel Burch’s 1979 film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Correction, Please!</em> provided an amusing and informative demonstration of how Hollywood’s classical narrative style was historically produced as a method for engaging the spectator’s identification and permitting the evolution of a profitable film production system not that different from factory modes of production. His film cleverly satirized Hollywood realism and suggested strategies for reversing and revealing its ideological codes.</p>
        <p>It is important that this post-Bazin notion of the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was primarily ideological. It was designed to show how the Hollywood system worked to produce its formidable realist illusionism with its individualist, materialist, and inherently capitalist ideology, repeated from genre to genre through the repetition of similar cinematic codes and conventions.</p>
        <blockquote>This post-Bazin notion of the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> wes primarily ideological.

        <p>While the broad outlines of the first conception of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as an ideological institution that serves specific class needs and whose values never stray far from mainstream US perspectives still seems valid, clearly there were problems with the rigidity of some formulations and with the absence of empirical research to back up broad claims about the ideological construction of the classical cinema. In much of the discussion, ‘<span>Hollywood</span>’ is both essentialized and homogenized and analysed with insufficient historical specificity.</p>
        <p>It is precisely such lacks that David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson began (and continue) to address, attacking certain broad claims made by ideological scholars of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> through the accumulation of data on Hollywood and other films from the silent era onwards (Bordwell et al. 1985). Like Metz’s ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">language of cinema</span>’, what has become known as ‘<span>the Wisconsin project</span>’ aims to return <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> analysis to ‘<span>science</span>’ and away from thematic modes, although their method differs from that of Metz. They refuse the psychoanalytic argument about an ideological appeal to an unconscious and pursue a cognitive psychology approach. Viewers are seen as predisposed to look for the cues a film’s narrative provides, and then to organize the sensory data into patterns for processing information already available to the viewers. The method was first worked out in relation to early Soviet directors and Carl Dreyer’s films, as well as with Japanese cinema. A ‘<span>hypothetical entity</span>’, the viewer ‘<span>executes operations based on inferences and assumptions to generate the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fabula</em> from the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">syuzhet</em>, which provides cues as to the order, frequency, and duration of events</span>’ (Nichols 1992: 59). For Bordwell, ‘<span>the classical Hollywood film ... presents psychologically defined individuals as its principal causal agents, struggling to solve a clear-cut problem or to attain specific goals, the story ending either with a resolution of the problem, or a clear achievement or non-achievement of the goals. Causality revolving around character provides the prime unifying principle, while spatial configurations are motivated by realism as well as compositional necessity</span>’ (Stam et al. 1992: 189). Bill Nichols notes the many strengths of Bordwell’s analysis of narrational process, including ‘<span>its supple blend of theory, criticism and, to a more limited extent, history</span>’ (Nichols 1992: 55).</p>
        <p>But ironically the structure of Bordwell’s overall system is not so dissimilar from that of the ideological notion of classical cinema: Bordwell’s formalism results in a highly condensed and somewhat mechanical theory in which he isolates in all texts a ‘<span>dominant</span>’ to which all other elements are subordinated (Altman 1992). However, for Bordwell, this structure emerged for reasons of narrative coherence rather than (as with MacCabe) to impose as ‘<span>truth</span>’ a limited and class-based concept of reality. Bordwell, Staiger, and Thompson (1985) offer empirical studies to support claims <em class="notranslate" translate="no">vis-å-vis</em> how film narrative evolved historically, and show that things were in fact more varied and less ideologically driven by bourgeois economic motives than the French-influenced proponents of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> had argued.</p>
        <p>I do not here aim to debate in depth the relative merits of these two broad positions on classical cinema—positions that remain pretty much in circulation and that, as indicated, strangely mimic each other in their would-be scientism and would-be ‘<span>objectivity</span>’. While I value the empirical research of scholars like Bordwell, I am not convinced by the substitution of a ‘<span>formalist poetics</span>’ for a governing system of ideology (see <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Film Criticism</em> 1993, esp. Kaplan 1993, Wood 1993). Bordwell’s poetics usefully involves close attention to the surface of a film, which means giving perception a bigger role and attending carefully to any one film’s unique functions and effects. Important also is the detailed attention to historical development in analysing film narrative. But this begs the question of what Bordwell, Staiger, and Thompson mean by ‘<span>history</span>’ just as the question was begged by the ideological group. As Nichols points out, Bordwell’s notion of history is very limited, not including reference to television, the other arts, or to non-Western films. Further, while Bordwell claims that feminist analyses and concern with minority discourse in film are simply new ideological orientations, telling us nothing about a film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">per se</em>, I would note that there cannot be a ‘<span>poetics of film</span>’ which is not already deeply implicated in Western issues of race and gender. Bordwell’s ‘<span>science</span>’ excludes feminist theory and also, as Nichols notes, ‘<span>regards the viewer as a sexless, genderless, classless, stateless “<span>hypothetical entity</span>”</span>’ (Nichols 1992: 64). Only cyborgs—that is, imaginary entities that combine human and machine—Nichols ironically concludes, fit the kind of decoder of cues, or executer of operations bat Bordwell’s poetics requires.</p>
        <p>Thus, we have the irony of a similarity between Bordwell’s position and that of Comolli and Narboni. Both claim to outline a specific classical system, but their concerns with the system are quite opposite: the French position focuses on cinema’s ideological inscription, Bordwell’s on the way it functions cognitively to transfer meaning regarding narrative codes and plots. He is not interested in any film’s ideology; the French are not interested in any film’s ‘<span>poetics</span>’. And neither can deal with historically positioned subjects for whom much is at stake in cinematic identification.</p>
        <p>Both these conceptions of the ‘<span>classical</span>’ minimize, if they do not ignore, the other powerful influences—those of popular stage melodrama and consumer culture—feeding the developments in Hollywood and producing the film industry as a site of tension and contradictions. In regard to the melodramatic aspects of sensationalism and the spectacle, the invention of film at the turn of the century was part of a crucial change taking place in the late nineteenth century with the advent of modern consumer culture and advertising. As Allon White has argued, this change ‘<span>involved the displacement of pleasure into the realm of the signifier (form, style, association) and its dissociation from the “<span>real</span>” world of work and dreary production</span>’. White notes that this ‘<span>dissociation was a necessary correlative to the unfettering of commodity-centered, consumer capitalism</span>’ and that ‘<span>the creaming off of the signifier from the signified marked a new phase in the production of Western subjectivity in its long march from Feudalism to a bureaucratic society of controlled consumption</span>’ White 1983).</p>
        <p>Consumer culture hooks onto the subject’s inevitable desiring mode, re-enforcing and exploiting it by constant stimulation. Beginning with the department store and the stage melodrama, the culture of the spectacle is fully inscribed in society with the development of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as an apparatus. Film becomes the form that replaces the popular theatre melodrama in the way it addresses desires invoked by the new consumer culture and, while the popular stage melodrama continues, it is also affected by the culture of the spectacle. The popular novel begins to use description in a self-consciously ‘<span>cinematic</span>’ style, while some theatre leaves spectacle to the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and becomes minimalist.</p>
        <p>Film’s mode as spectacle dovetails with modes of consumer culture in a circular fashion. That is, film emerges at a certain stage of consumer culture, its modes increasing consumerism and encouraging upward class-striving through accumulation of consumer products. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> stimulates new desires and signifying of status through objects. With the invention of cinema, a new self-consciousness is built into the subject’s constitution. If Lacan’s mirror phase had always been a necessary part of the subject’s entry into the Symbolic, it now becomes an inherent part of cultural experience. The other self offered by the mirror becomes part of society’s cultural mechanisms, transforming the subject’s ways of perceiving and desiring.</p>
        <p>Many of the theories of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> I have outlined tended to omit these aspects of sensationalism and spectacle, along with attention to the subject in general, let alone the subject as gendered. Paradoxically, the new culture of the spectacle (mainly used to reinscribe oppressive female modes) as it emerged in women’s melodrama could be used to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">destabilize</em> and subvert the unifying and ordering aspects of classicism, especially <em class="notranslate" translate="no">vis-å-vis</em> the female subject, the female spectator.</p>
        <blockquote>Paradoxically, the new culture of the spectacle (mainly used to reinscribe oppressive female modes) as it emerged in women’s melodrama could be used to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">destabilize</em> and subvert the unifying and ordering aspects of classicism, especially vis-å-vis the female subject, the female spectator.</blockquote>
        <p>Male theorists of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> basically had in mind a male spectator and male unconscious processes. While still working within the limits of French male theory of the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (and not vet theorizing women’s melodrama), Laura Mulvey’s well-known 1975 essay ‘<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</span>’ set up the terms for the first round of feminist discussion of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in illuminating how that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> basically was constructed for the male spectator which theorists had assumed without question. Constructing a model of the cinematic gaze as it embodied Freud’s twin mechanisms of voyeurism and fetishism, Mulvey showed how, in classical cinema, woman was situated as bearer of meaning rather than maker of meaning (see Creed and White, Part, Chapters 9 and 13 for an exposition of this argurrjent). This insight about the main classical male genres led Mulvey to claim that Hollywood could not offer anything to women, and that women must free the camera from its realist oppressions.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Melodrama</h3>
        <p>It was in response to Mulvey’s essay and in an effort to see what Hollywood might offer women that feminist film theorists turned to study the melodrama form that explicitly addresses woman, that is, to what has been called ‘<span>the weepie</span>’ or ‘<span>the woman’s film</span>’. The most constructive and challenging work on the classical cinema, then, emerged almost by default in this new attention to the women’s melodrama form. The 1970s concept of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is qualified in this research, or repositioned in different ways depending on theorists concerns. ln critiquing the male bias of classical film theory, feminist film theorists (perhaps unintentionally) opened classical film up to far different perspectives, issues, and concerns.</p>
        <p>Earlier (largely male) historians and literary theorists had been concerned to chart the history of melodrama as a specific theatre and film genre. Peter Brooks (1972) and Thomas Elsaesser (1972) expanded the concept of melodrama beyond the confines of a specific theatrical genre to focus on a generalized type of aesthetic experience that produces specific emotional effects in the spectator. Brooks’s main thesis is that melodrama is a response to the ‘<span>loss of tragic vision</span>’ exacerbated by the Industrial Revolution and the creation of a society deprived of an organic and hierarchical order. The ensuing solidification of the bourgeois class, with its specific form of nuclear family, was accompanied by an ethical vacuum in the public sphere. Melodrama, then, is a type of sense-making characterized by ‘<span>indulgence of strong emotionalism; moral polarization and schematization; extreme slates of being, situations, actions; overt villainy, persecution of the good and final reward of virtue; inflated and extravagant expression; dark plottings, suspense, breathtaking peripety</span>’ (Brooks 1976:4).</p>
        <p>If one accepts Peter Brooks’s general definition of the melodramatic, then all the main Hollywood genres are melodrama in attempting an ethical recentring, a ‘<span>search for a new plenitude in reaction to the decentering of modern consciousness</span>’ (Brooks 1976). This produces some confusion in relation to theories of the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> wich originally did not <em class="notranslate" translate="no">per se</em> include the term ‘<span>melodrama</span>’, nor distinguish amongst the main forms of Hollywood genres within an overall category of ‘<span>melodrama</span>’.</p>
        <p>A further distinction needs to be made between the melodrama form (including those addressed to male spectators) and the Bazinian and Bordwellian concepts of the ‘<span>classical</span>’. For, as Brooks and Elsaesser had already pointed out, melodrama conventions often disrupt or work against the ordering and unifying tendencies which the concept of the ‘<span>classical</span>’ implies. In Rick Altman’s words, melodrama permits excess not to be positioned outside the system but to have a system of its own—a system that complicates and puts pressure on the dominant (Altman 1992: 34). But the early male critics engaged in this work focused more on broadly defined bourgeois ideology about the family in general than on the films specifically female address.</p>
        <p>But it was feminist film critics who discovered a need to distinguish the films specifically geared for female audiences (women’s melodramas) from those aimed at both male and female spectators generally. Films focused on in this research include the series of films made from the notorious stage melodrama <em class="notranslate" translate="no">East Lynne</em> (see Kaplan 1992); King Vidor’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stella Dallas</em> (1937); the two versions of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Imitation of Life</em> (Jonathan Stahl, 1934, Douglas Sirk, 1959); and Dorothy Arzner’s films, The focus on women’s melodrama—as against the implicit category of melodrama for all Hollywood films—included giving attention to film and television melodrama forms seen as explicitly addressing female spectators, and as dealing with issues pertinent to women. There is, then, a ‘<span>politics</span>’ of melodrama structures that feminist theorists exposed and (sometimes building on work by Stephen Heath) linked to the psychoanalytic processes at work in melodrama. The fact that melodrama is the genre which, in its recent form, arises with modernization—that is, at the intersection of absolutist (or premodern) social forms and later specifically capitalist forms—makes it particularly pertinent to the study of maternal (and other) images in the modern period (Kaplan 1992: 21—6). For feminists, melodramas open space prohibited by the so-called classical realist film text, which is restricted to oppressive patriarchal norms.</p>
        <blockquote>For feminists, melodramas open space prohibited by the so-called classical realist film text, which is restricted to oppressive patriarchal norms.</blockquote>
        <p>In remedying the gap in male discussion of melodrama, feminist critics brought renewed interest in melodrama, and asked new questions of the form while building on Brooks’s and Elsaesser’s theories. In a first wave of work, critics like Laura Mulvey (who saw the possibilities of the woman’s film) and Mary Ann Doane (to take two important examples) began to explore the important difference between films addressed to a male and to a female spectator. Mulvey, writing in 1977, defined the family melodrama as explicitly a form with female address, one that deliberately functioned to counter-balance the dominant male genres. For her, ‘<span>a dramatic rendering of women’s frustrations, publicly acting out an adjustment of balance in the male ego is socially and ideologically benefical</span>’ (1977/1989: 40). But she goes on to assume that the melodrama involves ‘<span>reaffirmation of the Oedipus complex</span>’. That is, although in the family melodrama ‘<span>(the phallocentric, castration-based, more misogynist fantasies of patriarchal culture</span>’ are ‘<span>sacrificed in the interest of civilization</span>’, Mulvey reads ‘<span>civilization</span>’ in terms of how man comes to be man. Adapting Freud and Kristeva, for Mulvey ‘<span>civilization</span>’ is produced through male rejection of the mother, and the insistence on the mother’s serving patriarchy. Nevertheless. Mulvey finds something important for women in these films about female victims. First, the mother may try to keep her son with her, clown in the Imaginary and in this way resist the mother’s position as a patriarchal function. As Mulvey puts it: ‘<span>In the absence of any coherent culture of oppression, the simple fact of recognition has aesthetic importance: there is a dizzy satisfaction in witnessing the way that sexual difference under patriarchy is fraught, explosive, and erupts dramatically into violence within its own stomping ground, the family</span>’ (39).</p>
        <p>Building on this work, Mary Ann Doane has shown that most women’s films construct a heroine who is a victim entailing a masochistic identification for the female viewer. These repeated masochistic scenarios effectively immobilize the female spectator, refusing her the imaginary identification which in the male forms produces a sense of mastery and control.</p>
        <p>Mary Ann Doane’s work has been central in theorizing the female spectator in the woman’s film. In a 1984 essay, she uses Freud’s work on femininity 10 build on Mulvey’s essay, arguing that woman is constructed differently in relation to the processes of looking (Doane 1984). Doane goes to French feminist theory to show woman cannot assume the fetishistic position because ‘<span>the lack of distance between seeing and understanding, the mode of judging</span>’ “<span>in a flash</span>” (a reference to Freud’s theory of the girl’s sudden reaction to seeing the penis for the first time) is conducive to might be termed as “<span>over identification</span>” with the image (69).</p>
        <p>Doane views this over-identification with the image as necessarily entailing a passive, masochistic position because of the position woman is assigned in cinematic narrative. On the other hand, woman may also identify with the active hero, in which case, as Mulvey had already argued, woman took up a masculine spectator position. Doane moves from here to discussion of woman’s more natural transvestism resulting from her apparently greater inherent bisexuality. As Juliet Mitchell has noted (in contrast to some recent feminist Freudian revisionists), male sexual identity is more sure than feminine identity because of the greater compulsion (via the castration complex) to turn away from the first feminine identification with the mother. While the girl also must reject this early feminine identification (as Mitchell put it, the shadow of the phallus falls over the girl’s ego as also over the boy’s, creating a masculine ‘<span>I</span>’ born out of the baby’s desiring what the mother desires), this identification, albeit much reduced, nevertheless remains. The girl is then more naturally bisexual than the boy, slipping easily over into masculine identification.</p>
        <p>But for Doane this transvestism is not recuperable, and woman is left with only two alternatives: the masochism of over-identification or the narcissism entailed in becoming one’s own object of desire (Doane 1987: 18-22). A third possibility, that of the masquerade (i.e. exaggerating the accoutrements of the patriarchal feminine in order to create a distance from the image, to reveal femininity as precisely a mask covering a non-identity and thus to disrupt patriarchal systems), is not really a solution. But in this later work, Doane sees possibilities of dislocating the position assigned woman through understanding the various spectatorship places (176—83).</p>
        <p>Doane’s formulation tends to generalize the mechanisms she explores to the entire genre of the woman’s film, including its subgroupings. Elsewhere, I have differentiated those films addressing women that involve such despecularization of the female spectator from others which function to allow the female spectator certain kinds of pleasure in the struggle to resist patriarchal definitions and positionings (Kaplan 1992). Another problem with psychoanalytic film theory in general, pointed out by Teresa de Lauretis, is the focus on the gaze—on woman as spectacle, to the detriment of considering types of identification other than with the camera. De Lauretis (1985) argues that narrative identificationn and closure are equally important and may afford the female spectator more space. These arguments gain force through linking the woman’s melodrama to the nineteenth-century popular woman’s novel, since obviously issues of the gaze are less central in fiction.</p>
        <p>In a second wave of work on the family melodrama, critics like Linda Williams (1964) and Tania Modleski (1983) (to take again just two examples) have used spectatorship theory to argue that women are not merely offered identification with victims in these films. Referring to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stella Dallas</em>, for example, Williams showed that female victims are situated in relation to other female figures with whom the female spectator identifies as well and that, out of this multiple and shifting series of identifications, the spectator learns about victimization, about woman’s deprivations, and glimpses other female ways of being Williams 1984), while Modleski’s (1993) study of Hitchcock argued that they included female address. Stimulating debates followed these interventions (Kaplan 1985a, b, 1986).</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Mulvey’s early work exposed the oppressive aspects of the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> outlined for women, but did not critique the theory per se. It offered an understanding of the sexist bias of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> without questioning its premises. But the study of melodrama and the address of the genre of the woman’s film as summarized above did implicitly begin to critique the male asumptions and obsessions of prior formulations of classical cinema. Feminist film criticism of women’s melodramas thus opened up new avenues of discusion <em class="notranslate" translate="no">vis-å-vis</em> classical cinema. It complicated the rigid totalizing tendencies in both conceptions of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> with which I began. It allowed for multiple identifications, not just a blind adherence to a proposed ‘<span>dominant</span>’ (Bordwell et al. 1985: 41—84) or a capitalist bourgeois ideology (Burch 1969; Comolli and Narboni 1989).</p>
        <p>Certainly, the overall values that Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> still promotes are those of individualism, materialism, heterosexuality (despite the increasing interest in gay and lesbian couples and issues), and the nuclear family. And it promotes these values through a specific set of cinematic codes, prime among which is illusory realism. Hollywood illusionism masks the actual operations of power and patriarchal hierarchies. As long as it does this, it is an ideological <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> whose strategies promote unconscious identification with protagonists through appeals aims.</p>
        <p>Yet the breakdown of the Hollywood studio system has allowed variations of the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> so become more mainstream. Arguably, since 1960 the large Hollywood studios that provided the institutional basis for the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> that film theorists named ‘<span>classical</span>’ have become less monolithic and, in the course of this process, the distribution and exhibition systems have changed significantly If the needs of the American middle classes continue to find expression in Hollywood film even today, it is in a form modified to fit existing social formations.</p>
