            <p>But even if Aldous Huxley’s nightmare should come true and the experiences of taste, smell and touch should be added to those of sight and hearing, even then we may say with the Apostle, as we have said when first confronted with the sound track and the technicolor film, “We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair.”</p>
            <p>—Erwin Panofsky, “Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures”</p>
            <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">1. Futureworld</h3>
            <p>Films entertain and move us, but they also move us to thought. Imagine you are a young sociologist working around 1907. In the course of a year or two, on your daily ride to the university you witness an explosion of “nickelodeons” along the trolley route. They seem to operate continuously, day and night, and it is rare not to see a queue outside their doors. Because your children spend an extravagant amount of time and money unsupervised within their walls, and exhibit an extraordinary and sometimes incomprehensible fascination with the characters presented there and the people who play them, perhaps you yourself have gone inside to see a “photoplay” or two? How would it be possible to comprehend, despite the breadth and depth of your knowledge, that an entirely new medium and an important industry were being created which, in many respects, would define the visual culture of the twentieth century?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup></p>
            <p>This is how I respond when friends and colleagues ask why my critical attention has turned to “new media” and digital culture in recent years. My hypothetical social theorist may have been fortunate enough to participate in early studies of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and radio as mass cultural phenomena. In retirement, this imaginary scholar’s interest may again have been piqued by the emergence of television. But the question remains: how would it be possible to imagine in 1907 what<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> would become in the course of the fifty years that followed? Or to imagine in 1947 what television would become in just ten or fifteen years? As the twentieth century unfolded, technological, economic, and cultural changes took place on the scale of a lifetime. This was already incomprehensibly fast from the perspective of the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. Now, at the edge of the twenty-first century, these same changes are taking place in less than a generation.</p>
            <p>The rapid emergence of new media as an industry and perhaps an art raises a more perilous question for<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies. The twentieth century was unquestionably the century of cinema, but is cinema’s time now over? And if so, what is to become of its barely matured field,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies?</p>
            <p>Despite my interest in new technologies and the new media, I have never given up, and indeed still insist on my identity as a “film theorist,”much to the confusion of my family and the amusement of taxi drivers the world over. If feeling more self-important, I’ll say that my principal interests are philosophy and contemporary visual culture, with<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as the decisively central element of study. Now, even in<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies itself this could be considered a marginal position. Film theory has fallen on hard times, even within the field of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies itself. In the 1970s and early 1980s, many identified the field entirely with film theory, especially its Franco-British incarnation represented by the journal <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Screen</em>and its importation from France of the work of Christian Metz, Roland Barthes, and others.More currently, research in film history has for many, and with brilliant results, dominated the field. In addition, many of the questions film theory raised in the heady days of political modernism concerning representation, ideology, subjectivity, and so on have evolved in the direction of cultural studies and media theory with their more sociological orientation. Thus, through the 1980s and 1990s one of the recurrent debates in the Society for<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> Studies was how to represent the growing interest in television and electronic media. Was<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies disappearing, and was film becoming less central? This was a hard pill to swallow for the prevideo cinephile generation of which I am a card-carrying member. Not only do many feel that film theory is much less central to the identity of the field; within<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies itself the disappearance of “film” as a clearly defined aesthetic object anchoring our young discipline is also the cause of some anxiety. Indeed, as of December 2002 the organization became the Society for<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and Media Studies, reflecting the apparent displacement of film and the enlargement of the organization to something like moving image or screen studies.</p>
            <p>So what becomes of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies if film should disappear? Perhaps this is a question that only film theory can answer.</p>
            <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">2. The Incredible Shrinking Medium</h3>
            <p>In May 1999, I took advantage of a bachelor weekend in New York to make the rounds of the new summer movies. Something was clearly afoot. Released earlier that spring, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Matrix</em>was dominating the screens. As I settled in to watch previews at a large downtown cineplex, I noticed that nearly every big summer film was following its lead. This was the summer of digital paranoia. In a trend that began with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dark City</em>the year before, films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Matrix, Thirteenth Floor,</em>and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eXistenZ</em>each played with the idea that a digitally created<em class="notranslate" translate="no"></em>simulation could invisibly and seamlessly replace the solid, messy, analog world of our everyday life. Technology had effectively become nature, wholly replacing our complex and chaotic world—too “smelly” according to the lead Agent in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Matrix</em>—with an imaginary simulation in which social control was nearly complete. (A welcome antidote was Abel Ferrara’s resolutely nobudget version of William Gibson’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New Rose Hotel,</em>which recast the Hollywood version of cyberpunk as a low-tech political chamber play whose message was that the future is already here and living in industrial New Jersey.) The digital versus the analog was the heart of narrative conflict in these films, as if<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> were fighting for its very aesthetic existence. The replacement of the analog world by a digital simulation functions here as an allegorical conflict wherein<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> struggles to reassert or redefine its identity in the face of a new representational technology that threatens to overwhelm it. The implicit and explicit references to computer gaming in these films are also significant and premonitory.</p>
            <p>This conflict, of course, is entirely disingenuous for reasons that are both economic and aesthetic.<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> had been down this road before. In response to the explosive growth of television in the 1950s, for example,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> represented itself as a spectacular artistic and democratic medium in contradistinction to television, whose diminutive image belied its potentially demagogic power. In actuality, many players in the film industry had already prepared their Faustian bargains with the broadcast industries and their competing technologies, and the same is no less true today.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a2"><a href="#fn:a2">2</a></sup> Though sincerely felt by some directors and writers, this battle of the media giants was something of a marketing ploy to maintain an idea of cinema’s status as a prestige experience and as an “Art.” As television took on the role of a mass, popular medium,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> reserved for itself, at least in the world of product differentiation, the image of an “aesthetic” experience.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a3"><a href="#fn:a3">3</a></sup></p>
            <p>This conflict between new and old technologies also has aesthetic precedents in the history of Hollywood cinema. The staging of the digital as simulation functions in the same way as the narrative dream or fantasy in the classic Hollywood musical. By striking an opposition of imaginary and real as two different narrative registers represented within the same film, Hollywood narrative, even in its most outlandish form, asserts all the more stridently its status as “reality.” This is a classic case of Freudian <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Verneinung.</em>When this strategy occurs as a narrative representation of technology, it is always a contest between competing versions of the “real” dissembling the fact that each is equally imaginary. Narrative conflict with the digital reasserts the aesthetic value of analog images as somehow more real than digital simulations, not only at the<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> but also in computer gaming and other new media. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Matrix</em>is a marvelous example of how Hollywood has always responded ideologically to the appearance of new technologies. Incorporated into the film at the levels of both its technology of representation and its narrative structure, the new arrival is simultaneously demonized and deified, a strategy that lends itself well to marketing and spectacle. In terms of market differentiation, computer- generated imagery codes itself as contemporary, spectacular, and futureoriented; a sign of the new to bolster sagging audience numbers. At the same time, the photographic basis of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is coded as “real,” the locus of a truthful representation and the authentic aesthetic experience of cinema. Photography becomes the sign of the vanishing referent, which is a way of camouflaging its own imaginary status. So, in the canny conclusion of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Matrix</em>we enjoy both the apotheosis of Neo, the digital superhero, and the preservation of the last human city, Zion, a distant utopia hidden away at the Earth’s core that functions as the site of the “real.”</p>
            <p>This allegorical conflict between the digital and the analog also provides a new opportunity for forging an opposition between technology and art. Perhaps the oldest criticism in the history of film theory is that film and photography could not be art because they were technology: an automatic inscription of images without the intervention of a human hand. Through the narrative inscription of technology as the antithesis of art, in which a representation of the photographic process now becomes the signifier,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> reclaims for itself the grounds of “humanistic” expression.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a4"><a href="#fn:a4">4</a></sup> This claim is also not new. It is already clearly present in silent<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> but is now narrativized in a new way to give new life to an old concept.</p>
            <p>There is yet one more ironic twist to the logic of digital paranoia in fin-desiècle cinema. As I took in previews for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Mummy</em>and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Phantom Menace,</em>it was clear to me that at the level of representational technologies, the digital had in fact <em class="notranslate" translate="no">already</em>supplanted the analog. Feature films comprised entirely of computer-generated images such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Toy Story</em>(1995) or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Bug’s Life</em>(1998) were not harbingers of a future world, but rather <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the</em>world of cinematic media as experienced today. Computer-generated images are no longer restricted to isolated special effects; they comprise in many sequences the whole of the mise-en-scène to the point where even major characters are in whole or in part computer-generated. In fact, technological transformations of the film actor’s body in contemporary<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> are indicative of a sea change that is now nearly complete. One could say that the body of the film actor has always been reworked technologically through the use of special makeup, lighting, filters, editing, and so on. Contemporary cinema, however, is taking this process to new levels. One of the many fascinating elements of digital<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is not just the thematic idea of cyborg fusions of technology and the body. Digital processes are increasingly used actually to efface and in some cases entirely to rewrite the actor’s body. Film “actors” have become Frankenstein hybrids: part human, part synthetic. This strategy first came to popular attention in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Terminator 2</em>(1991), but newer films have taken the process even farther. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Mummy,</em>Im-Ho-Tep is a constantly mutating digital construction that has more screen time than Arnold Vosloo, the actor who plays him in the live-action sequences; in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Phantom Menace,</em>the annoying Jar Jar Binks lacks only a synthesized voice to make him an entirely computer-generated creation. Cyberware, a Monterey, California, company that specializes in threedimensional scanning and digitization of actors, assures that Arnold Schwartzeneger will have a career as a “synthespian” long after he has retired or passed on to the Chateau Marmont in the sky. The digital Agents have already won, it would seem, but they continue to play out the conflict to delay our recognition of the fact. They are even savvy enough to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">act</em>as if they’ve lost, the better to preserve our sleep, which feeds energy to the system.</p>
            <p>The reworking of the actor’s body by technological processes is not something entirely new. Yet something is changing. The gradual replacement of the actor’s recorded physical presence by computer-generated imagery signals a process of substitution that is occurring across the film industry. The successive stages of the history of this substitution might look something like this.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a5"><a href="#fn:a5">5</a></sup></p>
            <p>• 1979: Lucasfilm, Ltd., establishes a computer animation research division to develop special effects for motion pictures.</p>
            <p>• 1980s: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Digital image processing and synthesis</em>become increasingly prevalent in television advertising and music video production. Steven Jobs’s Pixar and George Lucas’ Industrial Light and Magic emerge as the most innovative producers of digital imaging for motion pictures.</p>
            <p>• Late 1980s: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Digital nonlinear editing systems</em>begin rapidly replacing the mechanical Steenbeck and Moviola tables as the industry editing standard. From 1995 they begin to be perceived as a universal standard.</p>
            <p>• Late 1980s: successful trials of digital cameras with resolution approximating that of 35mm film.</p>
            <p>• In 1989, James Cameron’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Abyss</em>produces the first convincing <em class="notranslate" translate="no">digitally animated character</em>in a live-action film—the “pseudopod.” The experiment is raised to a new level in 1991 with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Terminator 2</em>’s use of a character that morphs continually between human actors and computergenerated images, the T-1000 terminator.</p>
            <p>• 1990: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Digital sound</em>is introduced with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dick Tracy</em>and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Edward Scissorhands.</em>By the end of 1994 most studios are releasing prints with digital soundtracks.</p>
            <p>• 1993: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jurassic Park</em>makes prevalent and popular the possibility of generating <em class="notranslate" translate="no">“photographically” believable synthesized images.</em>This trend continues with increasing success throughout the 1990s.</p>
            <p>• 1995: Pixar releases the first fully <em class="notranslate" translate="no">synthetic feature film, Toy Story.</em>• 1998–2001: Increasing popularity of digital video cameras, whose use for fiction films is popularized in films of the Dogma movement, such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Festen</em>(1998) and Mike Figgis’ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Time Code</em>(2000).</p>
            <p>• 1998: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pleasantville</em>and then <em class="notranslate" translate="no">O Brother Where Art Thou?</em>(2000) are among the first films whose negatives are digitized for treatment in postproduction. By 2004, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">digital intermediates</em>are becoming standard practice.</p>
            <p>• June–July 1999: Successful test screenings in New Jersey and Los Angeles of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace</em>using <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fully electronic and digital projection</em>.</p>
            <p>• June 2000: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Digital projection and distribution</em>come together as Twentieth Century–Fox and Cisco Systems collaborate in transmitting a feature film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Titan A.E.,</em>over the Internet and then projecting it digitally in an Atlanta movie theater.</p>
            <p>The next ten years may witness the almost complete disappearance of celluloid film stock as a recording, distribution, and exhibition medium. For the avid cinephile, it is tempting to think about the history of this substitution as a terrifying remake of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</em>In the course of a single decade, the long privilege of the analog image and the technology of analog image production have been almost completely replaced by digital simulations and digital processes. The celluloid strip with its reassuring physical passage of visible images, the noisy and cumbersome cranking of the mechanical film projector or the Steenbeck editing table, the imposing bulk of the film canister are all disappearing one by one into a virtual space, along with the images they so beautifully recorded and presented.</p>
            <p>What is left, then, of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as it is replaced, part by part, by digitization? Is this the end of film, and therefore the end of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies? Does<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies have a future in the twenty-first century?</p>
            <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">3. Back to the Future</h3>
            <p>Periods of intense technological change are always extremely interesting for film theory because the films themselves tend to stage its primary question: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">What is cinema?</em>The emergent digital era poses this question in a new and interesting way because for the first time in the history of film theory the photographic process is challenged as the basis of cinematic representation. If the discipline of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies is anchored to a specific material object a real conundrum emerges with the arrival of digital technologies as a dominant aesthetic and social force. For 150 years the material basis of photography, and then of film, has been defined by a process of the mechanical recording of images through the registration of reflected light on a photosensitive chemical surface. Moreover, most of the key debates on the representational nature of photographic and filmic media—and indeed whether and how they could be defined as an art—were deduced, rightly or wrongly, from the basic photographic/ cinematographic process.</p>
            <p>As digital processes come more and more to displace analogical ones, what is the potential import for a photographic ontology of film? Unlike analogical representations, which have as their basis a transformation of substance isomorphic with an originating image, virtual representations derive all their powers from numerical manipulation. Timothy Binkley greatly clarifies matters when he reminds us that numbers, and the kinds of symbolization they allow, are the first “virtual reality.”<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a6"><a href="#fn:a6">6</a></sup> The analogical arts are fundamentally arts of intaglio, or worked matter—a literal sculpting by light of hills and valleys in the raw film whose variable density produces a visible image. But the transformation of matter in the electronic and digital arts takes place on a different atomic register and in a different conceptual domain.Where analog media record traces of events, as Binckley puts it, digital media produce tokens of numbers: the constructive tools of Euclidian geometry are replaced by the computational tools of Cartesian geometry.</p>
            <p>This transformation in the concept of materiality is the key to understanding some basic distinctions between the analog and digital. Comparing computer-generated images with film reaffirms that photography’s principal powers are those of analogy and indexicality. The photograph is a receptive substance literally etched or sculpted by light forming a mold of the object’s reflected image. The image has both spatial and temporal powers that reinforce photography’s designative function with an existential claim. As Roland Barthes explained, photography is an “emanation of the referent” that testifies <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ça-a-été:</em>this thing was; it had a spatial existence that endured in time.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a7"><a href="#fn:a7">7</a></sup> Even film’s imaginary worlds, say, the moonscapes of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">2001,</em>are founded by these powers. Computer-generated images, alternatively, are wholly created from algorithmic functions. Analogy exists as a function of spatial recognition, of course, but it has loosed its anchors from both substance and indexicality. And it is not simply that visuality has been given a new mobility wherein any pixel in the electronic image can be moved or its value changed at will. Because the digital arts are without substance and therefore not easily identified as objects, no medium-specific ontology can fix them in place. The digital arts render all expressions as identical since they are all ultimately reducible to the same computational notation. The basis of all representation is virtuality: mathematical abstractions that render all signs as equivalent regardless of their output medium. Digital media are neither visual, nor textual, nor musical—they are simulations.</p>
            <p>But here a first important objection can be raised. Is “film” in its most literal sense synonymous with “cinema”? To say that film is disappearing means only that photochemical celluloid is starting to disappear as the medium for registering, distributing, and presenting images. As celluloid, with its satisfying substantiality and visibility available to the naked eye, disappears into a virtual and electronic realm, is<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself disappearing? When, after a long battle for legitimation in the academy, which has only recently been won and not in all corners of the humanities,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies is finally enjoying unprecedented professional recognition and maturity, has it all been for naught?</p>
            <p>One simple response is to say that digital cameras, or even “virtual” cameras creating wholly synthesized spaces on computers, are still based on the same optical geometry as traditional cameras and rely on the same historically and culturally evolved mathematics of depth and light rendering descended from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">perspectiva legittima.</em>Although digital processes have produced many fascinating stylistic innovations, there is a strong sense in which what counts intuitively as an “image” has changed very little for Western cultures for several centuries. Indeed, there is much to be learned from the fact that “photographic” realism remains the Holy Grail of digital imaging. If the digital is such a revolutionary process of image making, why is its technological and aesthetic goal to become perceptually indiscernible from an earlier mode of image production? A certain cultural sense of the “cinematic” and an unreflective notion of “realism” remain in many ways the touchstones for valuing the aesthetic innovations of the digital. Of course, what remains absent from the process of digital representation is what thinkers like André Bazin or Roland Barthes held fundamental to the photographic image: its causal force as a literal spatial and temporal molding of the originating event, preserved in a physical material.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, I think there is a deeper and more philosophical way of discussing “virtuality” in relation to both film and<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies. One consistent lesson from the history of film theory is that there has never been a general consensus concerning the answer to the question “What is cinema?” And for this reason the evolving thought on<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in the twentieth century has persisted in a continual state of identity crisis. Despite its range and complexity, the classical period of film aesthetics can be understood as a genealogy of conflicting debates that sought the identity of film in medium-specific concepts or techniques: the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">photogénie</em>of Louis Delluc and Jean Epstein; Béla Balázs’ defense of the close-up; the rhythmic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cinégraphie</em>dear to French Impressionist filmmakers; the montage debates during the Soviet golden age; Walter Benjamin on mechanical reproducibility and the decline of aura; Siegfried Kracauer’s photographic affinities; Bazin’s defense of the long take and composition in depth; and so forth. Arguably, this kind of argumentation extends all the way to the anti-illusionist theories of the avant-gardes of the 1960s and 1970s, which wanted to rid the medium of any extraneous literary and narrative codes in order to restore to film the aesthetic purity of its fundamental artistic materials: the elimination of depth to emphasize the flatness of the picture plane; manipulation of focus and other photographic properties to undermine representation and to draw attention to the grain and materiality of the image’s surface; the use of discontinuity to restore the autonomy of shot and frame and to draw attention to the transition between images; and so forth.</p>
            <p>In its historical efforts to define film as art, and thus to legitimate a new field of aesthetic analysis, never has one field so thoroughly debated, in such contradictory and interesting ways, the nature of its ontological grounding. The perceived necessity of defining the artistic possibilities of a medium by proving its unique ontological grounding in an aesthetic first principle derives from a long tradition in the history of philosophy. Deconstruction has not completely, or perhaps not even partially, purged our culture of the instinct to view and value Art in this way. This same perspective produced a sort of aesthetic inferiority complex in both film theory and<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies whereby, if all the above principles were true,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> could be defined only as a as mongrel medium that would never evolve in an aesthetically pure form. Hence the great paradox of classical film theory: intuitively, film seemed to have a material specificity with claims to self-identity; nonetheless, this specificity was notoriously difficult to pin down. There was something about the spatiality and the temporality of the medium that eluded, indeed confounded, hierarchies of value and concepts of judgment in modern aesthetics.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the difficulty of placing film as an object grounding an area of study does not begin with the digital “virtualization” of the image. Indeed one might say that the entire history of the medium, and of the critical thought that has accompanied it, has returned incessantly to film’s uncertain status. What accounts for this flux at the very heart of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies, which has always seemed less of a discipline than a constantly shifting terrain for thinking about time-based spatial media? All disciplines evolve and change, of course. But I would argue, and I think this is a positive thing, that film studies has never congealed into a discipline in the same way as English literature or art history. Even today it is far more common to find university<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies in a wide variety of interdisciplinary contexts; the fully-fledged Department of Film Studies is rather the exception that proves the rule. There are reasons both economic and political for this situation, but I find the possible philosophical explanations more interesting to explore.</p>
            <p>Cinema’s overwhelming and enduring status as mostly, though not exclusively, a popular and industrial art has proved exclusionary from a certain snobbish perspective. But there is another, deeper reason why<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies has remained the much-loved though bastard child of the humanities. From the standpoint of early modern aesthetic theory, the painting, the sculpture, and the book have a reassuring ontological stability—their status as objects, and therefore potentially <em class="notranslate" translate="no">aesthetic</em>objects, seems self-evident. However, despite the apparent solidity of the celluloid strip rolled with satisfying mass and weight on reels and cores, and despite continuities in the experience of watching projected motion pictures,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies has continually evolved as a field in search of its object.</p>
            <p>Why is “film” so difficult to place as an object of aesthetic investigation? Perhaps because it was the first medium to challenge fundamentally the concepts on which the very idea of the aesthetic was founded. Up until the emergence of cinema, most of the fine arts remained readily classifiable and rankable according to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s 1766 distinction between the arts of succession or time and simultaneity or space. As I argued in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reading the Figural,</em>this distinction became the basis for defining an aesthetic ontology that anchored individual arts in self-identical mediums and forms. Moreover, implied in Lessing’s distinction is a valuation of the temporal arts for their immateriality and thus their presumed spirituality or closeness to both voice and thought. Among the “new” media, the emergence of cinema, now more than 100 years old, unsettled this philosophical schema even if it did not successfully displace it. In the minds of most people<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> remains a “visual” medium. And more often than not it still defends its aesthetic value by aligning itself with the other visual arts and by asserting its self-identity as an image-making medium. Yet the great paradox of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> with respect to the conceptual categories of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century aesthetics is that it is a temporal and “immaterial” as well as spatial medium. The hybrid nature of cinematic expression—which combines moving photographic images, sounds, and music as well as speech and writing—has inspired equally cinema’s defenders and detractors. For its defenders, especially in the 1910s and 1920s, film represented a grand Hegelian synthesis—the apogee of the arts. Alternatively, from the most conservative point of view<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> can never be an art because it is a mongrel medium that will never rest comfortably within the philosophical history of the aesthetic. The suspicion, or anxiety, that<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> could not be defined as Art derived from its hybrid nature as both an art of space <em class="notranslate" translate="no">and</em>an art of time. Indeed, some of the most compelling contributions of classical film theory recognized and valued this: Erwin Panofsky’s definition of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as an art that dynamizes space and spatializes time; Sergei Eisenstein’s discussion of the filmic fourth dimension; and André Bazin’s account of the cinematographic image in terms of a temporal as well as spatial realism or a unique spatial record of duration. The most philosophically elaborate discussion of this idea would be Gilles Deleuze’s concepts of the movement-image and the time-image.</p>
            <p>The difficult hybridity of film can be pushed even further. In early modern aesthetics there is a traditional privileging of what Nelson Goodman called the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">autographic</em>arts.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a8"><a href="#fn:a8">8</a></sup> These are the arts of signature. From hand-drafted manuscript to easel painting, autographic arts are defined by action—the physical contact of the artist’s hand—and by a certain telos: they are concluded as aesthetic objects once the artist’s hand has completed her or his work. All autographic arts are therefore unique. There is only one original; any repeated manifestation must be either a copy or a forgery.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, Goodman’s criteria for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">allographic</em>arts, of which music is his primary example, include the following. They are two-stage arts in which there is a spatial and temporal separation between composition and performance. More important, they are amenable to notation. Here the primary creative work is finished when the notation is complete. All performances are variants on this principal act. Thus musical composition is a kind of writing, as of course is literature or poetry, though painting and sculpture are not. And while the action of printing is allographic, like painting literature is an autographic art for Goodman in that the creative act flows from and terminates with the artist’s hand. Repeated printings are simply instantiations, then, that are identical in all relevant aspects with the original notation.</p>
            <p>Film shares with music a difficult status in the history of aesthetic evaluation, and Goodman’s concepts help us understand why. All two-stage arts are difficult to judge because the author is absent from the performance. No “signature” verifies their authenticity as art, even if the composer conducts his or her own work. The touchstone here is that the temporal and allographic arts lack a tactile substance that serves as the medium for a permanent and inalterable authorial inscription. And in fact, film shares with music a real Dionysian madness as a result of its complex temporality.</p>
            <p>However, in music the notational act of composition serves as the guarantee of the author’s signature. And here film differentiates itself most clearly from music according to Goodman’s criteria. Film is obviously a two-stage and perhaps a multistage art, but where do we make the division between composition and performance? Paradoxically, making a photographic image would seem to be, like etching or lithography, both an autographic and twostage process. From Bazin to Barthes, the photographic act is understood as producing a unique record of a singular duration. But subsequent prints must be struck from an original, thus constituting the second stage of the photographic process. As in lithography, “The prints are the end-products; and although they may differ appreciably from one another, all are instances of the original work. But even the most exact copy produced otherwise than by printing from that plate counts not as an original but as an imitation or forgery” (“Art and Authenticity” 114). Thus, in either photography or cinematography, producing an “original” may not serve as a notational act. Here technological reproducibility raises obvious problems. The original negative of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane</em>(1941) is lost. Rhetorically, one may wonder if all existing prints are therefore imitations. And this is to set aside the vexed question of who is the author of a film: the screenwriter? the director? the star actor? Do films have a primary notational origin: the script? the storyboard? Is the film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane</em>simply the performance of Herman Mankiewicz’s and Orson Welles’s written screenplay? Or is the film the unique preservation of the multiple creative acts performed both before the camera and afterward, in the postproduction processes of editing image and sound? In any case, as in musical composition, all are displaced in space and time from the actual performance of the film.</p>
            <p>The digital image extends these problems in another direction. Computergenerated images are not autographic for two reasons: as “synthetic” images they cannot be considered the physical act of the author’s hand, nor do they result in an end product. Indeed one of the great creative powers of digital images is their lack of closure, a quality Philip Rosen has characterized as “practically infinite manipulability”: they are easily reworked, reappropriated, and recontextualized.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a9"><a href="#fn:a9">9</a></sup> Synthesis, sampling, and sequencing are among the fundamental creative acts—or what I will later call, after Stanley Cavell, the automatisms—of the digital arts. In this respect they are the very antithesis of the autographic arts. Alternatively, they are a paradigm for allographic arts, since any copy is fully identical with the “original.” This is so for a specific reason. One can say that the sampling and reworking of a digital image is a new performance of it or even indeed that the new performance is a citation or paraphrase of the “original.” But even if films or live music can also cite or paraphrase precedent works, they are not allographic arts in the same way as computer-generated works.Why? Because these digital creations are produced by a rigorous notation: the algorithms, programs, or instruction sets according to which they are computed. While <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Toy Story</em>has as many authors as any big-budget Hollywood movie, paradoxically, it is fully notational in ways that no predigital-era film could be.</p>
            <p>It is important to emphasize that Goodman’s argument is not an “aesthetic” one, since the criteria of signature and uniqueness are the grounds neither for valuing nor for defining the specificity of art forms. Nonetheless, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">autographicality</em>and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">notationality</em>would seem to function as concepts defining the aesthetic nature of creative acts. The clearest examples of autographic arts imply a unique author whose work is accomplished in a one-stage act. Twostage arts require aesthetic grounding in a system of ideally inalterable notation. Film does not fully satisfy either criterion. Alternatively, the synthetic image presents a radical case: undoubtedly a two-stage image, it can also be considered fully notational. Reproducing the same program or algorithm will produce an image identical with the “original” if such an original can be said to exist.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a10"><a href="#fn:a10">10</a></sup> Unlike other two-stage arts, each performance will be identical instantiations of the same instruction set. Neither music nor dance can make this claim. And paradoxically, by this criterion the synthetic image would be aesthetic in a way the film image is not. (And here is a most terrible conclusion: every art has aesthetic value except film!)</p>
            <p>Film’s difficult status with respect to concepts of notationality has been a key concept of film theory, especially the structuralist and semiological approaches of the postwar period. And here we can return to the film/cinema distinction with interesting consequences.</p>
            <p>Film theory gained much from an awkward term when Etienne Souriau designated as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">filmophanic</em>the film perceived as such by the spectator during projection. This effort to make precise the different analytical dimensions of film theory—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">profilmic</em>space in front of the camera, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">screen</em>space (photographic dimension), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">film</em>space (temporal dimension), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">spectatorial</em>or psychological space—derived from a fundamental distinction coined by Gilbert Cohen-Séat in 1946, that of cinematographic and filmic facts.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a11"><a href="#fn:a11">11</a></sup> As Christian Metz noted in his commentary on this distinction in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Language and Cinema,</em>what we culturally define as “film” has a dizzying series of overlapping and often contradictory connotations: a physical object resting in film cans; an object of economic exchange; an aesthetic object defined both singularly and generally. For Metz, Cohen-Séat’s distinction had the value of putting film theory on a sound methodological basis, for “filmic facts” isolate film as a localizable signifying discourse with respect to its varying sociological, economic, technological, and industrial contexts.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a12"><a href="#fn:a12">12</a></sup> Here film comes into focus as an object of theory as a semiological fact that is distinguishable from the vaster social and historical terrain of cinematic phenomena, some of which intervene <em class="notranslate" translate="no">before</em>production (economic and legislative infrastructure, studio organization, technological invention and innovation, biographies of creative personnel), others <em class="notranslate" translate="no">after</em>the film (audience and critical response, ideological and cultural impact of the film, star mythology), and others <em class="notranslate" translate="no">during</em>the film but <em class="notranslate" translate="no">apart from</em>and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">outside of it</em>(architectural and cultural context of movie viewing, and so on).</p>
            <p>Metz’s goal here is not only to specify the object of film theory, but also to delimit precisely the object of film semiology. And here, suddenly, is the brilliance and difficulty of his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Language and Cinema.</em>In his rereading of Cohen- Séat, Metz distinguishes between <em class="notranslate" translate="no">film</em>as actual or a concrete discursive unity, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</em>as an ideal set. This distinction launches us toward another sense of the virtuality of film and film theory. Cohen-Séat calls “cinema” the sum of phenomena surrounding the film while remaining external to it. But film theory cannot do without a certain concept of cinema, or at least a sense of the word “cinema,” which in everyday parlance refers also to “the sum of films themselves, or rather the sum of traits which, in the films themselves, are taken to be characteristic of what is sensed to be a certain ‘language’ . . . There is also the same relationship between<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and films as between literature and books, painting and paintings, sculpture and sculptures, etc.” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Language</em>22). Thus, when one speaks of “cross-cutting” in the climactic sequence of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Matrix,</em>in which the action of Neo’s final confrontation with the Agents in the simulated world of the Matrix is alternated with an attack by the robotic Sentinels on the rebel ship <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nebuchadnezzar</em>in the “real” world, one refers to it as a singular filmic figure while also saying that the figure is cinematographic; that is, it has the qualities of belonging to<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> or the semiological/aesthetic resources of cinema. By a curious dialectical turn,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in this sense reinscribes itself within the filmic fact as defined by Cohen-Séat.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the semiological distinction between<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and film requires a vertiginous dialectical circularity between two terms and two sets. Here film and<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> are contrasted as actual and ideal objects that in fact cannot be separated. This is the difference between an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">énoncé,</em>or discrete utterance, and language or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">langue,</em>as a virtual system of differences; or, more simply, the difference between an individual and concrete message and the abstract code that gives it sense. Thus the semiological status of film cannot be established without reference back to a specificity that is, paradoxically, cinematographic. But according to Metz this specificity is defined neither by the criterion of substantial self-similarity (the uniqueness of a medium or a material) nor by an aesthetic ontology. It can be defined only by the set of all possible films or filmic figures that could be derived from the possibilities of cinematic “language,” and this language is in a continual state of innovation and change.</p>
            <p>So now film theory confronts two kinds of ideal sets. One groups together all the potential messages of a certain perceptual or aesthetic order without necessarily coinciding with either a single and unique code or a homogeneous substance. These are all the actual films that have been or could be made, that is, aesthetic artifacts defined as “cinema” in the same sense that the novels of Henry James could be defined as “literature.” But the sense or meaning of individual films would be impossible to analyze without a unity of another kind—that of code. Here Metz makes a definite break not only with classical film theory but also with classical aesthetics. Within the filmic, the cinematographic inscribes itself as a vast virtuality that is nonetheless specific and homogeneous— this is the notion of cinematic codes. The notion of codes could not be constructed without the possibility of regrouping, at least conceptually, “all messages of a certain sensory modality,” that is, the totality of films that constitute cinema. But only the messages are concrete and singular; the codes are virtual, and the quality of being cinematic in no way derives from the physical nature of the signifier. A code, then, “is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a constructed rather than inherent unity, and it does not exist prior to analysis</em>. . . [Codes] are . . . units which aim at formalization. Their homogeneity is not a sensory one, but rather one of logical coherence, of explanatory power, of generative capacity” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Language</em>28; my emphasis).</p>
            <p>Thus, the quality of being cinematic, or even of defining, if we still dare, cinematographic specificity, rests on the analysis and definition of a code or codes immanent to the set of all films. But “immanent” does mean originating in either an ontology or the material specificity of the signifier. The materiality of the cinematic signifier, as Metz often insisted, is heterogeneous. Fundamentally, it is composed from five matters of expression: moving photographic images, speech, sound effects, music, and graphic traces. Moreover, any given narrative film will be comprised of a plurality of codes, both cinematic and noncinematic, whose very nature is to be conceptually heterogeneous. Here<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> presents an important lesson in philosophy to modern aesthetics, for it is useless to want to define the specificity of any medium according to criteria of ontological self-identification or substantial selfsimilarity. Heterogeneous and variable both in its matters of expression and in the plurality of codes that organize them, the set of all films is itself an uncertain territory that is in a state of continual change. It is itself a conceptual virtuality, though populated with concrete objects, that varies unceasingly, and therefore, to extract the codes that give this sense narrative and cultural meaning is a process that is, as Freud would have said, interminable.</p>
            <p>The historical variability behind film’s virtual life can be posed from yet another perspective, and it may be a less happy one. In his remarkable book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Death of Cinema: History, Cultural Memory, and the Digital Dark Age,</em>Paolo Cherchi Usai makes a startling claim that complicates film’s virtual life.<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is inherently an autodestructive medium. Every art suffers the ravages of time, of course. But structural impermanence is the very condition of cinema’s existence. Each passage of frames through a projector—the very machine that gives filmophanic/projected life to the moving image—advances a process of erosion that will eventually reduce the image to nothing.Moreover, what Cherchi Usai calls the “matrix,” or the chemical substrate, of film is perhaps the most impermanent and variable substance for the registration of images yet found in the history of art-making: what doesn’t explode in flames (nitrate) will slowly dissolve (vinegar syndrome). Digital media have their own forms of entropic decay and obsolescence, of course. Nonetheless, one may say that the material basis of film is a chemically encoded process of entropy. This is one of many ways in which watching film is literally a spectatorship of death.</p>
            <p>The history of film and film theory has often fantasized the existence of a Model Image. In Cherchi Usai’s terminology this is the perfect or normative image—an eternal and Platonic form perfectly consistent with aesthetic norms of photographic beauty and pleasure. But not only is this Model Image imaginary in the full psychoanalytic as well as philosophical senses of the term; film history would not exist if the Image was permanent and atemporal. The intelligibility of film history, no less than of film theory, relies on the virtuality of the image in the sense that what it documents is the disappearance of its object. As Cherchi Usai puts it: “The ultimate goal of film history is an account of its own disappearance, or its transformation into another entity. In such a case, a narrating presence has the prerogative of resorting to the imagination to describe the phases leading from the hypothetical Model Image to the complete oblivion of what the moving images once represented.”<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a13"><a href="#fn:a13">13</a></sup></p>
            <p>Curiously, from the standpoint of film theory this might be a strange defense of film art from the perspective of the aesthetic. Often criticized in the history of the aesthetic as a medium of mechanical copying, the aesthetic experience of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is in essence nonrepeatable. No two prints of the same film will ever be identical—each will always bear its unique traces of destruction with a specific projection history; thus each print is in some respects unique. And, for similar reasons, there will never be identically repeatable viewings of the same print. Thus, Cherchi Usai writes: “The assumption is that the spectator is indifferent to the fact that the moving image is derived from a matrix, and believes in the possibility of seeing it again under the same condition as previously. From that standpoint, as much as in oral literature . . .<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is not based on reproduction. It is an art of repetition” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Death of Cinema</em>59). And this is true so long as we keep in mind that each repetition is also a difference.</p>
            <p>Cherchi Usai is that rarest of animal, a film historian and archivist who is also a philosopher. And once historians begin to think like philosophers (an unlikely event in any case) the impertinent scandal of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Death of Cinema</em>will achieve its full force. Moving image “conservation” is impossible, and moving image “restoration” is a contradiction in terms, since time is not reversible. And there is poetic justice in the fact that film, being among the most temporal, and therefore virtual, of the arts, is also the art on which the entropic quality of time works fastest. In this respect, Cherchi Usai recommends giving up all claims to resurrecting the Model Image.</p>
            <p>Moving image preservation will then be redefined as the science of its gradual loss and the art of coping with the consequences, very much like a physician who has accepted the inevitability of death even while he continues to fight for the patient’s life. In monitoring the progress of image decay, the conservator assumes the responsibility of following the process until the image has vanished altogether, or ensures its migration to another kind of visual experience, while interpreting the meaning of the loss for the benefit of future generations. In doing so, the conservator— no less than the viewer—plays a creative role that is in some way comparable to the work of the image maker. The final outcome of the death of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the foundation of an ethics of vision and the transformation of the Model image into the Moral Image, mirroring the imperatives and values connected with the act of viewing. (105)</p>
            <p>Film, it would seem, is a very uncertain object. And it is this very instability that makes it so riveting and fascinating for some, and a cultural scandal for others. The solid ontological anchoring of a worked substance is grasped only with difficulty, yielding an art that, so far, leans more than any other on an experience of the Imaginary. On this basis the virtuality of film takes on yet a new sense. In a short but brilliant essay, Raymond Bellour defines film as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">le texte introuvable,</em>or “the unfindable text.” The difficulties of film semiology return implicitly here to the questions of notationality raised by Goodman. Literary texts may be cited critically and analytically in the same notation as their source. But film loses what is most specific to it once it is captured in a different analytic medium: the frame enlargement or film still absents the movement that defines its particular form of visuality: “On the one hand, [film] spreads in space like a picture; on the other it plunges into time, like a story which its serialization into writing approximates more or less to the musical work. In this it is peculiarly unquotable, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">since the written text cannot restore to it what only the projector can produce;</em>a movement, the illusion of which guarantees the reality.”<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a14"><a href="#fn:a14">14</a></sup> Writing may capture succession. Yet it fails to reproduce film’s peculiar quality of an automated, ineluctable movement. Here the curious paradox of film is that its materiality cannot be grasped because it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">resists writing.</em>And one of the curious consequences of structuralist film theory and narratology is their demonstration of film narration as a complex, highly elaborated, and codified system that nonetheless escapes notation.</p>
            <p>By the same token, the imbrication of spatiality with temporality in film, and the fact that it cannot be anchored in a system of notationality, lead to another idea: that of Metz’s definition of film as the “Imaginary signifier.” The passage in film semiology from the structuralist to the psychoanalytic conception of the signifier pushed Metz towards a redefinition of film as a sensory modality that is also a psychical structuring. Rather than a haptic object or a stable self-identical form, the film viewer is always in pursuit of an absent, indeed an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">absenting,</em>object. In Metz’s elegant description, psychologically the spectator is always in pursuit of a double absence: the hallucinatory projection of an absent referent in space as well as the slipping away of images in time. The inherent virtuality of the image is a fundamental condition of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> viewing where the ontological insecurity of film as an aesthetic object is posed as both a spatial uncertainty and a temporal instability.</p>
            <p>So, even the filmophanic definition, which defines the singularity of film as a phenomenological event—the attended film projection—finds itself split by a certain virtuality. And in this respect, I still hold that the experience of the imaginary signifier is something of a psychological constant in theatrical film viewing. Instead of an “aesthetic” analysis, cinematic specificity becomes the location of a variable constant, the instantiation of a certain form of desire that is at once semiological, psychological, technological, and cultural. Here film theory reconnects usefully with the historical argument above. Throughout the twentieth century, the technological processes of film production have innovated constantly, its narrative forms have evolved continuously, and its modes of distribution and exhibition have also varied widely. But what has persisted is a certain mode of psychological investment—a modality of desire if you will. Film theory, and the history of film theory, remains important for the range of concepts and methods it has developed for defining the “cinematic,” no matter how variable the concept, and for evaluating both the spectatorial experience (perceptual, cognitive, affective) and the range of cultural meanings that devolve from films.</p>
            <p>Now that the Society for<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> Studies has changed its name to the Society for<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and Media Studies, one might be tempted to conclude that this is a case of “If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.” Or, more conservatively, one could imagine an organization of archivists and antiquarians content with rehearsing and refining their understanding of a medium which had a good run but which is now simply “history.”</p>
            <p>While historically many important debates in film theory have based themselves in a certain materiality, it is nonetheless a historical actuality that film has no persistent identity. Rather, its (variable) specificity lies elsewhere: a twofold virtuality defined by a vertiginous spatialization of time and temporalization of space as well as a peculiar perceptual and psychological instability wherein the spectator pursues a doubly absent object. Consequently,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies can claim no ontological ground as a discipline—that is, if we continue to insist that the self-identity of an art be defined by medium specificity, or what I have called the criterion of substantial self-similarity. In fact the ontological ungroundedness of film from the standpoint of aesthetic philosophy offers an important object lesson for every discipline that seeks a stable frame or substance. That specificity, no matter how mobile, derives from and is legitimated by the wealth of its concepts. In this respect, institutional<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies has recently neglected to its peril the importance of theory and the history of theory: the invention, critique, and reassessment of the fundamental concepts that underlie the kinds of questions we ask—whether historical, sociological, or aesthetic—and the kinds of answers those questions allow.</p>
            <p>So,<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies can stake no permanent claims on its disciplinary territories; its borders are in fact continually shifting. Stating the matter in its most specific terms: there is no medium-based ontology that grounds film as an aesthetic medium and serves as an anchor for its claims to exist as a humanistic discipline. Now the same could be said for both the College Art Association and every section of the Modern Language Association. And it would be hard to find a humanities professor these days who wouldn’t be willing to take the default deconstructive position that the claim for self-identity in their respective disciplines is just an illusion based on a faulty assumption (that is, until the time comes to argue for a new post!). At the same time, the study of literature and of the history of art still enjoy a cultural prestige that is hardly secured for the study of film, much less for the study of digital and interactive media. The enduring quality of the book as an “interface,” for example, as well as the social forms of its use, enjoy a history whose <em class="notranslate" translate="no">durée</em>is long enough to be forgotten by many as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">having</em>a history, and an embattled one. And this perceived permanence contributes to the ideological solidity of an idea of literature and its persistent cultural capital.</p>
            <p>Contrariwise, the history of film and<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has been lived in a mere three or four generations in which the medium’s aesthetic and social forms have evolved rapidly and varied considerably. However, the impermanence and mutability of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies as a field should be seen as one of its great strengths: the self-consciousness of film theory about the uncertain ontological status of the medium and the conflictual nature of the debates that have defined the genealogy of film study mark it still as one of the most intellectually daring areas of intellectual inquiry of the last century. And this, I believe, is one of the persistent attractions of film for intellectuals.</p>
            <p>I will return to these ideas at the end of Part III, as well as to the stillunanswered question of<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> studies in relation to the “new” media. But before turning to these questions, we must try to answer another: What <em class="notranslate" translate="no">was</em>cinema?</p>

                    <li id="fn:a1">This is not unlike the case of Hugo Münsterberg, the preeminent American psychologist at the turn of the twentieth century, whose final book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Photoplay: A Psychological Study</em>, is perhaps the first work of English-language film theory. Münsterberg was no longer young, however, and rumor has it that his fascination was sparked by the image of a young actress, Annette Kellerman, in the 1915 film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Neptune’s Daughter</em>.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
                    <li id="fn:a2">For an overview of Hollywood’s response to the rise of network television, see Tino Balio, ed., <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood in the Age of Television</em> (Boston: Unwin Hyman, 1990); and Janet Wasko’s contribution to Peter Lev, ed., <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Transforming the Screen</em>, 1950–1959 (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 2003) 127–146.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a2">↩</a></li>
                    <li id="fn:a3">The response to the explosive growth of home video in the 1980s was somewhat different. Here the paradigm film is undoubtedly David Cronenberg’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Videodrome</em> (1983), in which video paranoia comes in the form of the half-inch cassette as the bearer of infection. Unlike the spectacular CinemaScope and Cinerama films of the 1950s, however, many of the video paranoia horror films were small-screen works that began to feed the direct-to-video market. Moreover, after an initial dip in theater attendance, video developed as a major revenue source for the major studios and their multinational corporate underwriters and now accounts for a significant portion of a film’s profit margin. By the mid-1980s there was even a boom in new theater construction. For a useful overview, see Stephen Prince’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980–89</em> (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 2000), especially 79–89.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a3">↩</a></li>
                    <li id="fn:a4">The counterexample, of course, is experimental films influenced by the machine aesthetic prevalent in the European avant-gardes of the 1920s. Ferdinand Léger and Dudley Murphy’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ballet Mécanique</em> (1924) is one example, but even more appropriate is Dziga Vertov’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Man with a Movie Camera</em> (1929), in which machinism represents a specifically filmic aesthetic by exploiting, and making the subject of the film, all the mechanical possibilities of analyzing and reconstituting movement and the relations among movements distributed in space. This was also part and parcel of a more general Soviet theoretical fascination with the mechanical engineering of the actor’s body and human vision by the filmic apparatus. <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a4">↩</a></li>
                    <li id="fn:a5">For an interesting historical and aesthetic survey of these issues, see Andrew Darley’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Visual Digital Culture: Surface, Play, and Spectacle in New Media Genres</em> (New York: Routledge, 2000); as well as the anthologies <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Culture, Technology, and Creativity in the Twentieth Century</em>, ed. Philip Hayward (London: J. Libbey, 1990); and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Future Visions: New Technologies of the Screen</em>, ed. Philip Hayward and Tana Wollen (London: British Film Institute, 1993). Another significant factor in this history is what <em class="notranslate" translate="no">American Cinematographer</em> referred to already in June 1981 as “the emerging new film/video interface,” meaning primarily video-assisted shooting and electronic editing (linear and nonlinear). Initially, the most significant effect was on postproduction. See Prince, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New Pot of Gold</em> 111–123; as well as Charles Eidsvik’s “Machines of the Invisible: Changes in Film Technology in the Age of Video” and Jean-Pierre Geuns’s “Through the Looking Glasses: From the Camera Obscura to Video Assist,” both in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Film Quarterly: Forty Years—A Selection</em>, ed.

Goodman in no way assumes hierarchies of value in presenting the distinction between autographic and allographic arts. His concern, rather, is with how the problem of discourse shifts with respect to different forms and strategies of notationality in nonlinguistic art practices.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a8">↩</a></li>

                    <li id="fn:a10">There is an even more unusual paradox here. As various synesthetic programs like Color Music and Text-to-Midi show, the same algorithm can be used to produce outputs in different media: a set of musical sounds may be transformed as color values or ASCII text as music. In this sense, from the perspective of notation the resultant color or sound is mathematically identical with its “source” even though perceptually their inputs and outputs differ. In Part III I will further explain that such creative automatisms are made possible by a key aspect of information processing— the separation of inputs and outputs.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a10">↩</a></li>
