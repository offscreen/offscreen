        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Staging And Style</h2>
        <p>You are a film director. Today the script requires four of your characters to have a conversation around a dinner table. How might you stage and shoot it?</p>
        <p>You could place the camera a fair distance back and record the scene in one continuous shot. This can be efficient if your actors know their lines well; no need to change camera positions and relight several shots. But people tend to arrange themselves on all sides of a table, so unless you set up a Last Supper composition, at least one person will be facing away from us. What if that person has some important lines? Even if that person merely reacts to others, don’t we want to see his or her face occasionally? Finally, what if during postproduction you decide that the pace is too sluggish? If you want to eliminate some dead spots, you’ll have to cut, but if you film one long take you have no shots to insert.</p>
        <p>So you consider presenting your dinner-table scene in several shots. You might give each character a separate shot-what American filmmakers call a “<span>single</span>”-whenever that character speaks or reacts. This was a common solution in the 1920s, and it worked well for silent film, since a single could specify the source of a dialogue intertitle, and facial expression added important information about how we are to understand the line (see Figs. I.I-1.3). In Japan Ozu Yasujiro happily refined this approach well into the sound era (Figs. 1.4-1.5). Still, cutting together many singles may create a choppy feel, and it doesn’t cover every eventuality. When two characters seated side by side start to chat, you may want a shot that includes both. Then singles can be reserved for underscoring a key line or facial expression. Sometimes, too, you will want to remind the audience of where characters are sitting by angling the camera to show a bit of one, say a shoulder or an elbow, in the foreground while the shot favors the character opposite.</p>
        <p>So you’ve decided to break your dinner-table scene into a variety of shot scales, some showing several characters, others picking out one or two. In effect, you’ve come up with the solution developed in the “<span>classical</span>” age of sound filmmaking in most countries around the world (Figs. 1.6-1.8), and it remains one salient option.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p>Whether you shoot only singles or a mixture of singles and more distant framings , you confront some problems. For the sake of speed and economy it’s best to film shots taken from a single camera setup all at once, regardless of where they’ll eventually cut into the scene. If we are going to use several two-shots of Anna and Bart in the course of the scene, we should shoot all of those in a batch. Then we shift the camera angle to film all our shots of Anna alone before shifting again to shoot all our singles of Bart. In sum, we will shoot each actor’s lines, gesture, and glances “<span>out of continuity</span>”.</p>
        <p>Filming around a table in this fashion consumes a lot of production time. Kevin Bacon, actor turned director, complains: “<span>It’s a real pain in the ass to shoot dining-room scenes because you’ve got to go all the way around the room with coverage</span>”.<sup>2</sup> This solution is also hard on the actors, who must break their performances into pieces taken out of chronological order. Moreover, as the scene progresses, people are eating, drinking, putting down napkins , and indulging in other bits of business. If an actor waves her fork in a two-shot, she ought to wave it the same way in the over-the -shoulder shot, which might be filmed days later. If an actor drinks half a glass of wine in one shot, the glass had better be half- empty in the next shot (even if that shot’s setup was taken days before). “<span>If you film such scenes without preparation</span>”, notes Kitano Takeshi, “<span>the moment you change camera position, the hands, for instance, will be positioned differently, and you risk not being able to match the different takes</span>”.<sup>3</sup> The script supervisor (formerly known as the script girl) is charged with keeping track of shot-to-shot continuity, but there are so many details involved that most dinner-table scenes will contain mismatches.<sup>4</sup> “<span>If you’ve got a lot of people around a table</span>”, remarks Anna Campion, “<span>it can honestly drive you mental</span>”.<sup>5</sup></p>
        <p>The problems of matching eyelines, props, and movements are so great that contemporary filmmakers often take a different tack: filming the meal with a camera circling the table to pass from character to character at the proper moment. You might use rather lengthy arcing movements, as Woody Allen does in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hannah and Her Sisters</em> (1985), or you might try for the sort of briefer moving shots that Quentin Tarantino uses in the opening of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reservoir Dogs</em> (1994, Figs. 1.9-1.10). One contemporary directing manual recommends the circling camera as the best way to dodge the numerous matching problems raised by “<span>the dinner-table conundrum</span>”.<sup>6</sup> Yet, like all solutions, this one closes off other options. If you handle the conversation in lengthy spiraling shots, the pace of the scene can’t later be tightened or slowed by cutting. If you cut up the roaming shots, then the old difficulties of continuity reappear. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reservoir Dogs</em> avoids some of these problems by tightly framing the gang members’ faces so that we can’t see the food on their plates, and their hands become visible only sporadically. Tarantino has explained that he used the moving camera so that “<span>you don’t quite get a bearing on anybody, whds talking, who are these people, you’re slightly confused</span>”.<sup>7</sup> In making these choices, however, he has relinquished actors’ byplay with food and drink, an important component of Ozu’s and Minnelli’s scenes. Every choice eliminates certain possibilities.</p>
        <p>The dinner-table conundrum can stand as an emblem for many types of scenes . You face the same decisions if you’re shooting a poker game, or a gang planning a heist, or officers in GHQ poring over a map of enemy territory, or mourners gathered around a grave. Whenever three or more characters surround a common site, the problems of staging and shooting and editing will be similar. To solve these problems, filmmakers have developed fairly standardized craft practices-stylistic routines that I’ll be calling <em>schemas</em>.<sup>8</sup> Classical continuity filming provides two principal schemas: the silent-era approach emphasizing singles, and the more mixed sound-cinema strategy. The circular tracking shots now common for such scenes provide a third schema, also grounded in assumptions about spatial continuity.</p>
        <p>Are these the only schemas available? Perhaps we passed over one option too quickly. Suppose we shot our dinner-table scene with a stationary camera, set somewhat back, in a single take, as in the South Korean film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors</em> (a.k.a. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oh, Su-jeong</em>! 2000). Our three main characters are at a drinking party, with everyone gathered around one low table. The entrepreneur Jae -hoon and the television director Yeong-su are both carrying on affairs with Yeong-su’s assistant, Su-jeong. Late in the evening we get a shot showing all three ranged along one side of the table, with another woman in the left foreground and a young man turned from us in the right foreground (Fig. I.II).</p>
        <p>Director Hong Sang-soo presents the entire scene in an unmoving take lasting ninetysix seconds. He thereby forfeits the advantages of editing (tightening up the pace in postproduction, cutting to closer views to underscore a line or reaction) and camera movement (highlighting one reaction after another, “<span>giving energy</span>” to the scene). And although the composition turns two characters away from us, it favors three other figures rather than only one, so Hong will have to rely almost entirely on ensemble performance. At the start of the scene the somewhat fussy Jae-hoon, who has invested in Yeong-su’s film, asks how preproduction is going, and the drunken Yeong-su replies sarcastically, “<span>Oh, now you’re interested in me?</span>” (Fig. 1.12). Since the first part of the scene is about the two men’s disintegrating friendship, the composition gives them the privileged position, with Jae-hoon in the center of the frame and Yeong-su right beside him, facing us. Su-jeong becomes a secondary presence, her eyes lowered and her face shielded by strands of hair, but one can sense some embarrassment in her posture. Jae-hoon lowers his eyes before Yeong-su’s onslaught, leaving Yeong-su the most visible face at the table. He demands that Su-jeong serve him, as if flaunting his power over her, and Jae-hoon quietly rises and leaves the table (Fig. 1.13). This is an attention-getting movement, centered in the frame and underscored by Yeong-su’s momentary lowering of his eyes. Su-jeong watches Jae hoon go out of frame, and the woman in the left foreground also turns her head, in the process making Su-jeong’s response more visible (Fig. 1.14).</p>
        <p>Su-jeong slides into the center slot (Fig. 1.15). This marks a second phase of the scene, in which she’ll display distress at Yeong-su’s aggressive drunkenness. He urges her to drink, and as if echoing his demand, the woman on the left picks up a cognac bottle and inspects it before pouring herself another (Fig. 1.16). Su-jeong protests softly that she doesn’t want any more. As she does, the young man in the right foreground puts a restraining hand on the cognac bottle (Fig. 1.17), but by then the other woman has emptied it. Finally, Yeong-su accepts Su-jeong’s unwillingness to drink and says, “<span>Okay, my turn</span>”, before gulping down another glassful (Fig. 1.18). The scene ends with Su-jeong pouring him a fresh drink (Fig. 1.19).</p>
        <p>Hong’s manner of handling requires some fairly careful choreography, most apparent when Su-jeong’s face becomes visible just as Jae-hoon leaves (Fig. 1.14) and when the youth in the right foreground shifts rightward slightly to let us see Yeong-su drain his glass greedily (Fig. 1.18). The trouble that Hong and his players have taken yields some distinct advantages. By placing the camera somewhat far back, the framing builds the texture of the scene out of both faces and gestures-the repeated acts of pouring, of checking the cognac bottle, of trying to restrain the second woman. The episode benefits from the simultaneous presence of action and reaction: while Yeong-su lashes out, we can see both Jae-hoon’s shame and Su-jeong’s discomfiture, reactions that would have been rendered as successive events if they had been presented in single shots.</p>
        <p>Cutting in to singles would also not have permitted Hong to include the sort of small bodily echoes that researchers tell us are a basic part of human interaction. Conversing people execute a dance of mirrored postures and gestures.<sup>9</sup> Here the echoes underscore the moment-by-moment turns of action. Yeong-su lowers his head as Jae-hoon leaves; the woman in the left foreground turns her head in a mimicry of Su-jeong’s head movement (Fig. 1.14); the same woman slides aside just a little bit at the same moment Sujeong slips into Jae-hoon’s place (Fig. 1.15). Similarly, while Yeong-su urges a reluctant Su-jeong to drink, the young man in the foreground tries to keep the other woman from drinking more (Figs. 1.16-1.17). The nearest couple’s byplay remains subsidiary because of the way the frame emphasizes the three protagonists. At first, by pivoting two characters’ backs toward us, Hong denies the couple the emphasis that cutting or tracking shots might give them; but he then makes a virtue of exactly their secondary status. If Hong had cut around the table to show a two-shot of the woman inspecting the bottle and of the boy trying to keep her from drinking, he would have underscored actions that here form a subdued counterpoint to the thrust of the scene. The long take from a middle distance position has produced what Charles Barr calls “<span>gradation of emphasis</span>”, a scale of dramatic overtones resonating with the shot’s main action.<sup>10</sup></p>
        <p>Like all stylistic choices, Hong’s approach closes off other possibilities, but the options he embraces belong to an important tradition in cinematic staging, one whose implications go far beyond dinner-table situations. That tradition, running back to the earliest days of cinema, has become more and more neglected. Few filmmakers today subscribe to it, and few film scholars probe its possibilities . It is what this book is about.</p>
        <p>Over most of cinema’s history, staging was crucial to moviemaking. From the early 1900s to the 1970s, directors working in film industries on every continent were expected to tum the script into scenes, and that task involved plotting, moment by moment, the dramatic interactions of characters in space. In studio systems, staging was the foundation of the director’s craft. There were specialists in lighting and costume, set design and cutting, but the director was responsible for shaping the performances across the arc of the scene. There were no film schools to teach this skill. Directors picked it up through observation, informal advice, and trial and error. Some mastered only the basics, whereas others refined their craft to startling levels of subtlety. They seldom talked about it to outsiders ; one finds almost no written record of the schemas guiding staging. We can reconstruct them only through watching the movies.</p>
        <p>An unassuming art, it passed unnoticed by audiences. What do we remember from a movie? Some settings , the actors’ faces, flashes of pathos and humor, a striking line or gesture. Yet those vivid instants burst out of a quiet, insistent pressure that prepares us for them, like the small movements and prolonged stillnesses that set into relief Jae-hoon’s abrupt departure from the table (Figs. I .12-I.14). It is indeed hard to watch for such things. We don’t know how the action will unfold, so we cannot usually spot the minor-key preparatory work. For reasons I ‘11 sketch later, we rightly concentrate on the faces, the words, and the gestures, testing each one for its relevance to the ongoing story action. Yet the faces (and the bodies), the words (and the reactions to the words), and the gestures (and the interplay of gestures) are all working together. At every instant, in most storytelling cinema, cinematic staging delivers the dramatic field to our attention, sculpting it for informative, expressive, and sometimes simply pictorial effect. We don’t notice it, but it affects us.</p>
        <p>Nor have critics helped us appreciate this skill, and there are historical reasons why. As film journalism developed in the l910s and 1920s, many of the best writers sought to prove that cinema was a distinct art, owing nothing of consequence to theater. Film staging seemed “<span>theatrical</span>”, whereas the emerging technique of editing seemed “<span>purely cinematic</span>”. Thanks to editing, the filmmaker could flash us from one locale to another, skip over stretches of time, draw metaphorical comparisons, and generate a rhythm purely out of shots of changing lengths. Small wonder that the most thoughtful critics, as well as the most imaginative theorists, usually preached the virtues of cutting and ignored staging. It took another generation of critics, those who grew up with the sound cinema, to try to right the balance. But their revolution was an unfinished one. To this day critics praise a virtuoso piece of editing while remaining oblivious to far more subtle and powerful passages of staging. Some film theorists call cutting “<span>invisible</span>”, but for both ordinary moviegoers and film experts, cinematic staging remains a truly imperceptible art.</p>
        <p>Which means that we are very far from understanding the robust artistic resources of staging- driven cinema. In Hong’s drinking scene the filmmaker uses small glances, gestures, and changes of position to give the sustained shot a dramatic arc. There is suspense as we wait for a character’s reaction, surprise when a new piece of information comes to light in the frame. There is also the gradation of emphasis, the possibility that secondary aspects of the image can reinforce or play off the major action. A shot can also develop its own distinct expressive dimensions (lassitude, melancholy, or delicacy) and its own pacing (fleet or lugubrious).</p>
        <p>More strikingly, the most adept filmmakers in this tradition exploit all these possibilities while showing that one need not forfeit some of the resources of cutting. The cutting/staging dichotomy is too coarse to be of great critical use. Admittedly, directors working in the tradition with which I’m concerned have found ingenious equivalents for close-ups and cut-ins. But editing can cooperate, in subtle ways, with the sustained shot and the dense image. Indeed, a sustained shot gives the cut a particular saliency, as the change of shot can be reserved for maximum effect. Very often, patterns of staging are bound up with patterns of editing.</p>
        <p>This book’s central question, then, is, What aesthetic possibilities emerge when cinematic staging is employed in such ways? This is not exactly to ask about acting or ensemble performance, although both impinge on the phenomenon I’m considering.<sup>11</sup> So, too, does camerawork, particularly the act of framing. Perhaps Eisenstein captures the idea best in speaking of mise-en-shot, the presentation of an action through the film image. Mise-enshot is at once theatrical, involving staging, and pictorial, since the screen, like a painting, presents the viewer with a framed vertical plane. By analyzing mise-en-shot I hope to disclose a treasury of quite fine-grained options, some so delicate that they normally escape our notice.</p>
        <p>The impulse for this inquiry stems from my earlier book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On the History of Film Style</em>. That was an exploration of the historiography of style, and in the last chapter I sketched a history of staging in depth that sought to avoid some of the drawbacks of earlier accounts . That chapter tried to show that we can usefully consider film techniques as solutions to concrete problems of representation and that filmmakers inherit many solutions from the trial-and- error efforts of their predecessors. In thinking further about the ways one could move actors around the frame, I was drawn to examine four filmmakers who worked in the staging- centered tradition. So I decided to examine in detail the staging strategies of Louis Feuillade, a master of silent- cinema storytelling; Kenji Mizoguchi, melodramatist of Japan; Theo Angelopoulos, the Greek filmmaker who synthesizes several features of European modernism; and Hou Hsiao-hsien, who explored staging strategies within a Taiwanese context. Far from merely illustrating my earlier account, however, the study of these directors reveals that the tradition is even more supple and subtle than I had realized. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Figures Traced in Light</em>, then, not only offers concrete illustrations of ideas proposed in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On the History of Film Style</em>; it also refines and extends them.</p>
        <p>Certainly we could learn from scrutinizing many other filmmakers, from the 1910s masters through Keaton, Dreyer, and Eisenstein and on to Chantal Akerman, Otar Iosseliani, and Bela Tarr. I select my quartet because they both exemplify some typical norms and display some unusual exploitations of them. By focusing on a few outstanding exponents of the style we won’t exhaust it, but we can probe certain possibilities in depth. I confess, as well, that I was drawn to less-examined figures . There’s still a lot to say about Renoir, for example, but his staging has been studied a good deal more than that of Mizoguchi, who is no less great a director. Of course, these four directors are not exactly unknowns. Feuillade is by common consent one of the most important directors of the 1910s, and critical opinion of Mizoguchi could hardly be higher. Angelopoulos and Hou have both backers and detractors, but if critical acclaim counts for anything, they are among the half-dozen most-praised directors working today. The fact that these directors’ works are for the most part unavailable in adequate video copies says less about their stature than about the tastes of the market.</p>
        <p>All that granted, though, this is not a set of auteur essays; there are many aspects of each director’s technique and worldview that I set aside. Indeed, by looking at how these filmmakers exploit and explore traditions of staging, we open our inquiry to matters not usually broached in auteur studies. Chapter 2’s examination of Feuillade also shows that many silent- era filmmakers revealed dazzling resources in the fixed shot. Considering Mizoguchi (chapter 3) not only demands that we consider the Japanese filmmaking context but also raises is sues of how certain staging strategies became integrated with sound filming and camera movement. In chapter 4 I treat Angelopoulos as a figure who synthesizes trends of the 1950s and 1960s, bending certain options to the purposes of austere modernism. A study of Hou Hsiao-hsien (chapter 5) allows us to examine how kindred stylistic options became a defining feature of Asian filmmaking.</p>
        <p>Apart from tracing an important and somewhat neglected line of film artistry, I have other goals in view. Most abstractly, I hope to show the viability of a poetics of cinema, the study of how films work (narratively, stylistically) to shape the audience’s experience. Cinematic staging offers a rich repertory of techniques that answer nicely to analysis from the standpoint of poetics. I don’t intend to make this examination of “<span>cinepoetics</span>” a dry treatise, however; I hope that this book will further film appreciation for the interested moviegoer. Most scholars concerned with particular films have concentrated on interpreting them at a fairly high level of generality. The scrutiny of style that is commonplace in art history or musicology has still not become well established in film studies. In particular, film scholars have not helped viewers appreciate what Svetlana Alpers and Michael Baxandall have called “<span>pictorial intelligence</span>”.<sup>12</sup> The demand is all the more pressing in that filmmakers expend enormous energies on making things look a certain way and not others . A poetics of cinema can make us more sensitive to the films we see, encouraging us to recognize the skill, and sometimes the brilliance, of the people who make them. The study of cinematic staging is an ideal way to achieve just this sensitivity. Once we start to look closely at even a simple scene like Hong’s drinking bout, our awareness of filmmaking craft and the capacities of the medium deepens. Most optimistically, I hope that filmmakers-particularly young ones-will here learn about traditions flagrantly ignored in most movies on view today.</p>
        <p>Several thinkers have laid a foundation for understanding the traditions with which I am concerned. The central figure is the great French critic and theorist Andre Bazin, who formulated a conception of cinema based on the photographic properties of the medium, its ability to record events in continuous space and time. In tracing out a history of film style Bazin distinguished between “<span>directors who put their faith in the image</span>” and “<span>directors who put their faith in reality</span>”. Image-based directors built their style around painterly manipulations of the image (such as in German Expressionism) or juxtapositions of images (such as the intellectual montage of Soviet filmmakers). By contrast, directors who put their faith in reality made cinematic art out of certain phenomenal features of the world, such as temporal continuity and spatial adjacency. Bazin believed that F . W. Murnau, Jean Renoir, Orson Welles, William Wyler, and the Italian neorealists built very different styles out of cinema’s power to capture the concrete relations of people and objects knit into the seamless fabric of reality.<sup>13</sup></p>
        <p>Bazin’s writings of the 1940s and 1950s furnish us a generous array of analytical concepts, most notably bearing on certain techniques that earlier aestheticians had neglected: the long take, camera movement, and composition in depth (<em>profondeur de champ</em>). The reality-based directors tended to rely on these techniques, rather than editing and close-ups, to capture the spatiotemporal continuity of the world in which we live. Very shortly, though, Bazin found his preferred techniques championed by a slightly younger generation of critics in love with Hollywood. To Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Franc;:ois Truffaut, and other writers at <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinema</em>, a filmmaker’s respect for reality was less important than an ability to create expressive artifice. Bazin’s key filmmakers , such as Murnau and Renoir, became stepfathers to Nicholas Ray, George Cukor, Otto Preminger, and above all Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks . These Hollywood directors also knew how to use long takes, camera movement, and composition in depth but not principally as a way of capturing phenomenal reality; now the techniques were vehicles for each director’s unique conception of the world. These were auteurs, presenting their personal visions on film, and their chief means of doing so was something called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em>.</p>
        <p>Few terms in film aesthetics are as polyvalent as this one. In French it chiefly means what we in English call “<span>direction</span>”, and its sources lie in the theater. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mettre en scene</em> is to “<span>arrange the action onstage</span>”, and it implies controlling performance, lighting, setting, costume, and the like. Since Bazin, some French critics have treated mise -en-scene as simply the entire process of directing a film, including everything from staging to editing and adding music. But the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> critics tended to narrow the term: following Bazin, they counterposed mise-en-scene to editing (conceived as either aggressive montage or more standardized continuity cutting). A mise-en-scene director tended to avoid cutting, creating significance and emotion chiefly by means of what happened within each shot.</p>
        <p>The young critics pushed beyond Bazin, treating mise-en-scene as both process and product. Mise-en-scene comprised all the factors that the director could control during shooting-the performances, the blocking, the lighting, the placement of the camera. Thus Hollywood directors, who may not have worked on the film’s script and might have no say in editing, could still decisively shape the film at the mise-en-scene phase. The term also referred to the result onscreen: the way the performers fitted into the frame, the way the action exfoliated over time. Alexandre Astruc, a contemporary of Bazin’s who was an important influence on the younger critics, noted: “<span>We have come to realize that the meaning which the silent cinema tried to give birth to through symbolic association exists within the image itself, in the development of the narrative, in every gesture of the characters, in every line of dialogue, in those camera movements which relate objects to objects and characters to objects</span>”.<sup>14</sup> For Frarncois Truffaut, mise-en-scene comprised “<span>the camera position, the angle selected, the shot’s length, an actor’s gesture</span>”, in sum, “<span>at once the story that is being told and the manner of telling it</span>”.<sup>15</sup> ( See box.)</p>
        <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> critics celebrated Rossellini, Visconti, Cocteau, Bresson, Tati, and other European filmmakers, but their most controversial strictures on mise - en-scene were provoked by American studio films. Some critics argued that Hollywood resembled a Renaissance capital, where experienced craftsmen pooled their talents to create brilliant art.<sup>16</sup> At the same time, the technological innovations of color and widescreen seemed to favor spreading out bodies and objects within an all- encompassing space. “<span>Yes</span>”, remarked Rivette, “<span>ours is the generation of CinemaScope, the generation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">metteurs en scene</em> finally worthy of the name: moving the creatures of our mind around the unlimited stage of the universe</span>”.<sup>17</sup> Above all, an auteur’s work yielded to the sort of thematic interpretation that had proven valid for literature.<sup>18</sup> Mise-en-scene became a vehicle of abstract meaning; if Sartre had shown that every style conceals a metaphysic, then it was possible to see Hawks and Hitchcock as conveying profound thoughts about human conduct.</p>
        <p>A rival school, centered around the magazine <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Presence du cinema</em> (1959-1967), objected to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em>’ canon but celebrated the powers of mise- en-scene in an even more delirious fashion. Michel Mourlet was the head of the MacMahonists, so called because of the theater the group frequented. Mourlet’s 1959 manifesto, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Sur un art ignore</span>”, reiterated Bazin’s conception of cinema as an art based in recording and pushed to a limit certain <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> writers’ belief that the cinema was destined to be a “<span>classical</span>” art. For Mourlet flagrant editing, bizarre camera angles, and strained lighting effects ran against film’s inherent bias toward transparent rendering. Cahiers favorites like Hitchcock and Welles, even Hawks, relied too much on tricks of camerawork and cutting. “<span>The arrangement of actors and obj ects, their displacements within the frame-this must express everything</span>”.<sup>19</sup> Fritz Lang, Preminger, and very few others had mastered that sober lucidity that could hypnotize the spectator by gestures, looks, and “<span>the tiniest movements of faces and bodies</span>”.<sup>20</sup></p>
        <p>The broader Cahiers conception passed into US film culture during the 1960s, when Andrew Sarris argued for the worth of mise-en-scene, a technique that placed “<span>the emphasis on the spectacle itself rather than on the dialectical relationship of separate shots and images</span>”.<sup>21</sup> In Britain the journal <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sequence</em> (1946-1952) had disseminated some ideas resembling Bazin’s, but it was the critics around <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Movie</em> magazine ( founded 1962) who pioneered the detailed analysis and interpretation of mise-en-scene.<sup>22</sup> The essays and monographs of Robin Wood were perhaps the most influential work in this vein, although the earliest in- depth study by a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Movie</em> critic would seem to be Ian Cameron’s probing 1962 essay on Antonioni.<sup>23</sup> In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Film as Film</em> (1972), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Movie’s</em> V. F. Perkins put mise-en-scene firmly at the center of cinematic artistry: “<span>The director’s most significant area of control is over what happens <em>within</em> the image</span>”.<sup>24</sup></p>
        <p>The tastes of mise -en-scene critics varied somewhat. Rohmer found in Murnau the perfect model of a style that blended a respect for natural appearances with the sort of idealization found in classical art. Rivette championed Hawks and Rossellini, who put the serenely poised body at the center of the mise-en-scene. The MacMahonists created a very diverse canon, ranging alongside Lang, Preminger, and Mizoguchi Kenji directors like Joseph Losey, Cecil B. DeMille, Ida Lupino, and Vittorio Cottafavi (perhaps best known for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hercules Conquers Atlantis</em>, 1961). The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Movie</em> critics, who could wring a dense page of analysis out of the first shot of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marnie</em>, sought films that created the sort of intricate implication that literary critics found in John Donne or Wallace Stevens. Sarris was more mystical, finally at a loss to define <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> except through a hallucinatory rapture. Watching a little-known Mizoguchi film without subtitles at the Museum of Modern Art, he was swept away:</p>
        <blockquote>Then at the end the beleaguered heroine walks to a restaurant on a hillside overlooking the sea, and she orders something from a waiter in white, and the camera is high overhead, and the morning mists are bubbling all around, and the camera follows the waiter as he walks across the terrace to the restaurant and then follows him back to the heroine’s table now magically, mystically empty. It is as if death had intervened in the interval of two camera movements, to and fro, and the bubbling mists and the puzzled waiter provide the Orphic overtones of the most magical <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> since the last deathly images of Mumau’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tabu</em>.<sup>25</sup></blockquote>
        <p>Despite differences in taste, however, most critics treated mise-en-scene as a knowing yet natural deployment of figures before the camera. Many still do. Thierry Jousse reminded 1994 readers that all the recent talk about crafting tight screenplays should not obscure the deciding factor: “<span>Parallel to the dramatic construction of the plot, which can be written down, there is a whole technique, or rather an art, of impregnation, of the directing of bodies, of choreography, of the occupation of space, of natural movement which remains irreducible to the script</span>”.<sup>26</sup> And in 2000 a brigade of French reviewers, when asked to explain what mise-en-scene meant to them, responded that it centered on how the human figure is displayed across time and space. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mise-en-scene</em>, says one, is a demiurgic will to control the entire space of a film, the quest for a perfectly adequate image.<sup>27</sup></p>
        <p>The concept of cinematic staging, as I’ll be using it in the pages that follow, has undeniable links to the idea of mise - en-scene, and the critical tradition I’ve just reviewed has informed my thinking in ways that should be apparent. Several of my points about Hong Sang-soo’s drinking scene owe a lot to Bazin, especially his emphasis on the dramatic advantages of presenting two pieces of information to us simultaneously.<sup>28</sup> Nonetheless, it’s worth briefly signaling some distinctions I’ll be drawing.</p>
        <p>Proponents of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> aesthetics seldom distinguish among aspects of it, but we can. I take the core technical sense of the term to denote setting, lighting, costume, makeup, and performance within the shot. Some critics would also include camera movement as an element of mise-en-scene, but I think that it’s best to keep it as an independent variable; it’s really a feature of cinematography, the manipulation of the camera, rather than a feature of what is filmed. Three of my directors coordinated camera movement with “<span>mise-en-shot</span>”.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the prototype of a mise-en-scene image is usually assumed to be a longtake shot exhibiting great depth of field. To be sure, many of my analyses will concentrate on just such images, but we capture the complexities of filmmaking practice most fully by teasing out these techniques along distinct and graduated dimensions. So, for instance, instead of counterposing long takes to brief shots, we should keep in mind that shots can be presented in any duration, from one twenty-fourth of a second to a dozen minutes or more. More pertinent are the shot-length norms relevant for any particular period or group style. Along another dimension, the framing can be close or distant, and there’s no reason to assume that long shots must run long and close -ups must be cut fast. Ingmar Bergman’s films often feature prolonged close -ups ( Fig. 1.27). Depth compositions can be found in short shots or long takes, distant framings or medium shots (as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Virgin Stripped Bare</em> . . . ) or even close framings (Fig. 1.28). Rohmer claims that if actors aren’t on two or more planes, “<span>there is no real <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise en scene</em>, no deeper meaning</span>”,<sup>29</sup> but we should acknowledge the artistic resources of lateral staging, even if it displays minimal depth (Fig. 1.29). Further, our impression of depth is built out of many spatial features, and these can vary independently, creating significantly different patterns of staging.</p>
        <p>Deep or shallow, cinematic staging relies on a perspectival projection of space. That proj ection is most evident in photographic media, but it’s also attainable through nonphotographic means-in classical painting and, most obviously for us today, in digital image-making. All the artistic resources of cinematic staging are in principle attainable in animation or computer-generated imagery, as long as the process retains the perspectival projection characteristic of camera lenses (Fig. 1.30). Here I part company with Bazin and the Cahiers critics: the cinematic image yields a perspectival projection, but that projection need not record a preexisting world.</p>
        <p>Once a film’s staging no longer need capture an independent space and time, we can’t judge artistic value on grounds of faithfulness to reality. In some film movements, as in the New Taiwanese Cinema of the 1980s, the long take was indeed felt to be a blow struck for realism, but even in that school it yielded other advantages. In the chapters to come I’ll touch on several of these: the ways in which staging can guide our attention across a complex visual field, play hide-and-seek with our expectations, summon up expressive qualities like delicacy or dynamism, and participate in a broader narrative patterning. Writers who admire mise-en-scene tend to look on editing as intrusive and heavy-handed, but I’ll often have occasion to show how staging and editing cooperate. In a context dominated by long takes, cuts take on great importance, and many a depth-oriented director has used editing to maintain or transform spatial relations in the course of a scene.</p>
        <p>In this respect my approach is close to that articulated by Sergei Eisenstein in his writings and teachings of the 1930s. Although Eisenstein will always be associated with concepts of montage, he also studied staging in unprecedented detail. He distinguished among <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em>, the arrangement of the action as if on a theater stage; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-cadre</em> (“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-shot</span>”), the staging within the frame of the image; and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</em>, the sequencing of shots . For Eisenstein all worked together to communicate the story situation and to heighten its expressive impact. Of particular interest to us is Eisenstein’s 1933 discussion of staging in depth. He required his pupils at the USSR Film School to stage the scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Crime and Punishment</em> in which Raskolnikov murders the old pawnbroker. He added a crucial proviso: it had to be filmed in one shot and from a fixed camera position. Ten years before Bazin celebrated <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane’s profondeur de champ</em> as “<span>a dialectical step forward in the history of film language</span>”,<sup>30</sup> Eisenstein was working out an intricate Wellesian’ approach to staging-from the standpoint not of photographic realism but of dynamic storytelling and spectatorial effect. With his students Eisenstein decided to bring the action steadily toward the viewer. Raskolnikov erratically follows his victim forward (Fig. 1.31), and when he strikes her, knocking her out of the frame, her hands fly up in the foreground (Fig. 1.32).<sup>31</sup></p>
        <p>Perhaps Eisenstein’s speculations on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-cadre</em> were influenced by an equally provocative proposal from his contemporary and teacher Lev Kuleshov. In 1929 Kuleshov pointed out that because the film image results from a perspectival projection, the playing space constituted a pyramid tipped on its side, the point resting at the camera lens. In the engineering spirit that characterized his thinking Kuleshov proposed that this pyramid could be treated as a “<span>metrical spatial web</span>”, marked off at intervals that could specify any point in the height, width, and depth of the space. An actor might move her hand from, say, point 62/44/32 to point 82/47/38. It’s a startling anticipation of the 3-D coordinates used to plot volumes and positions in computer-generated imagery, and like Eisenstein, Kuleshov contributed to a vein of thinking about mise-en-scene not as photographic recording but as purely spatial manipulation within a projective geometry.<sup>32</sup></p>
        <p>We can trace the problem one more step back. Before the Bolshevik Revolution turned Kuleshov into a Soviet filmmaker, he worked as a set designer and actor with Yevgenii Bauer, one of the greatest Tsarist directors. Bauer would have been acutely aware of that visual pyramid that Kuleshov imagined mapping so meticulously. In the 1910s, before Hollywood’s continuity editing came to dominate European cinema, most directors staged their scenes in long, fairly distant takes. Directors were obliged to explore, however intuitively, the possibilities inherent in the unedited image, and that meant understanding the perspectival constraints of the camera eye. Take yet another dinner-table scene, this one from Bauer’s last film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Revolutionary</em> (1917).</p>
        <p>At breakfast the old father who has suffered under Tsarist repression is sitting on the far right, with his brother turned from us and his daughter facing us in the center (Fig. 1.33). The son enters and kisses his father (Fig. 1.34) before kissing his uncle (Fig. 1.35) and sitting down on frame left, opposite the old man (Fig. 1.36). The father, who has just read about a Russian victory in the world war, passes the newspaper to his son through the shot’s central zone (Fig. 1.37). As the son reads the news, the daughter leans aside to read with him, blocked out by the uncle and the samovar on the table (Fig. 1.38). Now there is nothing to distract us from studying the son’s reaction. He folds up the paper and passes it back (Fig. 1.39), and a dialogue title gives us his response: “<span>But our party is against continuing the war</span>”. The father looks at the uncle, who turns in a three - quarter view like that of an “<span>over-the-shoulder</span>” shot in conventional editing (Fig. 1.40). The uncle, dismissing the boy’s naivete with a wave of his hand, rotates fully away from us, and again the daughter is blocked (Fig. 1.41). The father rises and kisses his daughter (Fig. 1.42), then goes over to collect his son (Fig. 1.43), who rises and goes out with him (Fig. 1.44). The tension has abated; the difference of political opinion isn’t a problem-a fact signaled by the daughter, still in the center, who moves out from behind the samovar to smile over her teacup (Fig. 1.45).</p>
        <p>Kuleshov completed <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Revolutionary</em> after Bauer’s death, so we cannot be sure who directed this sequence. Still, it offers a vivid example of the practical resources yielded by the camera’s monocular vision. The gradation of emphasis is clear. The staging presents the two principal characters as potential antagonists, facing each other at opposite ends of the table, with the daughter as a secondary observer and the turned-away uncle as of least importance. At crucial moments the uncle and the samovar block the daughter in frame center so that we may concentrate on the two maj or players at either end of the table. Everyone’s position and movements could be plotted on a “<span>metric spatial web</span>”, but the practical director need know only that in the absence of editing the camera-eye’s limitations can also become strengths. This is why our study of staging can profitably start with early film and concentrate on Feuillade and other ingenious 1910s directors. It was in those years that filmmakers realized, however intuitively, that the power to see everything is meaningless unless at certain moments we notice only the most important thing.</p>
        <blockquote>I’d love to see directors not shoot so many close-ups. I’d love to see directors start trusting the audience to be the film editor with their eyes, the way you are sometimes with a stage play, where the audience selects who they would choose to look at while a scene is being played, with two characters, four characters, six characters. There’s so much cutting and so many close-ups being shot today . . . . It’s too easy for filmmakers. It’s very easy to put somebody up against a wall and shoot a close-up, and they say the words and you go on to the next shot. Steven Spielberg<sup>33</sup></blockquote>
        <p>In the 1950s Bazin and his young colleagues could talk o f American cinema as one of the strongholds of subtle cinematic staging. By and large that’s no longer the case. The technique on display in today’s Hollywood film is so at odds with that of Bauer or Hong Sang-soo or even Hawks that these filmmakers look eccentric or old-fashioned. The stylistic strategies on which this book concentrates quietly challenge today’s most widespread habits of making and watching movies.</p>
        <p>Despite critics’ complaint that movies are packed with chases, explosions, and gun battles, the standard scene remains a conversation. These scenes are dominated by two staging norms, what practitioners call “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">stand-and-deliver</span>” and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">walk-and-talk</span>”. Both flourished in classical studio cinema as well, but between these extremes there was also the choreography found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Girl Friday</em> (see box, pp. 14-15). Today this midrange blend has almost completely vanished. Instead, filmmakers have developed tactics of editing and camerawork that enliven static dialogue or conversations on the go.</p>
        <p>In the stand-and- deliver approach, which may turn into a sit-and-deliver approach, the characters are shown taking up positions, usually in a master shot. An axis of action governs the actors’ orientations and eyelines, and the shots, however varied in angle, are taken from one side of the axis. Actors’ movements are matched across cuts. As the scene develops, the shots tend to get closer to the performers, carrying us to the heart of the drama. Analytical editing presents shot/reverse shots, over-the-shoulder angles, and singles-all the coverage required by long-standing premises of classical continuity editing. When characters change position within the space, a new establishing shot gives us the information.</p>
        <p>Whatever variants or alternatives we might find, these schemas remain default values for most filmmakers . “<span>If all else fails</span>”, Ron Howard tells a neophyte director, “<span>shoot a master and shoot overs [over-the-shoulder shots] and singles</span>”.<sup>34</sup> The same advice could have been given in 1925. The crucial difference is that by the 1930s a scene like Hawks’s from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Girl Friday</em> could integrate analytical editing with intricate choreography. In contemporary cinema the stand-and- deliver strategy dominates. Having fixed their players in place, filmmakers dynamize the dialogue through specific devices of cutting and cinematography. We can call this new style, which emerged in the early 1960s and became dominant by the 1980s, <em>intensified</em> continuity.<sup>35</sup></p>
        <p>Early in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em> (1996) the hero and heroine “<span>meet cute</span>” at an airport luggage terminal. Dorothy is with her son, Ray, and they’ve traveled on the same flight with Jerry. Dorothy is an accountant in the sports agency where Jerry works, and she’s been moved by his “<span>mission statement</span>” proposing that the agency start to give clients more personal attention. The scene opens with a distraught Dorothy calling for Ray, who has run off. Jerry offers to help and spots Ray riding on the luggage conveyor belt. After Dorothy has retrieved her son, she tells Jerry how inspiring she found his memo. His ego, and perhaps his libido, aroused, Jerry stays to talk with her. He’s about to offer her a ride home when her sister arrives and Jerry depart.</p>
        <p>The scene brings the couple face -to-face for the first time and lays down the terms of their relationship. Jerry is vain, self-absorbed, and irresolute; although he likes taking credit for his mission statement on sports agenting, he’s prepared to disavow it. Earlier, after writing it, he had tried to withdraw it for fear that it would damage his career. When he’s fired and suffers the hard knocks of freelancing, he’ll be tempted to abandon the ideals he championed. Dorothy believes more unswervingly in those ideals than Jerry does, and she’s attracted to him, as she’ll admit later, partly because of “<span>the man he almost is</span>”. Moreover, in the film’s opening Jerry has been presented as having a special fondness for children. As he and Dorothy talk in the airport, each clasps one of Ray’s hands, and the boy swings carelessly between them, prefiguring the role he will play in drawing Jerry into marrying Dorothy; in the film’s epilogue, as the couple return from the zoo with Ray, he swings on their arms between them.</p>
        <p>The airport scene is edited classically. After an establishing shot (Fig. 1.46), the first phase deals with Dorothy’s finding Ray with Jerry’s help. In this portion of the scenethe couple’s dialogue is handled in over-the-shoulder medium shots (Figs . 1.47-1.48). Just as Jerry tells her where Ray is (riding the luggage conveyor), the conversation is underscored by a shift to tight close-ups (Figs. 1.49-1.50). This passage establishes their bonding around the boy, the force that will later hold their marriage together. Dorothy then scolds Ray for running off (“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">You scared me!</span>”), an act that reconfirms her as a concerned but harried mother trying to enforce discipline (Figs. 1.51-1.52). Jerry says good-bye, but Dorothy’s calling, “<span>I loved your memo!</span>” after him brings him back to take some more credit (Figs. 1.53-1.54).</p>
        <p>The next phase of the scene presents Dorothy’s admiration and Jerry’s self-absorption, played out in orthodox eyeline -matched reverse shots (Figs. 1.55-1.56). These framings are about as close as those seen earlier, but there are many more of them here, signaling the development of the romance. Often in classical scenes, as the drama proceeds to its core issues, the characters become more prominent. At one point a broader three-shot is introduced, but that’s to accommodate Ray’s swinging between the couple (Fig. 1.57); soon enough we’re back to dialogue in tight close -ups. When Dorothy’s sister, Eileen, arrives, offscreen at first, Jerry leaves, followed in a long-lens medium shot (Fig. 1.58). The scene ends with Dorothy and Ray embracing and looking off (Fig. 1.59), leaving us to expect further romantic developments.<sup>36</sup></p>
        <p>This sequence isn’t as galvanizing as a full-tilt car chase-supposedly the prototype of today’s Hollywood-but it’s more typical. Most scenes in commercial movies (and TV shows) are staged, shot, and cut as this conversation is. In stand-and- deliver passages like this, the visual interest springs not from complex staging but from techniques of editing and camerawork. The scene moves through sixty-seven shots in three and a half minutes, yielding an average shot length of only 3.2 seconds. This figure points up a notable shift in the classical style. From the coming of sound to about 1960, most Hollywood feature films contained between three hundred and seven hundred shots, yielding a range of average shot lengths (hereafter ASLs) falling between eight and eleven seconds.<sup>37</sup> Since the 1960s, cutting rates have steadily accelerated, with typical 1970s ASLs running five to nine seconds and 1980s ASLs running three to eight seconds. The 1990s set a still faster pace, with several films containing more than two thousand shots and AS Ls ranging from two to eight seconds . As one would expect, action films led the way, but at the century’s end the typical film in any genre, even romantic comedies like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shakespeare in Love</em> (1998) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Runaway Bride</em> (1999), had an ASL of between four and six seconds. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em>, with its nearly two thousand cuts, averages 4.1 seconds per shot.</p>
        <p>Faster cutting, however, didn’t lead Hollywood films toward the discontinuities of Soviet silent montage. By and large, as in our Jerry Maguire example, editing simply accelerates the pace of scenes presented in ordinary ways. Instead of three or four reverse shots we might get ten or twelve, with each line or facial reaction assigned a separate shot. The premises of spatial continuity still govern the way the scene is staged, shot, and edited. Indeed, the greater number of shots strengthens the reliance on classical continuity principles; because each shot is so brief, it needs to be more redundant in indicating who is where, who is speaking to whom, who has changed position, and so on. Reciprocally, stand-and-deliver staging allowed directors to cut faster, since positions could be taken for granted.</p>
        <p>Directors also intensified continuity principles through more close framings and singles. The sequence from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em> is characteristic. It contains only four long shots , and two of those become closer views when a character moves into them. The opening shot establishes the luggage terminal very briefly before Dorothy steps into the foreground and the camera starts to follow her search for Ray (Fig. 1.46). The scene relies on singles: two-thirds of the shots show only one of the three characters . In addition, the long lenses tend to tum even somewhat distant framings into singles (Fig. 1.53 ). As a result, there are twenty-two waist-up or chest-up medium shots (for example, Fig. 1.48).</p>
        <p>Even more surprising, more than half of the scene’s shots are close-ups of Jerry, Dorothy, or Ray. The medium shot, once the workhorse of studio filmmaking, has been replaced by various degrees of close framings . Since our orienting view in the early phase of the scene is the over-the-shoulder medium shot (Figs . I.47-I.48), the only way to heighten emphasis is to move toward tight singles : of Jerry and Dorothy (Figs . 1.49-1.50), of Dorothy and Ray (Figs. 1.51-1.52), and of Dorothy and Jerry when they start warming to each other (Figs. 1.55-1.56 ). Even the singles in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Girl Friday</em> (for example, Fig. 1.22) are nothing like this. Continuity cutting has been rescaled and amped up, and the drama has been squeezed down to faces-particularly eyes and mouths. Only Ray’s play at the grownups’ knees makes use of the lower parts of the couple’s bodies. No wonder that most contemporary acting manuals assume that the performance is almost wholly a matter of voice and face.<sup>38</sup></p>
        <p>Such tight facial shots are typical of Hollywood cinema since the 1960s . In the 1930s and 1940s the baseline framing, what the French called the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">plan-americain</em> (‘‘American shot</span>”), tended to cut the figure off at the knees or midthigh, as in our <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Girl Friday</em> scene (Figs. 1.20, 1.26). Many directors built their scenes out of prolonged two-shots in a midrange framing, a scale well-suited to the squarish 1.33:1 aspect ratio (Fig. 1. 60). In the late 1950s and early 1960s filmmakers began to rely more on closer views, despite the fact that virtually every movie was shown in a widescreen format. Filmmakers working in the somewhat wide ratio of 1.85:1 had little trouble fitting close-ups into the shot; in effect many shots in the new ratio simply masked off the top and bottom of shots framed in the 1.33 format, leaving less headroom and occasionally cropping out foreheads and chins.</p>
        <p>The wider anamorphic formats like CinemaScope (2.35:1) at first seemed to favor more distant framings, and many directors dotted the frame with bodies and decor-sometimes awkwardly, like clothes hanging on a line (Fig. 1. 61). Many believed that 2.35:1 format rendered the close -up obsolete; 1950s anamorphic lenses often distorted facial shots anyhow (creating “<span>CinemaScope mumps</span>”). By the 1960s, though, thanks largely to innovations introduced by the Panavision company, close -ups and even extreme close-ups became feasible in anamorphic and wide-film formats (Fig. 1. 62).<sup>39</sup> Surprisingly, the wide image could incline a director toward getting closer to the actors. Close views did not slice faces free of their surroundings, since directors could now include a lot of setting even in fairly tight framings (Fig. 1. 63). Moreover, the 2.35 aspect ratio posed a problem with full-length shots; if you wanted to show the actor’s body you’d have to get back quite far or leave large empty areas. “<span>What pulled me into shooting close-ups</span>”, Steven Spielberg remarks, “<span>was when I shifted to the widescreen format</span>”.<sup>40</sup></p>
        <p>Medium shots and close -ups of individual actors were common in silent cinema, but in the sound era, when two-shots carried the burden of many scenes, a cut-in to a single could carry considerable force. ( See Figs. 1.21-1.22.) As rapid cutting developed in the 1960s, filmmakers broke conversation scenes into many close views , and today these scenes are built out of singles. Singles allow the editor to vary the scene’s pace and to pick the best bits of each actor’s performance.<sup>41</sup> And since singles constrain the directors’ choice about framing, we shouldn’t be surprised to find filmmakers working along that narrower scale from medium shot to extreme close-up. The filmmaker doesn’t foreswear long shots altogether, of course, but they can be fewer and briefer, as in our <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em> scene. Now a long shot can serve as punctuation; it can demarcate phases of the action or provide that striking visual beat that close-ups no longer muster.</p>
        <p>The airport meet-cute in Jerry Maguire carries yet another lesson in intensified continuity. Nearly every shot is filmed with a long lens-even the over-the-shoulder shots (Figs. i.47-i.48 ). Those shots not filmed with a long lens are given a slightly grotesque bulge with a wide-angle treatment (Figs. 1.51-1.52). This polar opposition between long and short focal lengths became marked in the 1960s, when filmmakers wanted to retain the expressive resources of Hollywood’s wide-angle tradition (associated with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane</em>) but also wanted to exploit the telephoto effects seen in European cinema. Studio-era filmmakers had reserved long lenses (75 mm and up) for making facial close-ups or following animals at a distance. By the 1970s, however, filmmakers were staging entire scenes for telephoto pickup, with rack focusing (shifting focus from one plane to another) becoming a common way to guide the viewer’s eye.</p>
        <p>Our sequence from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em> doesn’t exemplify every aspect of today’s Hollywood style. It doesn’t, for instance, display what we might call the free -ranging camera. Across most of the history of cinema, directors have had occasion to move the camera independently of the action, but today this technique has come to the fore to an unprecedented degree. The camera often tracks in or out from a figure, even in a shot/reverse-shot exchange (push in on A/push in on B/push in still closer on A/push in still closer on B , etc.). It spirals around the actors, as in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reservoir Dogs</em> scene (Figs. 1.9-1.1o). A sequence may start with an arcing or sidling movement past a foreground element, or the camera may crane down to meet the players.</p>
        <p>Stand-and-deliver is the most common staging option, but a second approach provides more dynamic figure movement. In the walk-and-talk option the characters are striding down the street, through an office, or along a corridor, usually toward the camera in a lengthy tracking shot. This was a stylistic signature of Max Ophuls and later Stanley Kubrick, but it was also common in Hollywood, especially for a film’s opening sequence (for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Scarface</em>, 1932; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ride the Pink Horse</em>, 1947; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Touch of Evil</em>, 1958). By the 1980s, thanks to auteurist film criticism and increasingly lightweight cameras and handheld supports, the prolonged following shot became de rigueur for nearly every film. Such shots, in which overcoming logistical tangles becomes an end in itself, may have been an effort to counterbalance the demands for fast-cut stand-and-deliver. It allowed cinephiliac filmmakers to flaunt a pluralistic style, a knowing synthesis of both “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>” and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</span>”.</p>
        <p>In either stand-and-deliver or walk-and-talk, long takes typically demand camera movement. When a scene is based on a “<span>sustained master</span>”, as in Woody Allen’s films or Spike Lee’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Do the Right Thing</em> (Figs. 1. 64-1.65), it’s usually a moving shot. Today’s Hollywood style is always on the move-if not through cutting, then through camerawork. What has gone almost completely unexplored is the unbudging long take. It can occasionally be found in 1960s and 1970s films (for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nashville</em>, 1975), but it became much rarer in the 1980s. Today perhaps the most radical thing you can do in Hollywood is put your camera on a tripod, set it a fair distance from the action, and let the whole scene play out.</p>
        <p>Where did this change in the continuity style come from? No one has yet traced its emergence in detail, but prime influences would surely include television techniques (which since the 1960s have relied on fast cutting and camera movement), the need to make a scene read well on TV monitors (so lots of close-ups), the influence of showy directors like Hitchcock and Leone, new technology (like the Steadicam and computer-based editing ), and changes in production routines (for example, the use of multiple cameras armed with long lenses). In all these respects, and probably others, responses to production demands created standardized practices , and those in turn supported stylistic trends. It is here, within the film community-where concrete problems must be solved and successful solutions tend to become models-that we often find the most precise explanations for changes in visual style.</p>
        <p>No style is without advantages, and the schemas of intensified continuity have been brilliantly exploited by Michael Mann, David Lynch, and others . The style has also had enormous influence across the world, particularly in the popular cinemas of Europe and East Asia. In Hong Kong directors like John Woo, Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam, and Johnnie To embellished the style by putting it at the service of local traditions of percussive movement and sensuous display. A Thai film like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nang Nak</em>, a Korean film like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shiri or Tell Me Something</em>, and a Japanese film like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Monday</em> (all 1999 releases) indicate that intensified continuity has become the default value for international mass-market cinema. Aspects of the style are on display in more prestigious products too; look, for instance, at the choppy telephoto close-ups and endlessly drifting camera of Jane Campion’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Portrait of a Lady</em> (1996). True, a few American independents like Woody Allen have favored longer shot lengths,<sup>42</sup> but most directors have assimilated other aspects of intensified continuity, as can be seen in such disparate products as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sex, lies, and videotape</em> (1989) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Happiness</em> (1998).<sup>43</sup></p>
        <p>More creatively, some independent filmmakers have subjected conventions of intensified continuity to unusual variations. Joel and Ethan Coen and Sam Raimi have exploited the style for grotesque effects, but others have made it serve storytelling in more austere ways. For example, Hal Hartley’s scenes are shot predominantly in medium shot and close-up (thus saving money on sets and lighting ), but the staging avoids the overcovered stand-and-deliver approach favored by Hollywood, moving closer to the elliptical close -ups in late Godard films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Detective</em> (1985). In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Simple Men</em> (1992) Bill, a hardened thief on the run, meets his ex-wife in a coffee shop and gives her money for their child. Hartley supplies no establishing shot, instead working with four shots (one very brief) in which characters’ faces move in and out of the frame and secondary figures are put offscreen (Figs . I.6 6-I.68). The result is a careful choreography-not of full bodies, as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Girl Friday</em>, but of faces and shoulders, which register changes in the drama through slight turns and deflected looks . In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em> the couple’s eyes lock, but Hartley’s scene is built out of partners turning away or glancing aside. These movements are recalled much later in the film, when Bill is drawn to another woman. Hartley now sets the faces in profile but twists the bodies away from one another, suggesting only a half-trusting intimacy (Fig. I.69).</p>
        <p>Most proponents of intensified continuity, however, aren’t interested in such austerity. By treating ordinary scenes with the sort of inflated technique once reserved for suspenseful climaxes and courtroom revelations , today’s director not only risks bombast but is obliged to raise the stakes. Now the real climaxes must be treated with ever more outre effects-slow-motion, smeared color, digital doodlings, crashing electronic chords. Too often intensified continuity turns style into Style (or STYLE).</p>
        <p>We can’t say we weren’t warned. Back i n the 1960s, American critics spotted strident technique in Kubrick, Kazan, Frankenheimer, and the two Sidneys, Lumet and J . Furie. Dwight MacDonald objected to movies that were “<span>overdirected</span>”, claiming that Tony Richardson was “<span>unable to compose a scene clearly in front of the camera and so [was] forced to overuse the close-up</span>”.<sup>44</sup> Andrew Sarris complained of Mike Nichols’s “<span>facile shock tactics</span>” and Richard Lester’s and John Schlesinger’s “<span>weakness for the immediate dick-effect at the expense of an overall conception</span>”.<sup>45</sup> Pauline Kael proved prophetic:</p>
        <blockquote>The shifting camera styles, the movement, and the fast cutting of a film like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Finian’s Rainbow</em>-one of the better big productions-are like the “<span>visuals</span>” of TV commercials, a disguise for static material, expressive of nothing so much as the need to keep you from getting bored and leaving. Men are now beginning their careers as directors by working on commercials-which, if one cares to speculate on it, may be almost a onesentence resume of the future of American motion pictures.<sup>46</sup></blockquote>
        <p>Nearly forty years later the pumped-up technique these critics protested against has become the norm, and like all norms it excludes some fruitful alternatives. One goal of this book is to remind us of those alternatives and to coax young filmmakers into exploring them.</p>
        <p>You may think I’ve dodged some obvious questions from the outset. Why should we inquire into style at all ? Isn’t content-the story, or the film’s larger significance-finally more important ? Why plunge into the formalistic niceties of lenses and shot lengths ? And even if style is worth studying, is concentrating on the concrete and practical decisions made by filmmakers the most fruitful way to do so? How, today’s film scholars might demand, can we “<span>theorize</span>” the study of style?</p>
        <p>Film style matters because what people call content comes to us in and through the patterned use of the medium’s techniques. Without performance and framing, lens length and lighting, composition and cutting, dialogue and music, we could not grasp the world of the story. Style is the tangible texture of the film, the perceptual surface we encounter as we watch and listen, and that surface is our point of departure in moving to plot, theme, feeling-everything else that matters to us. And since filmmakers devote painstaking care to fine points of style, we must dig into details . A comprehensive discussion of any film can’t stop only with style, but style should claim a lot of our attention.</p>
        <p>Yet most film scholars don’t analyze style, particularly visual style.<sup>47</sup> Ironically, as films have become more available for close analysis than ever, interest in stylistics has waned. Why? Partly because film studies has for some time attracted scholars of a literary turn of mind, more comfortable with hermeneutics than stylistics (which remains a minor discipline in literary studies). In addition, even scholars have difficulty attending to the minutiae of technique. As we watch a film, we absorb its images but seldom notice how they’re lit or composed. So critics and scholars find it more natural to talk about characters psychological development, about how the plot resolves its conflicts and problems, or about the film’s philosophical or cultural or political significance.</p>
        <p>Our neglect of images is probably tied to our habits of taking in the world. We move through life cheerfully unaware of all the complicated ways our perceptual systems sift and elaborate the information pouring in.<sup>48</sup> The acts of seeing and hearing are, as psychologists say, “<span>informationally encapsulated</span>”. Life has no pause, or rewind buttons, and we can’t stop to examine the mechanisms in our heads that deliver a three-dimensional world of objects and activities to us. For normal purposes this is all to the good. We evolved so as to act on the outputs of those mechanisms, and being aware of them could only slow us down in a world where seconds matter. Yet the habits of ordinary perception, easy and quick, offer little help when we want to understand how cinema works.</p>
        <p>Moreover, only a few disciplines, such as art history, have developed a vocabulary for analyzing how images create their effects . This vocabulary, inevitably a technical one, comes far less spontaneously to us than the language we use to describe characters and plot. Of agents and activities we know; our commonsense psychology has given us a plentiful repertory of ways of describing human action. Of composition and color and patterns of movement we can say much less. In particular, to study cinematic staging is to focus on issues that, for historical reasons, have received little attention even from students of cinema.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive and detailed theory of film style isn’t in the cards here, especially in the dwindling pages of this introduction. But I should offer a preview of this book’s treatment of two fundamental issues: How can we usefully describe and analyze film style? And how can we fruitfully explain its historical causes and consequences ? At almost every turn my answers can be challenged, and on some points they already have been. Rather than taking on criticisms in advance here, the final chapter reviews some major objections to this sort of analysis and offers some rebuttals. The reader is in a better position to appraise the criticisms, I think, if she or he has already seen what insights flow from pursuing this line of inquiry.</p>
        <p>This is primarily a book of film criticism, offering some tools for stylistic analysis. But no criticism works without some theoretical presuppositions, so I’ll briefly lay out the ones most important for this project. I will assume that style has four broad functions. First, it serves to <em>denote</em> a fictional or nonfictional realm of actions, agents, and circumstances. Just as in literature, the denotative function of film style governs a great dealthe description of settings and characters, the account given of their motives, the presentation of dialogue and movement. In storytelling cinema, the denotative functions of style are everywhere evident. Each shot presents a slice of space and a segment of time, a set of persons and places that we are to take as part of a fictional or nonfictional world. Jerry Maguire and Dorothy, Walter Burns and Hildy, Su-jeong and her friends, the breakfasts in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Revolutionary</em> and in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Simple Men</em>-all come to us courtesy of stylistic processes working in the denotative dimension. This quality is so basic to filmmaking that we’re inclined to take it for granted, but shortly I’ll argue that it should be central to any account of cinema stylistics.</p>
        <p>Style need not only denote concrete objects and persons; it can display <em>expressive</em> qualities too. A great deal of musical style is devoted to representing emotional states, such. as majesty, sprightliness, or menace. Abstract Expressionist paintings are often taken to represent turbulence or anxiety. In most films expressive qualities can be carried by light, color, performances, music; and certain camera movements, such as the blurry swirl that can express vertigo. There are many philosophical arguments about how expression works in the arts, but for my purposes one further distinction is helpful. We can distinguish between style <em>presenting</em> feelingful qualities (“<span>The shot exudes sadness</span>”) and <em>causing</em> feelings in the perceiver (“<span>The shot makes me sad</span>”). For the most part I will confine myself to the first dimension of expression, but there is no overlooking the power of style to “<span>infect</span>” the spectator with strong feelings.<sup>49</sup></p>
        <p>Style can yield more abstract, conceptual meanings as well; style, that is, can be <em class="notranslate" translate="no">symbolic</em>. In a painting, a (denoted) tree might also be a symbol of fecundity; the squished skull tipping into the foreground in Holbein’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ambassadors</em> may be a memento mori. Symbols in literature, like the sign of the staring eyeglasses in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Great Gatsby</em>, and in cinema, like the copulating jet planes at the beginning of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dr. Strangelove</em> (1964), work by the same principle, of suggesting more general or abstract meanings. Films may evoke symbolic implications through color schemes, lighting design, setting, and musical associations.</p>
        <p>Finally, in any medium style can work somewhat on its own. It creates discrete moments and broader patterns that engage us for their own sake, coaxing us to discover order or notice fine differences. Granting the term’s inadequacies, we might say that here style functions <em>decoratively</em>. Decoration, in this sense, asks us to apprehend the sheer pattern- making possibilities of the medium.<sup>50</sup> In addition, we think of decoration as ornamentation, as an application grafted onto some support. We decorate an apartment’s walls, or we decorate our bodies with tattoos. In storytelling films, style can be decorative in just this sense: the pattern making operates alongside or “<span>on top of</span>” other stylistic functions. In purely nonrepresentational films, style is sheer decoration, creating wholly abstract patterns. But since most films are representational, we may find decorative qualities added on, as when the filmmaker creates pure patterns while also denoting a world or conveying expressive states.</p>
        <p>We might consider decoration a matter of one-off moments, as when today’s crane shot weaves arabesques around a minor action. In this sense decoration seems to be a sign of the mannerism that some commentators celebrate in such directors as von Sternberg, Busby Berkeley, and Brian De Palma and that Kael, Sarris, and MacDonald faulted in 1960s Hollywood releases. I’d suggest, though, that decorative uses of style can also work in a more pervasive, systematic way.<sup>51</sup> What I’ve elsewhere called “<span>parametric narration</span>” can be thought of as a highly organized decorative stylistic execution.<sup>52</sup> Other arts can start from pure patterning and add other dimensions : the composer of a fugue will try to find an expressive melody, and Mondrian gave a denotative-expressive spin to one abstract painting by calling it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Broadway Boogie-Woogie</em>. By contrast, systematic use of decoration is pretty rare in cinema, partly because this art form is historically so tied to denotation. We ought, for this reason, to resort to decorative explanations of film style only after fully considering other functions.</p>
        <p>I’ve separated out these various functions for analytical purposes; in actual cases any particular technique can serve several functions at once. New Hollywood’s intensified continuity provides many instances. Intercutting the camera movements tracking in toward two stationary characters can be at once denotative (magnifying facial reactions), expressive (signaling a growing tension in the scene), and mildly decorative (creating a parallel repetition of the stylistic device). A passage of rapid editing can inform us that the pursuers are closing in on the hero and simultaneously express the excitement of the situation.</p>
        <p>The last examples suggest that any function of style can also yield a payoff in the viewer’s response. Naturally, expressing an emotion, through whatever technique, often triggers an appropriate emotional response in the viewer. If both picture and sound convey a character’s grief, we may be moved to pity. The combination of nearly hysterical performances, relentless forward tracks , and pulsating, threnodic musical phrases give <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Magnolia</em> (1999) an insistently anxious quality that seeks to work on the spectator quite viscerally. Less showily, a denotative use of style, simply presenting the twists and turns of the story, can arouse a range of reactions, from curiosity and suspense to melancholy and elation. Even the abstract pattern-making of decorative processes can build up frustration (why is this technique repeated when it doesn’t seem to have a representational purpose ?) and satisfaction (now I discern the overarching design). Style informs our experience of a film at many levels.</p>
        <blockquote>Generally speaking, in blocking and framing a shot, the most important thing is to make sure the audience is looking where you want them to look. You have to make sure they clearly understand the story point that is taking place, and that they grasp all of the pertinent information while sort of ignoring everything that’s not important. Short of force-feeding the issue by blacking out everything else in the frame or providing blinking arrows, this is primarily accomplished through shot-composition and careful blocking. Robert Zemeckis <sup>53</sup></blockquote>
        <p>All the foregoing provides only a rough characterization of style’s functions in cinema, but it allows us to begin analyzing cinematic staging. We can use the distinctions I’ve just outlined to suggest some priorities.</p>
        <p>First, denotation is the central function that style fulfills in virtually any representational film. This fact has probably made denotation hard to notice: critics have largely overrated the symbolic dimension and underrated the denotative one. In analyzing a film’s style, then, I propose that <em>our customary point of departure should be the denotative functions that style fulfills</em>. Moreover, in analyzing a narrative film we should hypothesize that <em>for the most part stylistic denotation serves to present the information most relevant to the ongoing story</em>. All other things being equal, film style typically operates as part of na,rration, the process of cueing and guiding us to construct a story out of what is presented on the screen and on the sound track.<sup>54</sup> Of course, that construction may be creatively blocked through ellipses, concealment, misdirection, and the like (themselves all narrational maneuvers manifested through style). It would be more exact to say that the film encourages us to construct the story along certain preferred pathways. And that construction will take place in and through stylistic patterning.</p>
        <p>Not every technique in a film will have primarily denotative functions. The premises serve as default values and working hypotheses to guide our inquiry; being alert to them doesn’t keep us from noticing other matters. In many cases, once we have determined the denotative role of a stylistic device, we may not need to go farther to account for its traits. But if we can’t find a denotative role for the device, we will be all the more encouraged to seek others. Since a device may serve several functions, we can always continue to consider expressive, symbolic, and other purposes of the technique.</p>
        <p>Using narrative denotation as a default value offers us both coverage and economy. This hypothesis allows us to acknowledge that a film’s stylistic texture is pervasive, uninterrupted from first moment to last. By contrast, symbolic functions don’t saturate the film’s style to the same degree. It’s unlikely that every bit of lighting, every camera movement, every shift of a figure in the frame, every cut conveys an abstract meaning; indeed, those moments when we spot Christ imagery or a highlighting of gender identity stand out from the background of more ordinary shots and cuts. That constant background has a more primary purpose-what we pretheoretically call “<span>telling the story</span>”. The swiftly cut singles of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire’s</em> airport scene underscore certain lines and facial reactions . Within a wider image, as we’ve seen, a character’s slightest movement can channel the flow of dramatic information: a man’s rising to leave a drinking bout becomes a pivotal action, and even a samovar blocking a face plays a role by obliging us to look for story developments elsewhere. M oment by moment, whatever else it may do, style usually helps tell the story in a particular way.</p>
        <p>Starting from narrative denotation also yields some explanatory economy: we can gather many different techniques under a few general principles. One of the most important, it seems evident, is the principle of directing attention. Typically, a storyteller in any medium seeks to call certain items to our notice and let others recede or drop out altogether. In literature no description of a character or setting constitutes a complete inventory; the writer selects the aspects relevant to the story and the effects to be achieved. Watson doesn’t mention that Holmes has lungs, but they’d become quite relevant if Holmes were to contract cancer from his shag tobacco. In photography or cinema the frame excludes much more than it includes, and within the frame, composition, color, and all the techniques of each medium work to highlight the most important qualities on display.</p>
        <p>Artists are practical psychologists , trusting that our perceptual proclivities, developed through both natural endowment and cultural training, will make some aspects of the story more salient than others. Storytellers further trust that our attention tends to fasten on aspects that attract us in the world outside art. Take the body. Primates’ bodies emit a constant stream of signals about their emotional states and their relations to their conspecifics, and we have evolved to be highly sensitive to the postures, gestures, and movements of those around us. The distance and angle at which two people stand can instantly convey intimacy or dominance, flirtation or confrontation; in all cultures an erect bearing tends to suggest higher status than does a cringe. Gestures punctuate and emphasize speech, and some do duty for words, most through culturally specific signs (such as the cuckold’s horns), a few through universal ones (applauding, shrugging ). Many nonverbal cues, such as the yawn or the clenched fist, may affect us more powerfully than a remark does, since they are hard to suppress and thus more likely to be genuine.<sup>55</sup></p>
        <p>Above all, we are attuned to the face, the most informative part of the body. There is reason to believe that the face evolved partly under pressures to signal socially relevant information, and it now serves as a constantly changing theater of moods. At least six basic facial expressions (happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, anger, disgust or contempt) appear to be recognized across a great many cultures. Other expressions, such as the raised eyebrow for skepticism or hauteur, seem more localized, and cultures also vary in what Paul Ekman calls “<span>display rules</span>” for the circumstances under which expressions are appropriate.<sup>56</sup> Film acting relies heavily on widely recognized facial expressions.<sup>57</sup></p>
        <p>Within the face the most informative zones are the mouth and the eyes, the two areas on which conversing people focus. The eyes are particularly important, since gaze is associated with facial expressions (an aggressive expression and a direct gaze go together in chimps and other primates like us), and we are preternaturally sensitive to the particular angle of the gaze. In a conversation the listener is likely to look more steadily at the speaker than the speaker looks at the listener; the speaker glances away at intervals, using the gaze to punctuate the talk and to check for reactions. The whole process is carefully coordinated so that when the listener speaks, the roles switch. The eyebrows add their own commentary on both the words and the pattern of gazing.<sup>58</sup></p>
        <p>Since in most films human (or humanlike) creatures are the center of interest, we ought to expect that our perceptual system will home in on bodies and faces. Perhaps this is one reason why the classical schemas of shot/reverse shot and eyeline matching communicate so easily across cultures. They build on the rhythm of tum-taking and the pickup of facial and bodily cues in typical human interactions.<sup>59</sup></p>
        <p>Yet classical schemas don’t simply replicate what happens in ordinary interchanges. For the sake of comprehension the schemas simplify the process. They stress faces through medium shots and close-ups, while the shot scale and lighting make eyelines absolutely evident. The actors look steadily at each other far more often than people would in everyday life, so in movies an averted gaze becomes not a normal maneuver but an expression of distraction, guilt, shyness, or some other relevant state. Similarly, filmmakers reduce the normal blink rate. We typically blink twelve to fifteen times per minute, but movie characters blink far less frequently.<sup>60</sup> In our <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em> passage there are fewer than thirty blinks among three characters in a passage of nearly three minutes, and many of these make an expressive point (such as Jerry’s prolonged I-hold-the -floor blinks). If classical continuity streamlines the most salient interpersonal cues, intensified continuity exaggerates and amplifies them. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Simple Men</em>, despite its longer takes and more complex staging, obeys such a strategy. In order to express coldness or wariness, Hartley has his players make eye contact significantly less than a conversing couple would in ordinary life (Figs. i.66-i.68). The result is as artificial in its own terms as the rapt gaze binding Dorothy and Jerry at the luggage conveyor.</p>
        <p>Even styles less tied to close-ups make expressions and eyelines salient by means of composition, lighting, and movement. As we’ll see, Feuillade, Mizoguchi, Angelopoulos, and Hou Hsiao-hsien could not do without the information available in faces. It’s just that in their traditions a range of other nonverbal cues, from posture and gesture to landscape and architecture, provide alternative centers of attention. Faces still matter, but so do the drinking gestures of the foreground figures in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors</em> and the angular tilting to and fro of the uncle at the breakfast table in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Revolutionary</em>. As the chapters proceed, we will see how our directors creatively conceal facial expression, steering us to the denotative, expressive, and decorative possibilities of other aspects of the image.</p>
        <p>A large part of cinematic storytelling crosses cultural borders so easily, and one plausible reason is that it rides on widespread perceptual tendencies. The styles that came to dominate filmmaking seem to have tuned in, through trial and error, to some perceptual and cognitive universals.<sup>61</sup> Long before cinema came on the scene there arose certain commonalities in the way all humans saw, heard, and understood the world’s regularities.<sup>62</sup> Those commonalities were most probably produced by both biological evolution and converging cultural practices.<sup>63</sup> Viewers come to movies dragging their perceptual and cognitive proclivities with them, so, seeking to affect viewers, filmmakers have developed techniques that piggyback on cross-cultural affinities. All film styles are arbitrary in the sense that they could have been otherwise, but certain styles are more effective for certain purposes, such as conveying a story, than rival styles are. If you want your viewer to focus on character reactions, shooting from an angle displaying the faces is more efficacious than shooting, say, from an angle that shows only shoes . Of course, if the filmmaker has other purposes, such as creating a film lyric or an experimental narrative, then uncommon stylistic choices become more appropriate; but even those will work with (or against) the perceptual and cognitive proclivities of potential spectators.</p>
        <p>If, as seems likely, directing attention is one crucial aim of narrative filmmaking, we can usefully invoke another cross-cultural regularity: the fact that all humans use their eyes to search their environment. Because only a narrow region of our eye’s anatomy, the fovea, possesses critical focus, the eyes move to let the fovea attend to items of interest. Sometimes the eyes track slowly moving obj ects via smooth pursuit movements; more often, three or four times per second, our eyes jump from spot to spot in what are called saccades. Saccades sample the environment, bringing features into sharp focus for only about a quarter of a second. If the item is worth studying, microsaccades or flicks shift the fovea slightly over the target.<sup>64</sup> The process of visual search is active, fast, and indebted to our biological heritage. Scanning the environment and monitoring changes in it by fixating on crucial aspects yield robust evolutionary advantages to mammals like us. Unsurprisingly, newborn babies’ gazes linger on faces, particularly eyes and lips.</p>
        <p>Both saccades and pursuit movements are purposive, prompted by information arriving at other parts of the optical system (chiefly peripheral vision) and other perceptual systems, such as hearing. Psychologists speak of a “<span>covert attentional system</span>” guiding our eye movements.<sup>65</sup> Since saccades bring the most informative regions to the fovea, it seems likely that the mind directs saccades by generating hypotheses about what to look for-in effect, a cognitive map. Nonfoveal vision sketches a rough spatial layout that gets filled in through closer inspection of the field.<sup>66</sup></p>
        <p>At an intuitive level artists have long been aware of visual search. During the late seventeenth century, members of the French Academy, who offered the first detailed criticism of works of painting and sculpture, based their theory of pictorial order on guiding the spectator’s scanning over time.<sup>67</sup> Hogarth declared that a sinuous line “<span>leads the eye a wanton kind of chase</span>”.<sup>68</sup> Centuries later Katharine Hepburn, according to the cinematographer for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On Golden Pond</em> (1981), tried to upstage her colleagues by wearing a scarlet cardigan because, as with the red accent in an impressionist painting, “<span>your eye goes straight to it</span>”.<sup>69</sup> The contemporary intensified-continuity style would seem to require leading the eye rather brusquely, in the vein of Kuleshov’s demand for legibility. “<span>When a shot is only going to be on screen for three seconds</span>”, notes cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, “<span> . . . there’s no time to decide what is important, so you have to direct their eye, <em>force</em> it</span>”.<sup>70</sup></p>
        <p>Guiding attention has a well-established biological and psychological basis, and it is central to the denotative aims of staging. By appealing to the principle of directing attention we can economically explain many tactics at work in our sample scenes. Techniques of lighting, composition, and performance reinforce qur natural drift toward bodies, gazes , and facial expressions. And the filmmaker who packs the shot with items competing for our attention will often steer us carefully to the most important regions. Many tactics of staging can therefore be seen as ways of managing the viewer’s arc of visual search-not necessarily “<span>forcing it</span>”, in Zsigmond’s strong sense, but guiding it, or offering <em>a line of least resistance</em> that, given the time pressures set by the viewing situation, will pull most spectators along.<sup>71</sup> Of course, style analysis doesn’t demand that we earn degrees in perceptual psychophysics, but in the chapters that follow, while being alert to the expressive, symbolic, and decorative qualities of visual style, I’ll often take the shaping of attention as a default value. Far more often than we usually allow, stylistic choices assist narrative denotation principally by suggesting where and where not to look-always with the understanding that the spectator’s interest is already subject to the gravitational pull of the bodies we see traced in the light of the screen.</p>
        <p>Given the various functions of film style, how can we fruitfully explain a stylistic trend’s historical causes and consequences? Another hypothesis can guide our investigations. Since my concern in this book is with fictional narratives, we should assume that the stylistic organization we detect is the result of filmmakers’ choices among the alternatives available to them. These choices may have been planned before shooting, may have emerged spontaneously in the course of shooting, or may have obtruded themselves in postproduction. To make an oversimplified distinction, they may be “<span>free choices</span>” exactly fulfilling filmmakers’ intentions, or they may be “<span>forced choices</span>” born from external constraints such as time, budget, or lack of authority. From this perspective <em>in order to explain continuity and change within film styles, we ought first to examine the circumstances that impinge most proximately on filmmaking-the mode of film production, the technology employed, the traditions, and the craft routines favored by individual agents</em>. More “<span>distant</span>” factors, such as broad cultural pressures or political demands, can manifest themselves only through those proximate circumstances, in the activities of those historical agents who create a film. The zeitgeist can’t switch on the camera.</p>
        <p>The argument I’ll be pursuing runs counter to explanatory frameworks that have dominated film historiography. These have been macroscopic accounts, tracing film style (or other aspects of films) to a spirit of an age, an ideology, national culture, or epochal conditions such as “<span>modernity</span>” or “<span>postmodernity</span>”. I’ll try to show in the last chapter that for the most part these frameworks are vague; their proponents have not spelled out the causal mechanisms by which such elusive factors could shape the fine-grained qualities we can find in the films; and those proponents have proven reluctant to test their claims through counterexamples. In sum, our propelling question—What are the aesthetic possibilities and historical ramifications of the staging-based traditions?—isn’t adequately addressed by such broad-based accounts.</p>
        <p>For example, we’re tempted to invoke broad cultural circumstances to explain the cutting pace of intensified continuity. In a media-saturated age, some would say, our sensibilities are attuned to rapid-fire imagery. At the limit perhaps our perceptual threshold has been raised; we may be “<span>visually literate</span>” in a way that previous generations were not, and we can take in pictorial information at a faster clip. Yet although we may have indeed <em>developed a taste for</em> fast-paced imagery, it seems unlikely that we’ve somehow <em>expanded our powers</em> to assimilate it. After all, audiences have seen fast cutting before. In the American cinema of the 1920s shots averaged four to six seconds each, not so far from the norm of the 1980s and early 1990s. Moreover, although most US films of the 1930-1960 period used longish takes, the many that did employ fast cutting weren’t illegible. Audiences are versatile: today’s films favor one of many cutting rhythms that viewers have long been able to assimilate. Through a mutual process of feedback and correction, filmmakers have shifted toward new norms, and those norms most plausibly arise from the historical dynamic I’ve tried to specify, such as the demands that filmmakers believed television to have placed on them.</p>
        <p>Fast cutting would seem easy meat for an epochal explanation; the task gets a lot harder when we ask how a cultural shift in perception could explain the rise of other features of intensified continuity, such as the reliance on stand-and- deliver staging or long lenses or arcing camera movements. In studying intensified continuity we find that one advantage of teasing out quite specific stylistic traits is that we force ourselves to propose fairly precise local causes for them. Similarly, in considering staging I’ll be pointing to some pictorial strategies of extraordinary delicacy, and these resist being subsumed into the broad, quasi-Hegelian frameworks (modernity, postmodernity) on offer today. The next four chapters proceed inductively, working from particular stylistic features toward the most pertinent and proximate functions and causes we can detect. The final chapter argues that the sort of stylistic features brought to light are not crisply explained by national culture or epochal conditions.</p>
        <p>As a first approximation I suggest that the most salient way to assign functions and causes is to treat stylistic strategies as <em>solutions to problems</em>. Indeed, says David Zucker, director of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Airplane!</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ghost</em>, “<span>Directing is mostly about solving problems</span>”.<sup>72</sup> What kinds of problems? In narrative cinema many problems revolve around <em>telling a story in a specific way</em>. How to create, through the actor, the character’s reaction and then make sure the audience sees it at the proper moment ? How to move actors around the frame to indicate their relationships, their emotional states , their responses to the ongoing drama? When do you cut to a reverse shot of B-a bit before A finishes the line, just after A finishes, or after a pause holding on A? These are, at a primary level, problems of narrative denotation, expressivity, and audience uptake.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, however, the filmmaker doesn’t have to solve each problem from scratch. The tradition in which she or he works furnishes a repertory of schemas, those norms of style that experts can recycle, modify, or reject. When Ron Howard advises the novice to shoot masters, then OTS’s, and then singles, he’s pointing to a cluster of schemas that have over the years reliably solved the problem of conveying a conversation with rising emphasis. And schemas, like all constraints, always offer further zones of choice. Even within the analytical continuity tradition Howard mentions, one still has a wide latitude in choosing shot scale, composition, timing of the shots and cuts, and so on. You might shoot the master as a bird’s- eye view, as De Palma sometimes does, or frame the reverseshot singles with the characters looking directly at the camera, as Jonathan Demme does.</p>
        <p>Here is why I started out by concentrating on particular options historically open to filmmakers . Filming a dinner-table conversation is a problem many directors face, and there are canonized ways to solve it, each with advantages and drawbacks. The filmmaker selects from the repertory available, or modifies the norms she knows, and thereby steers the moment-by-moment flow of the scene in a particular direction, with concomitant appeals to spectators. Originality emerges when a filmmaker creatively fits a new means to a recognized end, or decides on new goals that rework an old means.</p>
        <p>The problem-solving perspective entails that every problem has more than one solution, yielding varying rewards . Some solutions are favored by tradition. The artist inherits a body of craft practices, and those practices settle into stylistic standards. In cinema the emergence of Hollywood’s powerfully pervasive international style yielded a solid basis for both conservative and experimental filmmaking. Dali and Bunnuel’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Un chien andalou</em> (1928), a prototype of avant-garde cinema, achieves its force by presenting repulsive or amusing absurdities while apparently following canons of classical continuity. In explaining why a group style changes or maintains stability, or in analyzing how a filmmaker achieves a distinctive style in a single movie or across her career, we arrive at the most concrete results when we reconstruct a historically plausible choice situation. In order to do this, we must study other films both inside and outside the tradition; search for evidence of the filmmakers’ purposes; examine the technology available; and reconstruct relevant institutional constraints. For example, we can understand the emergence of intensified continuity by considering how television shaped both production and exhibition, how new technologies like the Steadicam favored certain kinds of shots (and encouraged filmmakers to expand their ambitions), how demands for more efficient production and more choices in the editing phase encouraged the use of multiple cameras and shorter shots. Such is the milieu in which filmmakers must survive, and they are always alert for ways in which such tangible forces can expand their range of choice, solve standing problems, or pose new ones that can be creatively overcome.</p>
        <p>With this framework in mind we can ask, What are the aesthetic resources of stylistic traditions grounded in cinematic staging? How have those resources been explored by four major filmmakers across history? In seeking answers, we’ll often find that although directors draw strength from their social milieus, they also belong to the international community of filmmakers, a community with a craft tradition of shared problems and solutions, norms and schemas , and bound by the common aim of arousing audiences through the power of moving pictures.</p>
        <p>MISE-EN-SCENE AND CLASSICAL CONTINUI CINEMA</p>
        <p>During the 1920s and 1930s, Hollywood filmmakers blended continuity editing tactics with prolonged shots in which bodies moved gracefully around the frame. Longish takes allowed actors to deliver fairly lengthy lines to others, who could react not only through facial expression but also through gesture and posture. A sophisticated example is the choreography in Howard Hawks’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Girl Friday</em> (1940). The first extended scene is.a quietlyvirtuosic lesson in how to build a conversation around body language: stance, eye line, orientation, and gesture. Consider only one passage out of a virtually seamless whole. Hikly has come to tell Walter she’s getting remarried and quitting the newspaper. Walter has just ordered hisoffice manager to contact the governor and pressure him to pardon the condemned murderer Earl Williams. As Walter launches his efforts to win Hildy back through both seduction and intimidation, Hawks asks his players to use their hands, knees, laps, and angle ofhead to plot the moment-by-moment flow of comedy, while his shrewd compositions create and resolve spatial tensions (Figs. 1.20-1.26). Although the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> critics never analyzed scenes in this sort of detail, they intuitively registered a subtlety of which the audience was unaware, and they celebrated that “<span>transparency</span>” as a central quality of “<span>classical</span>” mise-en-scene.</p>
