        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Mizoguchi, Or Modulation</h2>
        <p>American films swept the globe in the wake of World War I, and the decoupage methods they employed soon became a cinematic lingua franca.<sup>1</sup> Feuillade and his contemporaries adjusted to the new norms, and a younger generation-Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Carl Dreyer, Fritz Lang, F. W. Murnau, and many others-embraced them eagerly. The few Asian films surviving from before 1930 suggest that Japanese filmmakers also developed assured, idiosyncratic variants of the emerging style.</p>
        <p>Fragments from the l910s indicate that, like Western filmmakers, Japanese directors used both lateral staging, with figures strung out perpendicular to the camera, and a more diagonal arrangement (Figs. 3.1-3.2). Soon came demands to modernize Japanese cinema. The “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Pure Film</span>” movement urged directors to adopt close -ups and crosscutting, as well as Hollywood script formats.<sup>2</sup> Magazines published explanations of American continuity practice, and one column habitually compared the number of shots in foreign films to the cutting rate in Japanese films.<sup>3</sup> Some advocates hoped that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Americanized</span>” filmmaking would force directors to abandon outworn theatrical traditions; other writers argued that only by adopting foreign techniques could companies find export markets . New studios, most notably Shochiku, were formed with the avowed purpose of producing modern, world class films.</p>
        <p>Japanese directors were thus pressured to master continuity editing, and by the mid-1920s most had.<sup>4</sup> A climactic sequence of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cuckoo</em> (Ikeda Yoshinobu, 1922), for example, displays notable subtleties of cutting and camera angle (Figs. 3.3-3.4). Apart from the unusual variety of angles, the scene illustrates a characteristically Japanese interest in the decorative dimension of the image. The curving iron bedstead, partly hiding the family’s faces, becomes a vivid graphic component, adding a purely pictorial dimension to the mournful tenor of the scene.</p>
        <p>The modernization of Japanese cinema was accelerated by a 1923 earthquake that demolished large stretches of Tokyo. There came a call to rebuild Japan on a scale commensurate with the glittering metropolitan West. The major cities began to sport office buildings, coffee shops, comic books, jazz, flapper styles, and other marks of urban sophistication.<sup>5</sup> Film companies eliminated remnants of theatrical tradition, such as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">oyama</em> (female impersonator). Production accelerated to an astonishing six hundred to eight hundred films per year, making Japan’s industry the world’s most prolific. Into the studios came a new generation of men who admired foreign films and who were aware of contemporary trends in theater, art, and politics. Kinugasa Teinosuke, Ito Daisuke, Makino Masahiro, Mizoguchi Kenji, Ozu Yasujiro, Naruse Mikio, Gosho Heinosuke, Uchida Tomu, Shimazu Yasujiro, Shimizu Hiroshi, and others forged modem Japanese film. Beginning their careers in the 1920s and early 1930s, they defined their country’s cinema for thirty years.<sup>6</sup></p>
        <p>Directors found varied solutions to the problem of catching up with Hollywood and Europe. Many films surviving from the period straightforwardly obey the premises of analytical continuity. Beyond this baseline three distinct tendencies emerged. Most arresting is what we can call a calligraphic style, showcased in the swordplay films (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">chanbara</em>). Here swordsmen hurl themselves into combat at hyperaccelerated speed, popping in and out of the frame unexpectedly, glimpsed in swift, often bumpy panning and tracking movements. Cutting is very rapid, often flamboyantly disjunctive. A much calmer technique is on display in what we can call “<span>piecemeal</span>” decoupage. Here each scene is broken into many distinct medium shots and close -ups, not only of faces but of hands , props, and details of setting. The Shochiku studio cultivated this American-Lubitsch approach, and it is on display in the silent films of Ozu, Naruse, and Gosho. A third style is predicated on distant shots , meticulous compositions, and graceful camera movements. Mizoguchi may have helped solidify this “<span>pictorialisf</span>” approach, which became a marker of prestige in the late 1930s (Fig. 3.5).<sup>7</sup></p>
        <p>Although all three approaches derived from classical continuity, each fostered experimental impulses too. The calligraphic style encouraged camera tricks and hectic cutting, sometimes with little concern for anything but visceral arousal. The result is a frenzied pictorial style that has few counterparts in Western cinema until the 1960s. The piecemeal approach allowed Ozu to expand Hollywood’s 180-degree dramatic space into a circular arena of action and then cultivate a playful approach to framing, setting, and shot design.<sup>8</sup> The pictorialist tendency, as we will see in Mizoguchi, permitted the filmmaker to cultivate exceptionally delicate staging tactics. Overall, the urge to decorate the stylistic surface, to embellish even a straightforward scene with momentary flourishes, remained a hallmark of Japanese films. At the climax of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wife, Be like a Rose!</em> (1935), for example, N aruse constantly tracks the camera up to and away from his players, cutting these sweeping movements together in overtly parallel patterns.</p>
        <p>Throughout the world the coming of sound modified the continuity framework. Shots became lengthier; whereas the typical US film of the l920s averaged around five seconds per shot, that duration doubled in the sound era. Several factors slowed cutting pace. Shots could not be broken up by intertitles, and it was difficult to synchronize dialogue during editing. Because moving the heavy sound cameras to various setups was time -consuming, directors tended to sustain their shots. However, once mobile supports were devised to shift the camera around the set, directors began to utilize more frequent tracking shots than they had in the silent era, if only to add the visual variety lost through a slower cutting pace. Likewise, depth staging and the deep-focus image were integral to early silent cinema, but filmmakers from Europe, Russia, the United States, and elsewhere found that these techniques could also fulfill the demands of dialogue -based production. Many directors who achieved prominence in the mature sound cinema, from Jean Renoir and Max Ophuls to William Wyler, George Cukor, and John Stahl, made long takes and staging in depth central to their aesthetic repertoire. Still, their innovations operated within the framework of analytical cutting, shot/reverse shot, and judiciously placed close -ups highlighting the main turns in the action.</p>
        <p>Japan’s changeover to sound was slowed by indecision about technology and the resistance of the powerful <em class="notranslate" translate="no">benshi</em>-the commentators who accompanied film screenings by explaining the story and taking on the voices of the characters. Once sound filmmaking arrived, however, stylistic change paralleled the Western path. The calligraphic trend died out. Piecemeal decoupage survived, as did the pictorialist approach, which now often favored stately, distant framings and rather long takes. And the baseline remained a more sober, quasi-Hollywood technique. This last became dominant during the Pacific war period, stylistically the most conservative years of Japanese filmmaking.</p>
        <p>After the war the most ambitious young directors, Kurosawa Akira and Ichikawa Kon, sustained the vigorously flamboyant approach to filmmaking pioneered in the l920s. Older masters like Ozu and Shimizu continued to refine their unique styles. Soon, however, the audience became younger, the genres of juvenile delinquency and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">yakuza</em> ( gambler) movies arrived, and movie attendance went into a tailspin. The arrival of directors like Oshima Nagisa and Imamura Shohei in the late l95os definitively marked the end of the golden age. Still the anarchic, abrasive power of the young men’s films and their rebellion against their fathers’ cinema should not make us forget a simple fact: on the foundation of classical Hollywood decoupage the interwar generation of Japanese directors built perhaps the most subtle and variegated national film style the world has yet known.<sup>9</sup> In this process Mizoguchi Kenji-arguably film history’s greatest exponent of stagingplayed a central role.</p>
        <blockquote>The eye wants to overcome difficulties. One should of course set it tasks capable of solution; but the whole history of art is proof that this morning’s “<span>clarity</span>” is now boring and that visual art can afford to dispense with partial obscurity, momentary visual puzzle ment, as little as music can dispense with dissonances, false endings, etc. Heinrich Wolfflin<sup>10</sup></blockquote>
        <p>Born in 1898, Mizoguchi belonged to what Japanese historians call the “<span>generation of 1900</span>”.<sup>11</sup> As these young people were growing up, their nation proved itself a military power, seized Korea, launched its first experiment with parliamentary democracy, and opened its doors to Western culture, both high and low. Although the Communist Party was weak, Marxism had a wide influence on intellectuals and artists. So too did a stream of translations, foreign films, and imported visual art. In the midst of this ferment Mizoguchi, the son of a Tokyo carpenter, discovered a love of art. As a boy he apprenticed to a design house, and in his teens he attended a school teaching Western-style oil painting. All the while he was reading widely and attending the theater. In Kobe he worked in a publicity firm while writing poetry, flirting with Christian socialism, and founding an amateur theater troupe. In 1921 an actor friend found him a job as a player and assistant at the Nikkatsu studio, and he began as a director in 1922.</p>
        <p>Other aspects of his life might have furnished the plot for one of his own melodramas. At age seven Mizoguchi saw his father go bankrupt and sell his sister as a geisha. When his mother died ten years later, he quarreled with his father and went to live with his sister, who by then had become an aristocrat’s mistress. Soon after Mizoguchi started directing, he began an affair with a geisha who was also involved with a gangster. One night the woman slashed his back with a razor, an incident that won Mizoguchi notoriety and a three -month suspension from Nikkatsu. (He was fond of displaying the scar and remarking, “<span>You cannot portray women unless you have been stabbed like me!</span>”) Shortly afterward, he met a gangster’s wife at a dance hall and persuaded her to leave her husband. Once they were married, the couple quarreled bitterly, and from 1941 Mizoguchi’s wife was confined to a mental hospital because of syphilis.<sup>12</sup></p>
        <p>Despite his sensational private life, he proved himself an efficient and accomplished director. After the 1923 earthquake he moved to Kyoto, and there, amid the old Japan of temples and licensed pleasure quarters, he would reside the rest of his life. His earliest films appear to have explored a variety of modes: lyrical naturalism, aesthetic experiment, military propaganda, and a quasi-Marxist proletarian realism. Mizoguchi made some commercial hits , such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tokyo March</em> (1929), and his work began to place in the annual “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Best Ten</span>” lists compiled by the film journal <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kinema Jumpo</em>. With <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taki no Shiraito</em> (a.k.a. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">White Threads of the Wateifall</em>, 1933), which placed second in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kinema Jumpo</em> poll, he joined the front rank of directors. One mark of his new renown was that whereas most directors worked steadily for a single company, he was able to break with Nikkatsu and migrate among companies from 1933 onward.</p>
        <p>By then he was known as a specialist in feminine melodrama. Because Nikkatsu’s foremost director, Murata Minoru, preferred making films centering on men, the company had forced Mizoguchi to take up women’s genres, but eventually he came to like the idea. Literary and theatrical traditions provide any Japanese artist with a storehouse of situations based on victimized women. Merchants or clerks fall in love with prostitutes or aristocratic ladies, maternal prostitutes sacrifice themselves for men’s careers, girls are sold into bullying marriages.<sup>13</sup> All these pathetic situations, derived from kabuki and puppet theater, furnished plots for popular novels serialized in newspapers and an emerging form of theater called shinpa. Shin pa was a romanticized, quasi-modern version of kabuki that became hugely popular at the turn of the century. Many plays highlighted independent women, often in the sex trade, crushed by social obligations and unfeeling men. When Mizoguchi entered the film industry, any tear-jerking film set in modern times was considered an offshoot of shinpa. He adapted some shinpa plays, and once he went off on his own, he clung to the shinpa aesthetic for the rest of his career.</p>
        <p>Mizoguchi found his greatest degree of independence in working at Dai-Ichi Eiga, a company he founded in 1934 with the ambitious producer Nagata Masaichi. He made several important films for Dai-Ichi Eiga, and two 1936 projects, both written by Yoda Yoshikata, proved to be groundbreaking. “<span>I didn’t begin portraying humanity accurately until <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters of Gion</em></span>”.<sup>14</sup> In the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kinema Jumpo</em> poll <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa</em> won third place, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters</em> won first. When Dai-Ichi Eiga dissolved, Mizoguchi moved with Nagata to the Shinko company and then to Shochiku, which placed great resources at his disposal. His film about a kabuki actor in the Meiji era, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum</em> (1939), won a government award, and he went on to create a cluster of films celebrating traditional Japanese arts. As the nation mobilized for the Pacific war, he was assigned to direct a colossal version of the classic 47 ronin tale <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em> (1941-1942), the most expensive Japanese film yet made. By now he was motion picture consultant to the cabinet and head of the Japanese Filmmaking League. One critic called him “<span>the master among masters in the Japanese film world . . . . To talk about this man is at the same time to talk about the path upon which Japanese film has progressed</span>”.<sup>15</sup></p>
        <p>Starting out in the 1920s had toughened him; directors often confronted lazy crews protected by yakuza gangs, and shooting might be disrupted by brawls. Mizoguchi adopted a ferocious demeanor. The “<span>three-clawed fiend</span>”, as Yoda called him, was capable of demanding that telegraph poles be cut down because they spoiled a composition. He insisted on lengthy rehearsals before filming, but he refused to instruct the actors; when their performances fell short, he screamed at them, with furious spasms shaking his right shoulder. “<span>He drank a lot and had a very foul mouth on the set</span>”, one recalled.<sup>16</sup> Coming in each morning, actors would confront a blackboard bearing entirely new dialogue for the scene. Mizoguchi sometimes worked his staff through days and nights, keeping a chamber pot nearby so that he would never have to leave the set. Yoda’s memoirs are a catalog of caprices and indignities. On the day of Yoda’s marriage Mizoguchi badgered him about a new script.<sup>17</sup> Yet after a drinking bout the fiend could suddenly start pounding his head on the tatami mat, shouting, “<span>This man they call Mizoguchi is an idiot!</span>”<sup>18</sup></p>
        <p>He played out political contradictions too, as did many men of his generation. During the late 1930s their youthful attraction to Western culture and Marxist politics gave way to patriotism and a rededication to “<span>national purity</span>”.<sup>19</sup> Mizoguchi made several military propaganda films and put his name to ghostwritten declarations of faith in Japanese conquest. (“<span>I believe in the film of war</span>”.)<sup>20</sup> After Japan surrendered and US forces occupied the country, he executed another about-face. Conforming to Occupation demands, he criticized feudal traditions and pleaded for women’s rights in a string of films that often showcased the brilliant actress Tanaka Kinuyo. He also mounted lush melodramas, usually set in upper-class surroundings. In 1953 Mizoguchi joined Nagata Masaichi at his revived studio, now called Daiei, and he alternated contemporary dramas with historical pieces. Most of his postwar films were received coldly by both the press and the public, and some critics complained about his old-fashioned style and shinpa romanticism, but he continued to occupy the spotlight. He served as adviser to the ministry of education, president of the production labor union, a member of Daiei’s board of directors , and president of the Film Directors Association from 1949 until his death.</p>
        <p>Many of his postwar projects also exemplify that “<span>return to Japan</span>” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">nihon kaiki</em>) that is said to be characteristic of Japanese artists who cast aside their youthful fascination with the West.<sup>21</sup> Early in Mizoguchi’s career he adapted European and American literary works, and he professed an interest in the films of von Sternberg and Lubitsch and in the painting of Picasso, Matisse, and de Chirico. His wartime films were required to project a spiritualized image of Japanese culture, but he did not swing back to an affirmation of Western values when peace arrived. Instead, he intensified his interest in traditional Chinese and Japanese art. Accordingly, the Occupation-era project <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro and His Five Women</em> (1946) paid tribute to the great eighteenth- century painter. Mizoguchi converted to Buddhism and began rereading the Japanese classics. Along with the faithful Yoda he adapted a play by the great Chikamatsu (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chikamatsu Monogatari</em>; a.k.a. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Crucified Lovers</em>, 1954), drew <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Life of Oharu</em> (1952) from a novel by the satirist Saikaku, and offered his treatment of Japan’s greatest historical epic in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shin Heike Monogatari</em> (a.k.a. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New Tales of the Taira Clan</em>, l956). He adapted several other films from well-respected modern novels.</p>
        <p>Thanks largely to Nagata’s shrewd export strategies, Mizoguchi startled the film world by winning the top prize at Venice three years in a row, for the historical dramas <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Life of Oharu</em> (1952), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ugetsu Monogatari</em> (1953), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sansho the Bailiff</em> (1954). By the time he died of leukemia in 1956, he was second only to Kurosawa as an emblem of Japanese cinema.</p>
        <p>The French, as so often, led the way to his canonization, with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du cinema</em> running reviews and translated pieces, including Yoda’s memoirs. Monographs appeared.<sup>22</sup> In a period in which Ozu, Naruse, and others remained virtually unknown in the West, Mizoguchi constituted the only major alternative to the rugged, flashy Kurosawa. The praise ran to extremes. “<span>Kenji Mizoguchi is to the cinema</span>”, wrote Jean Douchet, “<span>what Bach is to music, Cervantes is to literature, Shakespeare is to the theatre, Titian is to painting: the very greatest</span>”.<sup>23</sup> His languid pace and burnished imagery embodied that mystique of mise-en-scene that was central to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> aesthetic. The ecstasy of Sarris before <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madam Yuki</em>’s shimmering lake vista, unspoiled by subtitles, belongs to this tradition. Mizoguchi aimed, wrote Godard, simply “<span>to leave things to present themselves, with the mind intervening solely to efface its own traces</span>”.<sup>24</sup> Jacques Rivette noted that these films, however distant culturally, “<span>speak to us in a very familiar language. Which one? The only one to which a director must aspire: that of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise en scene</em></span>”.<sup>25</sup> Thanks partly to the eloquence of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> writers, Mizoguchi has remained known chiefly through his richly realized costume pictures.</p>
        <p>To understand his achievement more exactly, however, we must attend to details. And then we discover a practice of staging whose visual ambitions are almost without peer in film history. For Feuillade, the image was primarily a vehicle for storytelling; pictorial invention, however important, flowed from that purpose. For Mizoguchi cinematic staging was above all a pictorial art-one that, he believed, paradoxically came into its own only with sound filming. His task was to integrate bold and intricate visual design with the demands of narration and emotional expression.</p>
        <p>A concrete case affords us a good starting point. Early in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Lift of Oharu</em> (1952), the heroine has been sent home from court after a scandalous affair with a low-ranking samurai. She and her family have been exiled. Before her lover, Katsunosuke, is beheaded, he sends her a message. He asks her to marry a good man for whom she feels true love, adding defiantly that he hopes for a day when no love is forbidden by social rank. On reading Katsunosuke’s letter Oharu grabs a knife and rushes outside to kill herself; her mother pursues her into the woods and disarms her, leaving both women sobbing on the ground.</p>
        <p>The pivotal portion of the scene occurs when Oharu’s mother delivers Katsunosuke’s message. The shot begins normally enough, with the two women seated (Fig. 3.6) in a fairly distant framing. Warning that the father must not learn of this, Oharu’s mother turns from us and rises to keep watch for him. Oharu slides behind a hanging kimono to read the letter (Fig. 3.7). Strikingly, the kimono conceals her face; but we do hear a sob.</p>
        <p>Suddenly Oharu scrabbles toward the lower right of the frame, visible only in a squarish gap left by another kimono. As the mother turns and lunges behind the kimonos, a thrashing movement can be sensed in the gap, broken by an intermittent glint (Fig. 3.8). The central kimono is yanked down a s the women struggle (Fig. 3.9). Oharu rushes out of the frame, and now a knife blade quickly flashes past us (Fig. 3.10). Her mother runs after her. Outside, a high-angle camera movement catches Oharu racing out of the house (Fig. 3.11). The camera follows her as her mother wrests the knife from her (Fig. 3.I2). The two run diagonally into the depth o f a bamboo grove (Fig. p 3 ) before collapsing in extreme long shot, sobbing (Fig. 3.14).</p>
        <p>It is a commonplace of Mizoguchi criticism that he favors deep space and long takes (here the first shot runs about forty seconds, the second about seventy). But it is his staging principles that give the scene its distinct quality. For a start, Oharu’s distraught reaction to the message is not presented via close views of the heroine, music underscoring her tearful face, or an emphasis on the knife she snatches up. Instead the camera stays at a considerable distance and lets key actions remain almost entirely hidden. Mizoguchi has also divided our attention almost perversely. The vigilant mother and the prominent doorway stir some expectation that the father may discover them (Fig. 3.7), but he doesn’t. Instead, the drama develops through Oharu’s reaction, which is concealed from us by the hanging kimono. Her grief is signaled on the sound track, which yields a sob and then the frantic rustle of movement. Her pain becomes resolutely private, as if the narration were reluctant to intrude on the purity of her relation to her lover. The knife itself is scarcely visible, squeezed into a sector of the frame we normally ignore (Fig. 3.8, on extreme lower right). The mother’s cries of distress offer some clues as to Oharu’s overwrought state, but the daughter’s intentions remain uncertain until the knife flashes through the lower right foreground (Fig. po), just long enough for us to see it.</p>
        <p>As Mizoguchi had confined the knife to an aperture, so now he lets us glimpse Oharu fleeing the house through a tunnel of bamboo trees (Fig. 3 . n ). He now reverses his scaling strategy, bringing Oharu to the foreground as she gives up the knife to her mother (Fig. 3 . 12). Then Oharu shrieks, “<span>I’ll go to Katsunosuke!</span>” Announcing that she’ll find another way to join him in death and running off to the distance. The mother pursues her in a zigzag course and grapples with her in extreme long shot before both drop to the ground (Fig. 3.13). The urgency of the first shot tapers into something more lyrical as the women plunge into the grove. Once more Mizoguchi refuses us proximity and facial expression. It is in the writhing and collapsing of Oharu’s body that we grasp her passage from wild abandon to resignation (Fig. 3.14). Her desolation is made all the more poignant by the stillness of the grove (crows call on the sound track) and the sedateness of the camera movement.</p>
        <p>Mizoguchi’s oblique narration—suppressing Oharu’s response, diverting us with the pretext that the father might catch her—creates a pictorial field that he can charge with emotion. Starting as a straightforward presentation of the action, the first shot transmogrifies into an exploration of the design possibilities of the two hanging kimonos. They begin as a realistic backdrop; then one becomes a convenient screen for masking Oharu’s reaction; then the other yields a tantalizing aperture within which she seizes the knife. Before our eyes, several zones of space-the doorway, the two kimonos-bristle with the promise of action and expression. The picture, richly composed without looking stuffed, bursts into violence thanks to the lures and traps built into it. In the bamboo grove the placid landscape absorbs Oharu’s despair, leaving her with only acceptance; but it also continues the game with visibility by letting her and her mother veer from the camera and dodge through the bamboo stems. Mizoguchi has brought the denotative, expressive, and decorative aspects of the image into remarkable harmony.</p>
        <p>We could find scores of such dazzling scenes in this director’s oeuvre, but broader questions nag us. We are very far from the trim, lucid world of Feuillade. What historical circumstances led Mizoguchi to pose such staging problems and solve them so inventively? How did the problems and solutions change, and why?</p>
        <p>Any answers to these questions must be tentative, chiefly because we cannot chart his overall development with much confidence. Mizoguchi started directing in 1923, and by the time he started his first talkie, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hometown</em> (1930), he had made no fewer than fortythree films. All of them are lost save one (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Song of Home</em>, 1925) and one condensation (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tokyo March</em>, 1929). We will probably never see his Arsene Lupin vehicle (813, 1923), his adaptation of Anna Christie (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Foggy Harbor</em>, 1923), his Expressionist film (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood and Soul</em>, 1923), his first critically praised melodrama (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Paper Doll’s Whisper of Spring</em>, 1926), and his version of a best-selling novel about Townsend Harris’s mission to Japan (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Okichi,</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mistress of a Foreigner</em>, 1930). Several works from the next decade have gone missing as well. Even his years of fame are riddled with lost films, at least two of which—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Woman of Osaka</em> (1940) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Life of an Actor</em> (1941)—are likely to have been masterpieces. In all, of the eighty-three feature films he completed, only thirty-one survive more or less intact,<sup>26</sup> and seventeen of these come from the last decade of his career. We rightly regret the loss of such treasures as von Sternberg’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sea Gull</em> (1926) and Murnau’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Four Devils</em> (1928), but faced with deprivation on the Mizoguchian scale, one is tempted to despair. Still, the surviving films are unambiguous on one score: the man liked long takes. He named his method “<span>one scene-one cut</span>”. (Like US filmmakers of the same period, Japanese often called a shot a cut, as in a cut of meat.) From 1935 to the end of his career, the average shot lengths of Mizoguchi’s films range from fifteen seconds to ninety seconds, with most ranging between twenty-five and forty seconds. Although his 1930s contemporaries favored somewhat long takes (an average of ten to twelve seconds for a talkie),<sup>27</sup> his shots are unusually extended for any period or place. Feuillade chose the long take as the default option, simply the received way of shooting scenes. Mizoguchi, starting his career at the moment in which continuity cutting triumphed internationally, clung to the long take against the pull of current practice.</p>
        <p>His stubborn adherence to it added to his production difficulties. In sound filming, with a much heavier camera and all the vagaries of recording dialogue, very protracted shots were more demanding than in the silent era. Moreover, Japanese studios demanded that film stock be conserved, so most directors could shoot few retakes. Mizoguchi’s collaborators recalled that an almost su:fof cating anxiety gripped everyone as the camera was turned on. The slightest mistake would spoil the shot; time and film would be wasted; worst of all, cast and crew would face the demon’s wrath. “<span>He asked the most of everyone, and all at the same second</span>”, recalled his cameraman Miyagawa Kazuo. “<span>If there was a characteristic quality of Mizoguchi, it was this tension and its prolongation</span>”.<sup>28</sup> When producers complained that the long takes delayed the shooting schedule, Mizoguchi replied that the actors weren’t good enough.</p>
        <p>Why cling to the long take in the face of such obstacles ? We might be tempted to treat the device as an end in itself: the longer the take, the more daring (or “<span>radical</span>”) the shot. Yet our Oharu scene prompts us to consider the long take as a by-product of other concerns. The most salient one, it seems to me, is also one of the striking features of Japanese cinema of the late 1920s and the 1930s: an extraordinary passion for densely composed images.</p>
        <p>Consider a moment from Naruse Miki’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Whole Family Works</em> (1939). A factory worker has fathered nine children, and several of his sons want to continue in school. One morning he talks with his eldest son about whether to consult the teacher of Eisaku, his fourth son. By the standards of European and US filmmaking, Fig. 3.15 is an overwrought establishing shot. The architecture splits the image into several pigeonholes, and a foreground figure (Eisaku, with his back to us) serves to further articulate lateral zones of action. Lighting helps by establishing a gradation of emphasis. The two brothers caught in the lattice of the left wall, being somewhat grayer, become less important than the father and eldest son conferring in the better-lit distance on the right. Eisaku, the object of the decision, is given prominence through his silhouette.</p>
        <p>The shot presents story information by establishing several brothers watching the father’s deliberations and by highlighting Eisaku (centered, largest in the frame). But Naruse adds a decorative surplus. Always adept in composition, he sets himself the challenge of arranging seven figures in three areas of the room, achieving both narrative clarity and an elaborate visual pattern.</p>
        <p>Mizoguchi, trained as a painter, was probably quite sensitive to such compositions, and he seems to have realized that his peers didn’t grasp all their implications. “<span>Filmmakers must study the film image and its potential for expression</span>”, he once remarked. “<span>This is our primary responsibility</span>”.<sup>29</sup> He surely noticed that his contemporaries did not sustain their ornate images for very long, being content to enlist them as establishing shots or momentary flourishes. ( Naruse uses nineteen shots in the scene we’ve considered, following the dense master shot in Fig. 3.15 with singles and two-shots linked by eyeline matches.) By the early 1930s Mizoguchi saw that he could sustain the dense image for some time if he could make it unfold in compelling ways. Citing a psychology professor who claimed that film images became boring after five seconds, he began to pursue a “<span>one scene-one cut</span>” method that would absorb the audience for minutes on end.<sup>30</sup> How to accomplish this? On the evidence of his surviving films, his chief strategy was to offer a richly modulated image. His peers had developed schemas of elaborate shot design; he would take such schemas through unpredictable twists and turns. Other directors had made each character’s placement matter visually; he would hold the shot so that a slight shift in position would gather great power. They created nuanced compositions; he would elaborate such nuances for minutes on end. In sum, by means of the long take he could prolong and probe the pictorially arresting norms that emerged in this period.</p>
        <p>Such dense long takes seemed, in Mizoguchi’s judgment, especially appropriate to talking pictures.<sup>31</sup> Whereas fast cutting suited silent film, dramas of his sort, especially in the sound era, favored a long-take style. Editing breaks up “<span>the psychological weight or density that the audience experiences . . . . If you use cross- cuts, there are invariably a few cuts [shots] that shouldn’t be included. And it’s a big mistake to rationalize this by saying they’re short. The hypnotic power has been impaired</span>”.<sup>32</sup> More paradoxically: “<span>Cinema with short cuts is too cinematic</span>”.<sup>33</sup> His reference to the “<span>hypnotic power</span>” of cinema indicates yet another goal that the long take fulfilled. Mizoguchi evidently wanted to hold the spectator in the same sort of rapt apprehension that enfolded his staff on the sound stage. Late in his career he explained: “<span>During the course of filming a scene, if an increasing psychological sympathy begins to develop, I cannot cut into this without regret. I try rather to intensify and prolong the scene as long as possible</span>”.<sup>34</sup> Certainly this rapt attention involves feeling for or with the characters, but the design of the shots suggests that even more is at stake. The image invites the spectator to explore every cranny of the space, to scrutinize even small movements. The long take, Mizoguchi added, “<span>allows me to work all the spectator’s perceptual capacities to the utmost</span>”.<sup>35</sup></p>
        <p>Mizoguchi seeks to entrance the viewer on several registers at once, yet his images offer themselves almost haughtily, indifferent to the viewer’s inclinations . The staging narrates, but it often unfolds the story in an opaque or ambiguous fashion. It offers decorative resonance but with a subtlety that demands that the viewer explore the frame. And the staging becomes expressive but mutedly so. As the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oharu</em> scene suggests, the interplay of visual pattern, narrational display, and expressive qualities can become quite intricate. When Feuillade blocks something and then reveals it, he usually does so unobtrusively, just before we need to see it: an art of clarity. Mizoguchi blocks and only partly reveals, in a teasing visual tremolo; or he creates an opacity that registers as a refusal to specify the story point; or he presents the very intermittence of vision as itself a refined effect worth savoring.</p>
        <p>In his narrational games of vision Mizoguchi often relies on characters’ dialogue and exclamations to express the scene’s feelings, as with Oharu’s unseen sob. In addition, he seeks to make his pictures expressive in themselves. Herein lies one of his great contributions to the history of cinematic staging. By the 1920s the problem of telling a story concisely and suspensefully had been solved, both by the European long-take directors and by their Hollywood peers . Directors faced new tasks, notably that of telling a story with maximal expressiveness, using all available film techniques. Some directors, notably Sjostrom, had found a way to heighten emotion within the tableau tradition; others, such as Gance, Epstein, and the Soviet montage directors, achieved emotional expres sion by pushing editing to extremes.<sup>36</sup> By the mid-1930s filmmakers around the world knew how to quicken the emotional pace through rapid cutting, presenting a train rushing through a landscape, a ride on a merry-go-round, a suspenseful exchange of glances. Hitchcock’s late silent films are typical of the ways in which the montage of close -ups had become a standardized visual rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Synchronized sound, for reasons of technology as much as taste, made cinema less overtly “<span>avant-garde</span>”, as Andre Bazin was among the first to recognize.<sup>37</sup> Classical decoupage, accentuated by camera movements and taken at a slower pace, remained the norm from Los Angeles and Berlin to Moscow and Shanghai. Cutting and camera angle usually served to present the action neutrally; the expressive dimension of the story would be rendered through the script, the music, and the mise-en-scene-above all, the actors’ performances. Through his pictorialism, Mizoguchi sought to make staging more subtly expressive than most directors of the 1930s did. The plot traditions that he inherited emphasized the slow accumulation of emotion, and in order to mesmerize the spectator, his scenes of suffering grew into long takes that mapped the fluctuations of feeling onto the movement and positions of bodies in a thickly furnished space. The obliqueness of his visual narration could foster emotional suggestion.</p>
        <p>His genre proved helpful too. Because melodrama tends to endow the spectator with an omniscient range of knowledge, we are able to anticipate a character’s reaction to news we already know. Mizoguchi can play on this foreknowledge in two ways. Sometimes, his roundabout presentation of a situation can be taken both as tact and as a creative treatment of a stock situation. We have already witnessed the final moments of Oharu’s lover, so we expect her to feel grief when she gets his message. Our expectation is confirmed even though we don’t exactly see it (the mother distracts us, the kimono hides Oharu), but this in turn makes the image register exactly as a sensitive handling of the moment. Alternatively, Mizoguchi can transmit the story situation with little impedance, as we will see in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Five Women</em>. Such occasions allow him to enrich the conventional moment through microactions and barely noticeable differences. A lover’s farewell or a woman’s confession, presented straightforwardly, can play on minute changes of position, glance, shadow. We can take the basic action for granted and scrutinize pictorial nuances that other directors never summon up. “<span>An art of modulation</span>”, Jacques Rivette calls it, and Philippe Demonsablon adds a gloss: “<span>He emits a note so pure that the slightest variation becomes expressive</span>”.<sup>38</sup></p>
        <p>The long take, then, is not an end in itself but a means of riveting the spectator to the exquisite image. The result, in Mizoguchi’s hands, yields something Westerners have long considered “<span>purely Japanese</span>”. When we point out kindred examples, such as the shot from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Whole Family Works</em>, some may want to say that this, too, manifests a typically Japanese use of space. In what follows I ‘ll be avoiding this inference-or, rather, reformulating it. I’m skeptical of a view that would treat such images as late manifestations of a panhistorical Japanese taste or worldview. First, there is no single Japanese aesthetic tradition to be transmitted. Western accounts of Japanese aesthetic concepts are notably onesided, favoring Zen-inflected art, but this is part of the “<span>Japan</span>” packaged for foreign consumption over the last century. Some Japanese traditions indeed emphasize delicacy, spirituality, and understatement, but there are also traditions of roughness, bawdiness, and extravagant emotion.<sup>39</sup> (Contrary to cliches about Japanese aesthetic restraint, film and theater audiences love <em class="notranslate" translate="no">netsuen</em>, scenery-chewing overacting.) Furthermore, we have good evidence that the arrival of Western art and media in the nineteenth century made Japanese artists acutely aware of their own methods,. Now they had a new set of choices . Artists might embrace Western forms (as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">shingeki</em>, the Europeanized modern theater) or blend inherited forms with imported ones (as in shinpa theater or the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">I-novel</span>” ). Even sticking with a received tradition could trigger a search for novelty; by 1900 painters worked in either the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Western-style</span>” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">yoga</em>) or the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Japanese -style</span>” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">nihonga</em>), but the latter could never be confused with the works of centuries past.<sup>40</sup></p>
        <p>There are other reasons to be cautious about explaining Japanese artistic practices as direct continuations of time-honored customs. The artistic concepts purportedly shaping all Japanese art (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">wabi, yugen, iki, mono no aware</em>) often turn out to have complex and ambivalent histories, during which they were redefined for various purposes.<sup>41</sup> More generally, a great many “<span>distinctively Japanese</span>” traditions, from emperor worship to the rules of sumo, were devised in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by elite factions forging new national identities for a modernizing society.<sup>42</sup> We are not in the habit of explaining contemporary Hollywood style by reference to northern European Renaissance painting, so why should ancient aesthetic traditions be relevant to twentieth-century Japanese film? Someone may respond that whereas we have lost touch with premodern customs and ways of thinking, the Japanese have retained a living relation to theirs. Yet this idea itself is no less an invented tradition, with sources in twentieth-century Japanese ethnology and cultural theory.<sup>43</sup></p>
        <p>It seems likely that the notion of a “<span>purely Japanese</span>” cinematic style is another invented tradition. During the l9ros the trade press called for filmmakers not only to match foreign technique but also to express “<span>true Japanese</span>” qualities. Writer Tanizaki Jun’ichiro observed that by making Hollywood-like films he hoped to introduce his nation’s “<span>art and national sentiment</span>” to audiences a broad.<sup>44</sup> This nationalistic view emerged in other countries at the period, as US films offered both models to copy and rivals to surpass.<sup>45</sup> As a result, from the 1920s on Japanese filmmakers often borrowed from, and even cited, pictorial devices found in older arts-all the while inserting these elements into the Western continuity framework. The schemas devised and reworked by filmmakers, harking back to older ones in the graphic arts, are best seen as tactical choices, self- conscious displays of pictorial intelligence. In studying Japanese cinema, it seems most fruitful to treat the flamboyant visual devices we notice as strategic means for achieving specific endsone of which may indeed be the evocation of “<span>Japaneseness</span>” as a distinct national/cultural essence. Mizoguchi, with his mastery of Western staging and editing, his eye for schemas circulating in his milieu, his acute awareness of rivals abroad, and his cultivated taste in Asian art, exemplifies this process with remarkable clarity.</p>
        <p>Although most of his output is missing, the films that we have offer abundant evidence of Mizoguchi’s contributions to the art of cinematic staging.<sup>46</sup> All manner of visual ideas poured from him from the 1930s to the 1950s. Almost every one of his works warrants in-depth analysis, and I regret not being able to explore several of my favorites. To keep things manageable, this chapter tracks his work across four periods. Roughly, we can locate a phase of eclecticism before 1936, an effort toward purity and austerity in his major films of 1936 to 1945, a controlled pluralism between 1945 and 1949, and a phase of refinement running from 1950 to 1956. Someone asking other questions could carve up Mizoguchi’s career differently, but these periods enable me to highlight some important continuities and changes in his staging. To focus things further, I select two or three films from each period as signposts of distinctive and developing strategies. Some films are better known than others, but each illustrates one problem or point in his career profile. This chapter will have served its purpose if its roaming-spotlight survey illuminates the art of a director who set his viewers, and himself, unique challenges.</p>
        <p>A young geisha i s courted by two office workers and an older patron; she i s inclining toward one of the young men when she learns that he is her half.brother (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tokyo March</em>, 1929). An opera singer is sustained by the love of a devoted young woman, but when he becomes a success, he is drawn to a conniving flapper (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hometown</em>, 1930). A female carnival performer supports a young man through his legal studies, while she slips into criminality; when she must stand trial for murder, her case will be prosecuted by her protege (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taki no Shiraito</em>, 1933). As rebels terrorize the countryside, a general holds a coachful of travelers hostage, and several women among them are offered to placate him (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oyuki the Virgin</em>, 1935). A woman working with a gang of art swindlers escapes with an orphaned servant boy, and she prostitutes herself to send him to medical school. Years later, waiting for a night train, he discovers her on the platform, a haggard madwoman (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Downfall of Osen</em>, 1935).</p>
        <p>With plots centered on lowly heroines who sacrifice and suffer for a man, Mizoguchi’s pre-1936 films place themselves on the melodramatic terrain of popular literature and theater. The situations evoke shinpa, and it’s no surprise that the two most famous films of the group, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taki no Shiraito</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Downfall of Osen</em>, derive from shinpa plays based on novels by Izumi Kyoka. Taki is particularly important; frequently adapted for the screen before and after Mizoguchi’s version, it was the prototypical shin pa play.<sup>47</sup> Not every Mizoguchi film that we have from this period relies so heavily on these conventions, but all are melodramatic to a high degree.<sup>48</sup> Even <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Poppy</em> (1935), adapted from a prestigious novel, includes scenes that permit shinpa-like emotional reversals.</p>
        <p>Stylistically, these films are quite varied. Between the mid-192os and mid-193os Japanese cinema was diversifying its expressive means, and fresh influences and technologies crowded in from abroad. Mizoguchi was exploring a range of techniques and story materials, so we shouldn’t be surprised that his films include flamboyant passages of rapid cutting, which look European or even Soviet in inspiration but which were by the late 1920s common in Japanese film as well. A tennis game in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tokyo March</em> is rendered in swift alternating cuts, and a scene showing <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taki no Shiraito</em> flinging herself off a train presents thirty-three shots in forty seconds. As late as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Poppy</em>, when a man is accompanying a woman shopping and meets the other woman he’s romancing, Mizoguchi renders the confrontation in static facial close-ups, trimmed to as little as eleven frames each.</p>
        <p>Mizoguchi would soon leave such assertive montage to others, but he continued to rely on the analytical cuts and shot/reverse-shot matching he had mastered while young. His earliest surviving film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Song of Home</em> (1925), consists of well-executed passages of continuity editing on the American model (Figs. 3.16-3.18). Even when he works with much longer takes, the catchphrase “<span>one scene-one shot</span>” will prove misleading. Mizoguchi almost never handles a scene in a single shot, so editing must orchestrate the flow of his extended takes.<sup>49</sup></p>
        <p>Like Ikeda in our scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cuckoo</em>, early Mizoguchi inclines toward constantly changing camera setups. The process is visible in the scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Song of Home</em>: few of the shots of N aotaro or his family repeat a camera position. This prodigality is typical of the whole film; the climax, in which Naotaro is rewarded with a chance to go to the city and study, consists essentially of alternating shots of him and other characters, but the twelve images present seven different setups. Similarly, the rapidly cut courtroom scene of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taki no Shiraito</em> (1933) yields eighty-five images and forty-five setups. Mizoguchi’s exaggerated depth compositions underscore the differences between camera positions (Figs. 3.19-3.20). By stringing together such striking pictures, he offers not only a readout of the drama but also a virtuosic suite of variations . In the early 1930s he seems so eager to vary shot scale and angle that he is willing to violate precepts of eyeline matching (most obviously in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Poppy</em>).</p>
        <p>From 1930 on, shot length increases. Often, as in the late Feuillade films, a long take is broken by several intertitles. Of the 450 or so shots in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Downfall of Osen</em> (not counting intertitles as shots), about 370 stem from only one hundred setups, so if we clipped out the dialogue titles, several shots would run between one and two minutes.<sup>50</sup> The talkie <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hometown</em> averages 9.9 seconds per shot, partly because of its headlong and bumpy tracking shots and a bravura crane shot zigzagging down a banquet table. Most of Mizoguchi’s silent films contain at least one unbroken take, as when in Osen several complex pans-and-tracks let the action flow around the camera.</p>
        <p>On the whole, though, most Mizoguchi films before 1936 contain little camera movement, for now staging in depth is becoming more prominent. Already, in the shots from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Song of Home</em> above, we see an effort to keep background planes active in the ongoing drama (for example, Fig. 3.18). Mizoguchi seems to have used wide -angle lenses fairly early, occasionally yielding the sort of “<span>big-foreground</span>” schemas that we find elsewhere during the period (Figs. 3.21-3.22). Although he seldom combines staging in depth with long takes at this phase, when he does, he can create dramatic pictorial effects of suspense and surprise, as a scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oyuki the Virgin</em> (1935) nicely illustrates.</p>
        <p>Coach passengers are taken hostage by an intransigent general, and the barmaid Okin offers herself to him in hopes he will free the group. Mizoguchi stages her efforts to seduce him in a series of wide shots displaying constantly changing depth relations . Once Okin is shown into General Asakura’s quarters, a ninety-second shot, taken from the high angle that Mizoguchi will come to favor, allows Okin’s sensuality full play. She brazenly circles his desk, drinks from his glass, and eventually settles in a chair, pouring another drink as he tries to ignore her (Fig. 3.23). This is the beginning of an erotic exchange that Mizoguchi’s staging will amplify.</p>
        <p>A reverse-angle cut presents a new area of space, a room beyond the study (Fig. 3. 24), and Okin drifts into it, passing offscreen (Fig. }25) · Cut to a brief shot of her perched temptingly on the bed (Fig. 3.26), which serves as a pivot to a new depth image, a marked foreground composition putting Asakura close to the camera (Fig. 3.27). In the distance Okin stretches out on the bed and lights a pipe. A 180-degree cut reverses the depth arrangement, putting her in the foreground as he comes to the threshold (Fig. 3.28). Will he succumb to her? No; he closes the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">shoji</em> (Fig. 3.29). She plops a cavalryman’s cap over her face and lies still for several seconds. The suspense would seem to be over. But then murmurs are heard, and she rises. When Okin slides open the door, over her shoulder we can see another passenger, the daughter of a rice merchant, standing sobbing before the general (Fig. 3.30). In the course of this fifty-three second shot the depth relations have squeezed from an ample foreground and full background to a distant dramatic zone wedged between the shoji and Okin’s shoulder. Overall, the narration has restricted our knowledge to Okin’s tour of the quarters , and the revelation of the new victim is made all the more pointed for obliging us to discern her in a thin slice of space.</p>
        <p>This sequence from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oyuki the Virgin</em> also exemplifies Mizoguchi’s creative recasting of some schemas circulating in his milieu. The slot that allows us to glimpse the weeping girl aptly illustrates Japanese directors’ proclivity for aperture framing. Tantalizing partial views were a convention of graphic art, encouraged by features of indigenous architecture, such as gridded rice-paper walls and various sizes of screens (Fig. 3.31). Mizoguchi’s contemporaries exploited this tradition (Fig. 3.32), and it’s likely that the popularity of Josef von Sternberg among Japanese filmmakers lay partly in the way his shots sacrifice narrative disclosure to such pictorial ornamentation (Fig. 3.33). Mizoguchi admired Sternberg’s films and met with him during Sternberg’s 1936 visit to Kyoto.<sup>51</sup></p>
        <p>Mizoguchi would employ aperture framing throughout his career. In this early period he already goes somewhat beyond the one- off flourishes of his contemporaries, perhaps because the aperture tactic lent itself to that perceptual absorption he sought. The device allowed the director to activate any crevice of the frame and rewarded the spectator’s scanning of a dense field, while also providing expressive echoes of the main action (Fig. 3.34). In Hometown aperture framing in taxicab windows becomes a motif (Figs. 3.35-3.36). For the Oyuki scene in the general’s quarters, he at once makes the aperture daringly slender and reserves it for a climactic point in the action. Here the game of vision both mutes the melodramatic revelation and gives it subtle pictorial salience.</p>
        <p>Another move in the game of vision proposed by both von Sternberg and Japanese filmmakers is a play with intermittent visibility-letting characters pass through shadowmottled areas; or momentarily blocking the action with foreground lamps, doorways, or other items; or just letting people turn from us briefly to arouse a desire to see them again (Figs. 3.37-3.38). Mizoguchi turned this schema into something quite idiosyncratic, pushing depth staging beyond denotative functions and toward obliquely expressive ends.</p>
        <p>Often a scene’s crucial narrative action will have concluded, but Mizoguchi continues to play out remarkably indirect staging patterns. His shin pa-flavored scenes exude shame and sorrow, which drive characters to hide their faces and slump in a heap. An early example occurs at the climax of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tokyo March</em>, which forces three characters to collapse or turn from us, all within a setting that further conceals one of them (Fig. 3.39). This array of poses is held fairly briefly, but Mizoguchi soon began to prolong and even flaunt various ways of impeding our vision for expressive ends. One climactic scene of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taki no Shiraito</em> makes blocked vision a source of pictorial suspense. Shirai to confronts the young man whom she has financed through law school; now he is her prosecutor. At first she faces him (Fig. 3.40); but eventually shame overcomes her, and she kneels, turning away from him (Fig. 3.41). Then, astonishingly, Mizoguchi has Shiraito bend down behind the table until only the very top of her head is visible (Fig. 3.42). The table edge acts as a benchmark measuring her act of shrinking, making her shame palpable.</p>
        <p>A less flagrant but more sustained version of this approach dominates a tearful scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Poppy</em> (1935). Back in the village the young tutor Ono had pledged his love to Sayoko, but now in Tokyo he has fallen under the spell of Fujio, and his friend Asai has come to tell the bad news to Sayoko and her father. The entire scene is played out with characters reacting in anguish by doubling over. The scene’s final shot carries the principle to a climax by setting the camera at a distance and letting the father’s movements in depth create ever more minute ways of concealing his and his daughter’s misery (Figs. 3.43-3.46). B y hiding the faces-the most emotionally informative part o f the body-the staging forces us to find heartsickness written in nuances of posture and gesture.</p>
        <p>In most films by other directors expressive qualities of style heighten denotation, the depiction of salient story information through speech and facial expression. But Mizoguchi found ways to play down these cues in favor of other indices of emotion and a more teasing treatment of them. Perhaps he was drawn to stories of “<span>fallen</span>” women partly because the ready-made sentiment brought along a behavioral repertoire. The genre demanded that betrayal, humiliation, and loss yield romantic suffering, which could in turn be displayed in postures. When devastated, people who live on the floor will crumple and curl up like snails. In a culture of shame, people betrayed or humiliated will turn from the camera. They will retreat behind sliding doors and sink behind tables and chairs. More and more Mizoguchi built his mise- en-scene up to moments in which characters come together in misery but struggle to conceal their facial expressions, only to have their bodies suggest their feelings. A staging that both stifles and prolongs signs of acute sadness is only one tendency in the earliest surviving films, but it becomes a dominant strategy in those of 1936 onward.</p>
        <p>Mizoguchi’s breakthrough films of 1936 were promoted and received as works of harsh realism. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> (known in English as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Osaka Elegy</em>), advertised as a “<span>meticulous analysis of the atmosphere of Naniwa</span>”, highlighted local color. It showcased the distinctive Osaka dialect (identified with the crassness of local merchant culture), and it included a scene at the city’s famous puppet theater. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters of Gion</em> is set in “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">low Gion</span>”, the more inelegant pleasure quarters of Kyoto. “<span>I brought to these films the things I had observed in the streets and showed them as they were-the vulgar as the vulgar</span>”.<sup>52</sup> If Mizoguchi and Yoda intended to shock, they succeeded. They had to negotiate with the police over <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em>, and when it was finished, the distributor gave it little publicity; in 1940 it was banned. As for Sisters of Gian, which included prostitutes in its cast, Kyotds high-level geisha protested the film in the newspapers, and government censors declared it “<span>decadent</span>”.<sup>53</sup> Although received well by the critics, the two films probably hastened the collapse of DaiIchi Eiga.</p>
        <p>Their bluntness was not wholly unknown in the current milieu. The “<span>neoromanticism</span>” of shinpa-flavored literature had lost ground to novels of “<span>neonaturalism</span>”, influenced by Germany’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Neue Sachlichkeit</em> movement. “<span>Demi-monde fiction</span>” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">karyu shosetsu</em>) and “<span> love-talk literature</span>” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">jowa bungaku</em>) centered on waitresses, prostitutes, and geisha struggling for survival in a grim urban milieu. Unlike the innocent and passive heroines of shinpa, these cynical women fight back. Cinema had also featured such protagonists, particularly in “<span>tendency films</span>” like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">What Made Her Do It?</em> (1930), the tale of an oppressed woman who rebels by setting fire to a chapel. American imports like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bondage</em> (1933) were flaunting unrepentant gold diggers. Films, popular literature, and high literature were all explicitly criticizing woman’s place in society. “<span>Under the kind of social conditions that exist at present</span>”, writes the protagonist of the novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Waitress</em> (1931), “<span>such a thing as a woman’s helplessness can be understood only by women. Only while she is the object of a man’s pleasure does the latter try to please her with a curious grinning look</span>”.<sup>54</sup> The authorities began to object to this bitter view of modern Japan. In 1939 an official history of current literature classified the neonaturalist trend as a branch of yuto bungaku-pornographic writing.<sup>55</sup> Mizoguchi and Yoda’s hard-boiled heroines sauntered into cinema just as right-wing politicians were deploring the decline of traditional values.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> centers o n Ayako, a telephone operator at a pharmaceutical company. While the company owner Asai tries to seduce her, his wife has her eye on Ayakds boyfriend, Nishimura. Ayako needs money to pay her shiftless father’s debts, so she succumbs to Asai, who installs her in a modern apartment. Asai’s wife finds out, and he leaves Ayako. Now working as a geisha, Ayako beguiles money out of Asai’s executive, Fujino, to help pay her brother’s college tuition. She invites Nishimura to her apartment to confess her transgressions, hoping that he will marry her anyway, but Fujino storms in to demand his money. Ayako is arrested. Nishimura abandons her, and the police release her to her father’s custody. Although she has been supporting the family, they disown her, and she indignantly stalks out to an uncertain life on the street.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters of Gion</em> presents a double plot: a gold-digging <em class="notranslate" translate="no">moga</em> brazenly uses men, while her geisha sister clings loyally to her bankrupt patron. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> combines both sisters’ impulses in its protagonist. Like a shin pa heroine Ayako has proven herself a loyal daughter, and she longs for a respectable married life. But like her sisters in neonaturalist literature, once she is cast out, she spares no tears for her kin, her lovers, or herself. In the last shot ( Fig. 3.47) she strides toward the camera, almost smiling, determined to survive.</p>
        <p>Stylistically, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> is a mixture. Like the early 1930s works, it employs a good deal of cutting, but by now Mizoguchi has given up the orthodox over-the-shoulder shot/reverse shot, and the results are sometimes choppy and disorienting. It is as if, having overlearned the norms of continuity, Mizoguchi felt confident enough to assemble a conversation out of awkwardly matched and oddly decentered images. Often, though, these images include dense compositions with bold foregrounds. (See box.) Ayakds final meal with her family consists of nineteen shots, each from a different setup, thrusting a new face under our nose (Figs . 3.48-3.49). The film also contains neatly rhyming crane shots, paralleling Nishimura’s visit to Ayakds apartment with Asai’s. Mizoguchi’s eclectic style has led at least one critic to judge it artistically regressive.<sup>56</sup> Yet <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> pushes further the experiments with distanced framing, opacity, and muted emotion that emerge sporadically in the earlier films, letting these techniques shape both denotation and expression more fully.</p>
        <p>Japanese directors’ game with visibility included not only aperture framing and intermittent revelation. More common than big foregrounds was an inclination toward curiously empty ones. In many Japanese shots significant planes of depth begin in the middle ground and stretch into the far distance, as already seen in our shots from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Abe Clan</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Whole Family Works</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Iwami Jutaro</em> (Figs. 3.5, 3.15). (Such shots have the advantage of putting more planes in focus; it is easier to keep focus from, say, twelve feet to infinity than from four feet to twelve feet)<sup>57</sup> Mizoguchi employed this distant-depth schema in his earliest surviving films (Figs. 3.30, 3.39, 3.45), and it is exploited in the first shot of our <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oharu</em> sequence (Figs. 3.6-3.10). Such shots force the spectator not only to scan the screen but to scrutinize rather small patches of it. Again, most directors used the empty foreground to create a picturesque establishing shot that initiates an edited sequence. The composition could also serve as a prolonged epilogue for a scene, as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Poppy</em> (Fig. 3.46). Mizoguchi, however, saw still other possibilities.</p>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> an entire scene may be played out quite far from the camera, as when Asai’s wife discovers him in Ayakds apartment (Fig. 3.56). More daring is a later scene in the same setting. Ayako has just told her boyfriend, Nishimura, that she has been Asai’s mistress, and his reaction has been concealed in ways I’ll examine shortly. As Fujino arrives to wrest his money from Ayako, she disguises Nishimura as her “<span>tough protector</span>” and sets him down facing away from Fujino. She quarrels with Fujino in a dining room in the distance (Fig. 3.57), and the camera holds on the composition while he leaves offscreen. Nishimura eventually rises and goes to the rear to talk with Ayako (Fig. 3.58). Here Mizoguchi holds the end of the shot long enough to make sure we see him-just barely see him- slump slightly in his seat. He is already defeated, and a cut to another long shot confirms that this tired, frightened silhouette will never agree to marry a tarnished woman (Fig. 3.59). As in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Poppy</em>, the long take joins forces with what we might call “<span>distant depths</span>” to make characters’ postures salient; but now the take serves not as coda but as revelatory climax.</p>
        <p>Staging the action at such a distance creates a psychological opacity that is deepened by the lighting. In the early 1930s films Mizoguchi had worked occasionally with patches of darkness (Fig. 3.27), and his Dai-Ichi Eiga cinematographer, Miki Minoru, was adept at providing silhouettes and chiaroscuro. Given the atmosphere of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em>’s story, shrouding many scenes in darkness evokes the sordid life Ayako pursues and also leaves certain things to the imagination; but as in Figs. 3.57 and 3.59 it obliges us to notice Nishimura’s posture.</p>
        <p>Now that the entire scene can be narrated through selectively lit long shots, Mizoguchi can add expressive overtones at every moment. When Asai propositions Ayako early in the film, the shot begins at his desk and shows her dodging right and left until he pursues her to the rear of the room. Her evasive embarrassment is, as so often in Mizoguchi, conveyed through a movement away from the camera. This “<span>dorsality</span>” tactic forms the basis of a climactic scene later, when Ayako confesses to Nishimura that she is Asai’s mistress. The shot has an empty foreground, and Ayako leaves him at the table as she turns from us, walking slowly to the rear (Fig. 3.60). Eventually she goes into her dressing room, and Nishimura follows (Fig. 3.61). Then Mizoguchi starts the process all over again, as she shrinks from him (Fig. 3.62), goes to the middle ground (Fig. 3.63), then goes to crouch in the rear, at the farthest point from him possible (Fig. 3.64). He offers no consolation, standing-also with his back to us-mute and impotent. The whole passage yields a powerful sense of Ayako’s shame, expressed less through facial expression than through her plaintive monologue and the arrangement of bodies in space.</p>
        <p>The tone of the scene shifts to desperation. In the corner she twists to her feet and rushes to Nishimura, her face frontal and hotly lit as she begs him to marry her (Fig. 3.65). Now it is Nishimura’s facial reaction that becomes important. Many directors would handle the scene by letting Ayako draw him toward the foreground and swivel his face to the camera so that we look over her shoulder at his face. Not Mizoguchi. Ayako pulls her reluctant suitor away from us and downward, kneeling with him in the middle ground and continuing to plead (Fig. 3.66). A cutaway to Fujino’s arrival outside keeps Nishimura’s reaction unknown-although his silence and passivity suggest that he is shocked and afraid, and further hints to this effect will soon arise from the compositions we’ve already considered (Figs. 3.57-3.59).</p>
        <p>I n their sustained rigor the scenes in Ayako’s apartment g o beyond Japanese norms and Sternberg’s pictorialism. They achieve both denotative richness-a suspense and uncertainty about Ayako’s confession, about Nishimura’s reaction, about Fujino’s retaliationand pervasive emotional tints, conveying, in a film noir atmosphere, the heroine’s alternating shame and braggadocio, oblivious to her lover’s .paralysis. They also require an actress (the jaunty Yamada Isuzu) willing to forgo the glamorous close-ups most would expect. Brilliant though these scenes in Ayakds apartment are, the staging is notably simple. It is as if Mizoguchi, hitting on a way to sustain and develop the “<span>distant- depth</span>” schema, wanted to limit his variables for greater control. Having set himself a unique problem, he would soon make things harder on himself and his collaborators.</p>
        <p>With Japan’s invasion of China in 1937, films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters of Gion</em> became politically unwelcome. The failure of Dai-Ichi Eiga drove Mizoguchi to the Shinko studio, where he accepted assigned proj ects, sometimes shinpa-flavored, sometimes patriotic. He filmed a story about traveling actors based on Tolstoy’s Resurrection (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Straits of Love and Hate</em>, 1937), a home-front film about a soldier’s family (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Song of the Camp</em>, 1938; lost), and a village romantic drama (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ah, My Home Town</em>, 1938; lost). Mizoguchi then moved to Shochiku, where he was given higher-profile proj ects. He made a series of Meiji-mono (dramas set in the Meiji era, 1868-1912), which commemorated practitioners of traditional arts-kabuki performers in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum</em> (1939) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Life of an Actor</em> (1941; lost), puppeteers in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Woman of Osaka</em> (1940; lost). Mizoguchi has said that he ran to the Meiji-mono as sanctuary from propaganda duties, but the government smiled on these celebrations of indigenous culture and Shochiku recruited him for the two-part <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em> (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Chushingura Tale of the Genroku Era</em>, a.k.a. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Loyal 47 Ronin</em>, 1941-1942 ). Based on the nation’s most distinguished heroic legend, featuring the formerly Communist kabuki troupe Zenshinza, adapted from a cycle of plays by the distinguished Mayama Seika,<sup>60</sup> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em> was the most prestigious “<span>national-policy</span>” film. Although it did not garner acclaim, Mizoguchi was sent to scout China for projects. Soon, however, studio resources and film stock began to dwindle, and on tiny budgets Mizoguchi completed another kabuki biography (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Three Generations of Danjuro</em>, 1944; lost), two films honoring famous swordfighters (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miyamoto Musashi</em>, 1 944; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Famous Sword Bijomaru</em>, 1945), and an episode in an all-star patriotic vehicle, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Victory Song</em> (1945).</p>
        <p>I n the surviving films up through 1942 we can see a steady effort to both complicate and purify the most demanding aspects of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em>. Now Mizoguchi builds nearly every scene on long takes. The average shot length increases dramatically, from twenty three seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters of Gion</em> to ninety seconds in the first part of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em> (and eighty-three seconds in the second part). Sisters of Gion pushes farther into chiaroscuro, and although it does not dispense with analytical editing, a great many scenes are played out in fixed, distantly framed shots (Fig. 3.67). With <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Straits of Love and Hate</em>, shot/reverse-shot cutting and big foregrounds are abandoned in favor of sustained long shots that develop in crowded depth (Fig. 3.68). Mizoguchi carries many figures through apertures and patches of darkness, and the results are virtuosic (Fig. 3.69). To this pictorial richness, enhanced by the multilevel backstage areas of kabuki playhouses, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum</em> adds a gravity of figure and camera movement. The rhythm becomes even more majestie in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em>, in which the canonical tale of bloody retribution becomes a tribute to patience and self-sacrifice. The forty-seven vassals’ revenge on the corrupt Lord Kira is perpetually delayed and then (against every convention of previous versions) kept offscreen. Instead, we are given monumental tableaus, statuesque scenes of deliberation, ceremonies conducted with a serene poise, vignettes of characters enduring and fulfilling the samurai code (Fig. 3.70). Mizoguchi’s experiments with pictorial opacity and obliqueness give way to a Homeric transparency, in which every locale, gesture, and stance is articulated crisply-save the heroes’ ritual seppuku, tactfully hidden in a field of taut screens (Fig. 3.71). At once gorgeous and severe, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em> bathes <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bushido</em> in an aura of spirituality.<sup>61</sup></p>
        <p>Three moments in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum</em> indicate how Mizoguchi sets himself the task of purifying and nuancing his staging during the war period. The plot, set in the late nineteenth century, centers on the young actor Onoe Kikugoro, whose weak performances disgrace his adopted kabuki family. None of Kiku’s hangers-on dares to criticize him, but the family maid, Otoku, is frank and offers to help him improve. Their friendship scandalizes the family, who cast both out. With Otoku Kiku embarks on a lengthy tour of the provinces to gain more practice. He often despairs or turns lazy, but Otoku (another version of the devoted shinpa heroine) sustains him. Thanks to an uncle’s intercession, Kiku gets to display his new skills in Tokyo, and Otoku slips away to let him reconcile with his stepfather. Kiku enj oys public acclaim at the very moment that she dies in a shabby boardinghouse.<sup>62</sup></p>
        <p>One turning point occurs when Kiku, left alone with Otoku, joins her in caring for a baby and eating watermelon. In one shot she carries the baby inside the house, sets him down under a protective net, and walks to the distant kitchen, barely visible in a slot (Fig. 3.72). Kiku follows (Fig. 3.73). The next shot, taken at a point 180 degrees to the first, shows Kiku and Otoku kneeling and silhouetted in the kitchen (Fig. 3.74). He slices watermelon for them while she flicks out the seeds with her hairpin. As they shift a bit further back to eat, he tells her he’s never been so happy as the night she told him the truth about his acting. She is moved and replies that she’ll do all she can to help him. Their quasi-love scene consists of his moving slightly toward Otoku and her lowering her head (Fig. 3.75). At this moment the family returns, and Kiku and Otoku draw apart (Fig. 3.76). Otoku hurries out left and returns, bending again but turning to watch Kiku’s aunt behind them. She pulls aside, as if worried she’s getting too close to Kiku, while Kiku (in an echo of the cowardly Nishimura) turns away, embarrassed (Figs . 3.77-3.78). In the next scene the aunt will fire Otoku.</p>
        <p>The dim foreground, characteristic of mid-r93os Mizoguchi, creates a threshold beyond which light traces a welter of crisscrossing planes. Thanks to a 180- degree camera shift, like that in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oyuki the Virgin</em>, the same area of the house is made to yield two rich fields of corridors and hideaways. As Kiku follows Otoku, she is barely visible in a distant aperture; in the reverse shot the distant plane is occupied by the baby. The arrangement allows Mizoguchi to present a delicate play of blocking and disclosing. When Kiku slides toward Otoku, his gesture takes place at screen center, masking the baby (Fig. 3.75). The family returns, and Otoku’s head withholds, then reveals, the arrival of Kiku’s aunt (Fig. 3.76). The same ballet is repeated when Otoku pulls away from Kiku and reveals the aunt, grimly unwrapping her obi (Fig. 3.77-3.78). As a whole the shot is at once busy and purified. The mazelike background and cluttered foreground are more dense with information than in most of Mizoguchi’s films before 1 936, yet the middle-ground drama is a suite of microactions conveying the warming of a man and a woman to each other. Nishimura’s slight slump in Naniwa Elegy has become an entire repertory of minute shifts of position.</p>
        <p>The full shot and long take yield not just apertures but pathways. Looking at the final image of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Poppy</em> (Fig. 3.46), we can recall the father’s and daughter’s trajectories. The stages of Ayakds humiliating confession in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> are implacably mapped out as phases of her progress through two rooms (Figs. 3.60-3.66). Thus can the dense, static image preserve the traces of the characters’ movements; cutting up the scene would wipe out these spatial memories. In our <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Chrysanthemum</em> scene the angle makes us notice how Kiku follows Otoku’s path to the kitchen, and in the reverse shot their traversal of this space hovers, ghostlike, behind them until Kiku’s aunt works her own variation on it. The plot actually builds a second moment on this spatial memory of brief intimacy. Years later, as the family celebrates Kiku’s triumphal return, he wanders into the same room. The baby is now a little boy. Kiku goes to the kitchen (Fig. 3.79), and in reverse shot we get another repetition. A cook is chopping bread where Otoku and Kiku had sat, and maids scurry about in silhouette (Fig. 3.80). Now the aunt comes in from a different angle and summons him to the party (Fig. 3.81). No need for a close-up of Kiku’s chagrin: our memory of the figures’ movement through these spaces echoes his awareness of the loss of the woman who enabled him to succeed.</p>
        <p>A third powerful moment, also foreshadowed by the first kitchen scene, comes after Kiku learns where the ill Otoku is staying. She has witnessed the performance that assures his fame, so she can die fulfilled. While her landlord Genshun fans her and a pulselike hammering comes from a neighborhood artisan’s shop, Kiku kneels beside her. In a shot lasting nearly six minutes, with no significant use of depth, Mizoguchi renders the tenderness of woman’s sacrifice and the man’s recognition of it, which always comes too late. Everything here turns on minute changes. Kiku passes to the left edge of Otoku’s pallet, and the camera obligingly arcs to resettle him. When Kiku says that they can now marry, she turns her head slightly and the fan stops (Fig. 3.82). Kiku insists she’ll get well, again Genshun ceases fanning (now to wipe his eyes), and Kiku moves slightly so that his shadow falls on her face (Fig. 3.83). The fan stops and starts; she tells Kiku to go to his public; he hesitates. Otoku stretches out her arm, whispering, “<span>I’m your wife now, with your parents’ permission!</span>” (Fig. 3. 84). He bends close over her, pauses, and then moves even closer-the nearest he has been to her in the entire film (Fig. 3.85). He agrees to go, rising and pausing with his back to us (naturally), then leaves, pausing to look back. Otoku twists her head just a bit to see him as he says: “<span>Wait for me</span>” (Fig. 3.86). As he and Genshun go out, Genshun’s daughter resumes fanning.</p>
        <p>After all the shots draped in darkness, all the labyrinths exposed behind the kabuki stage, all the intricate blocking and revealing of barely visible depths, Kiku’s farewell to Otoku offers a heightened simplicity. Compared to the nuances of posture, gaze, and aspect here, the couple’s byplay in the kitchen looks broad. Yet that byplay, and many others like it, have prepared us to see much in little, and now Mizoguchi tests our training. He strips his setting, his composition, and the performances to the drama’s emotional core. He seems determined to discover how much expressiveness he can summon up from the simplest ingredients-faces and barely moving bodies observed at a discreet distance.</p>
        <p>The same blend of density and purity pervades <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em>: within massive castles and corridors, solemnly moving figures and grand tracking shots achieve very gradual changes of angle and aspect. The wartime swordplay films <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miyamoto Musashi</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Famous Sword Bijomaru</em> occasionally offer kindred, if paler and less demanding, moments of pictorial gravity. Forged under new political demands for cultural sobriety, Mizoguchi’s style accorded well with a “<span>national aesthetic</span>” compounded of Zen and other signs of sacred traditions.<sup>63</sup> For us its place in the history of cinematic staging lies in its expressive ambitions. In seeking to mesmerize the viewer by dwelling on tiny gestures within richly packed spaces, Mizoguchi’s images become at once reserved and moving, sumptuous and austere.</p>
        <p>At the war’s end the Allied occupation, led by the United States, began to remake Japan. MacArthur and his staff reformed the Diet, strengthened political parties, broke up conglomerates, gave land to peasants, legalized labor unions , and expanded women’s rights.<sup>64</sup> Occupation authorities forced all filmmakers to avoid “<span>feudal</span>” subjects (no more swordplay movies) and authorized only films that illustrated liberal and democratic values. Under this system Mizoguchi made several films that more or less overtly promoted the new ideology. Two were guardedly optimistic affirmations of women’s rights: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Victory of Women</em> (1946), which centered on a woman lawyer defending a mother charged with causing her baby’s death, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Love Has Been Burning</em> (1949), the story of a Meiji era feminist. In somewhat the same vein was <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Love of Sumako the Actress</em> (1947), based on one of the most colorful women of the l910s. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro and His Five Women</em> (1946) presented the woodblock artist as a man of the people, scorning aristocratic patronage and recording the fugitive charms of the “<span>floating world</span>” of brothels and teahouses. Believing that Japanese culture had encouraged people to suppress affection, Occupation censors encouraged filmmakers to break sexual taboos; soon the first films to show kissing were released.<sup>65</sup> To this trend Mizoguchi contributed <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Women of the Night</em> (1948), a neorealistic cross-section of women forced to sell sex amid the rubble of a starving Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Many critics, at the time and since, have dismissed most of these films as weakened by their propagandistic purposes,<sup>66</sup> but all are of interest to the student of filmic storytelling and style. The stories are occasionally thin and didactic, but the passions run high, and the mise-en-scene is usually admirable. To a certain extent the 1946-1950 films also constitute a new phase of experimentation. If we call the earliest films eclectic and the 1936-1945 films ascetic (as well as, curiously, replete), we can see the immediate postwar years as a phase of intelligent, somewhat extroverted pluralism. For one thing the emotions are less contained; there is less sobbing and more shrieking. Mizoguchi admitted that he was now making more “<span>barbarous</span>” films, claiming that he had to release the resentment he felt toward wartime authorities.<sup>67</sup> Moreover, now this director knows what he can do best. He will never return to the wild days of quick montage. In the wake of Welles many directors were embracing aggressive foregrounds, but Mizoguchi withdrew to other terrain. Secure in his repertoire of staging strategies, he now carefully extends them. He subtly tests boundaries, tackles fresh tasks , and flexes his craft. The films of the late forties are made by a man in his late forties, and he brings to them a confidence not quite ready to settle into routine.</p>
        <p>So, for instance, he tries out new patterns of staging in relation to camera movement. In most of his prior work he had tracked characters laterally through a space or, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em>, swooped and spiraled around fixed figures. One nearly eight-minute shot in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Victory of Women</em> (1946) achieves a spike of expressive power through figures driving abruptly toward the camera, forcing it back, only to retreat abruptly into the distance before returning to the foreground (Figs. 3.87-3.89). The close framing and thrusting action here offer a remarkable reversal of the principles informing Ayakds confession in Naniwa Elegy, yielding not muted pathos but almost hysterical passion. Another rearward tracking shot acquires different dimensions in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Love Has Been Burning</em>. Here the heroine tries to reach her lover after a meeting of his political party. As he and his cronies descend a stair and stride expansively toward us, she plays hide -and-seek with the retreating camera (Figs. 3.90-3.91). Mizoguchi’s characteristic game of vision has turned symbolic, putting the feminist, the true progressive, on the periphery of men’s making of history.</p>
        <p>No such splendid camera movements grace <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Love of Sumako the Actress</em>, which harks back to the opacity and asceticism of the late 1930s. It consists largely of long shots—deep, dark, uncommunicative images that swallow up the characters . But there are also a few closer views, and these participate in a carefully judged pattern across the film. One might expect that the theater scenes would be handled in wide shots, the offs creen drama in close -ups. Almost willfully, however, Mizoguchi reserves the closest shots of Sumako for performances or rehearsals, as if to sharpen the difference between theater and life. After the death of her mentor and lover, Sumako kneels at her shrine to him and asks him how her performance was tonight (Fig. 3.92). Getting no answer, she doubles over, then shrinks from the camera, as if trying to press herself through the wall (Fig. 3.93). Now dorsality and a retreat from the camera express not shame but loss and fearful solitude. Sumako’s suicide will take place off screen, but this scene does duty for it, showing her pain pushing her into oblivion.</p>
        <p>Yet the purely private emotion seen here is abruptly countermanded. The next shot is a blunt medium close-up of Sumako onstage as Carmen, facing the camera and brandishing her rose (Fig. 3.94). Her aggressiveness seethes through the rest of the scene, with her voice and gestures trembling on the verge of hysteria. Soon she will frantically hurl an actor to the floor backstage; as Carmen she will be stabbed; and after the curtain falls, she will hang herself. The harsh shot-change marks the stylistic registers distinguishing the offstage drama from the performances, while immediately suggesting Sumakds swing between despair and defiance. She is at once a Japanese woman still looking to her <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sensei</em> for approval and a Carmen-like artist finding giddy liberation in a burst of creative energy.</p>
        <p>Mizoguchi’s willingness to blend his more muted staging patterns (retreats from the camera, glimpsed bits of action, distant obj ects of significance) with strategic close-ups is apparent in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro a.nd His Five Women</em>. A better title would be a straight rendition of the Japanese: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Five Women Surrounding Utamaro</em>. The famous Edo print designer sits at the center of the plot, threading five lives together. The least important is Oshin, his publisher’s fiancee. There are also Yukie, a painter’s daughter thrown over by Utamards disciple Seinosuke, and Orin, the lovely woman with whom Seinosuke eventually elopes. There is Takasode, whose ravishing back inspires Utamaro to design a tattoo for her. Most important is Okita, who seduces Seinosuke but also competes with Takasode for the favors of the vacant, beautiful boy Shozaburo. The shifting love triangles overlap on Utamaro and his passion for glorifying the female form. The film’s actual title not only evokes his gravitational pull on other fates but also recalls the original artist’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bijin-ga</em> (“<span>beauty pictures</span>”), which included many series based on numbers (“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Six Selected Types of Love</span>”, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Ten Studies in Female Physiognomy</span>”).</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro</em> vividly illustrates the new pluralism of Mizoguchi’s early postwar work. Plenty of scenes exploit reticent depths, as when Take tries to retrieve the drunken Seinosuke from Okita (Fig. 3.95). When Uta draws Oran for the first time, the shot employs both an aperture and a screen that tease us with glimpses of this extraordinary beauty (Fig. 3.96). Yet Mizoguchi sets himself new problems as well. How, he asks in effect, can one coordinate several people crisscrossing a fixed frame? The initial drawing duel between Utamaro and Seinosuke conveys brisk energy by stitching a welter of differently paced trajectories through layers of depth, with superbly synchronized pauses. The film’s final scene, as Utamaro returns from prison and starts to draw again, offers another instance of effortless group choreography (Figs. 3.97-3.100). Mizoguchi can now handle crowds without resorting to stasis or to solemn unison movements (as sometimes in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em>).</p>
        <p>His long shots radiate the assurance that they can render any rhythm, any dramatic turn. When Mizoguchi cuts up a scene into closer views, he is self-consciously pursuing particular ends. Granted, Yoda records that Mizoguchi said, “<span>I hate close-ups</span>”.<sup>68</sup> But we do have him noting in 1952: “<span>Close-ups can’t be avoided. Though long shots can convey psychological conflicts, close-ups are indispensable for more complicated nuances</span>”.<sup>69</sup> The close -ups in his earliest films were usually brief, simply composed in the American manner, and part of a string of reverse shots or eyeline matches. In the 1930s the close-up became more complex, as an aggressive foreground or, as at the close of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> and at moments in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters of Gion</em>, a singularized image standing out from the surrounding long shots. One scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro</em> shows Mizoguchi experimenting with the sustained close view “<span>for more complicated nuances</span>”.</p>
        <p>Okita (Tanaka Kinuyo) has stabbed both her feckless lover, Shozaburo, and her rival, the tattooed Takasode. She staggers into Utamards lodgings , where she confesses her crime and says farewell. The scene consists of two shots, the first running two minutes and eighteen seconds, the second running almost four minutes. The whole action is simple and symmetrical, structured on a coming/staying/departing pattern. Okita enters via the porch, and the camera follows her leftward in medium shot (Fig. 3.101) to confront Utamaro and his housemates. The bulk of the scene consists of her confession, broken by the scene’s only cut. Then Okita rises, determined to surrender to the police, and goes out, followed in a rightward tracking shot and the film’s biggest close-up (Fig. 3.102). Others rush to follow her out, but Utamaro stays behind, writhing in his handcuffs and gasping, “<span>I want so much to drawl</span>” Like Mizoguchi himself, Utamaro seeks the expressive image: Okita’s suffering lends her the pathetic beauty he longs to capture.</p>
        <p>The close-ups leading Okita in and out of the room bookend a remarkable stretch of staging, itself also filmed at fairly close range. Once she is in the room, Utamaro asks if she has gone mad. She drops to her knees before him and denies it (Fig. 3.103). Then Okita’s sister and Yukie come in to squat behind her. After declaring that she won’t accept a lukewarm love, Okita slides toward Utamaro, demanding: “<span> Doesn’t your portrait of me express the same thought ?</span>” (Fig. 3.I04). On the line Mizoguchi cuts to a medium close-up (Fig. 3.105).</p>
        <p>The cut underscores the dialogue point: Okita acknowledges that Utamards art has captured her heedless search for perfect love. Curiously, though, the cut shifts us only a little closer to the action and without a change of angle. Eisenstein and other Soviet directors had exploited this sort of axial cut, and so had Kurosawa, but in the sound era most directors avoided it because it makes the scene jump out a bit spasmodically at the viewer. And here the change of scale is so slight that we don’t doubt that Mizoguchi could have sustained the previous shot. So why this new framing ? Evidently Mizoguchi does not want Utamaro to be visible in the next phase of the action, which will center on Okita. Yet to have Utamaro pull away from her would be out of character, for he is keenly concerned about her fate. So the cut simply chops him out, at least until the climax of the shot. And for reasons that will become clear, Mizoguchi cuts directly in because he wants to preserve the slightly downward angle.</p>
        <p>The rest of the scene (traced in Figs. 3.106-3.112) reminds us of what Feuillade already knew: close framings need not simply carry one piece of information, such as a character’s facial reaction (Figs . 2.74-2.75). Mizoguchi’s prolonged medium close-up can offer some of the same expressive resonances we find in shots like Otoku’s death in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Chrysanthemum</em>. He builds Okita’s confession out of minimal movements (her turning of her head or sliding a few inches left or right), with other faces concealed by being offscreen (Utamaro, Take), by being blocked by Okita, or by being lowered (the women behind her). The closer view can also aid the hypnotic effect Mizoguchi seeks . He shifts our attention from point to point through focus changes and the upturned faces of Yukie and the sister before creating a climax out of Okita’s thrusting her face closer to Utamards than ever before. (The tactic echoes Kikugords bending over the dying Otoku.) Now we can understand the final ambivalent close-up of the departing Okita as the pictorial crescendo, aimed at clinching the “<span>complicated nuances</span>” of her state of mind (Fig. 3.I02). And the high angle that Mizoguchi retains after the cut-in closer view keeps the other women in the action so that their reactions offer poignant echoes of Okita’s confession. The shot may also allude to the “<span>corner illusion</span>” central to Japanese art: the view looking downward into a room, with figures arranged to hide the joints among walls, floors, and screens.<sup>70</sup> This portrait of an Edo artist may also be quoting the schemas at which he was so adept.</p>
        <p>When the American occupiers departed in 52, Japan’s film industry was in high-speed growth. Despite US efforts to break up conglomerates, six major studios ruled, with five controlling theater chains. The firms quickly reinstated the “<span>feudal</span>” swordplay films (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">chanbara</em>) and expanded their lines of romances and comedies. Output swelled from about two hundred titles in </span>”50 to more than five hundred in 1956, reestablishing the Japanese film industry as the world’s most prolific.</p>
        <p>Several generations competed on this crowded field. Ozu, Naruse, Gosho, and other senior directors maintained the piecemeal- decoupage tradition in the protective shadow of studios like Shochiku and Toho. Men who had started directing during the China war, such as Kurosawa, Kinoshita Keinosuke, and Imai Tadashi, came to the fore, as did slightly younger ones like Ichikawa Kon, Kobayashi Masaki, and Shindo Kaneto. Many directors eagerly embraced the wide-angle, deep-focus aesthetic that was becoming an international norm, complete with aggressive foregrounds. A few younger directors occasionally incorporated dense compositions on the model of prewar pictorialism, as well as displaying one -off visual innovations. (Kurosawa excelled in the latter.) Most of the young men proved versatile, shifting among various genres and techniques ; none, it appears, probed a core of stylistic premises from film to film.</p>
        <p>In these circumstances Mizoguchi could only appear a throwback. Still widely respected, he was nonetheless obliged to shift among studios, adapting novels and often adding the sexual ingredients of which the Occupation approved. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Picture of Madame Yuki</em> (l950) a wife raped by her husband guiltily derives satisfaction from his brutality. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miss Oyu</em> (1951) concentrates on a discreet menage a trois. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lady of Musashino</em> (1951) a man drawn to a former lover punishes her by flirting with younger women. Mizoguchi’s work had often featured eroticism, but these films-and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ugetsu Monogatari</em> (1953), with Lady Wakasa’s dreamworld of sensuality-flaunted it. Even with such concessions he declared himself unable to understand the tastes of the young audience.<sup>71</sup></p>
        <p>He was rescued by his old friend Nagata Masaichi. Nagata’s Daiei company held few screens, so after <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rashomon</em> (1950) won the top prize at Venice and the Academy Award for best foreign film, Daiei aimed at the overseas market. Although Japan was still sunk in poverty, with one-tenth of the per capita income of the United States, it became the first Asian country to gain worldwide attention for its cinema. Festivals paid tribute to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mother</em> (1952), Where <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chimneys Are Seen</em> (1953), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Samurai</em> (1953), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Burmese Harp</em> (1956). Kinugasa’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gate of Hell</em> (1954) earned two Academy Awards, one for best foreign film, the other for best costume design-an event unthinkable even a few years before.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the festival market, Mizoguchi’s fortunes changed. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oharu</em> ranked only ninth in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kinema Jumpo</em> poll, but it won the top prize at Venice in 1952. He left the Shintoho studio for Daiei, which backed all his subsequent projects . <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ugetsu</em>, placing third in the poll and earning another grand prize at Venice, clinched his status. He could now command important subjects and big budgets. After <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sansho the Bailiff’s</em> Venice win in 1954, Mizoguchi joined the Daiei board of directors. He was not completely free of studio interference or the occasional forced project (for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Princess Yang Kwei Fei</em>, 1955, a coproduction with Hong Kong ), and his films still attracted little attention at the local box office. But for a year or two after <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oharu</em>, critics looked more favorably on his work, which screened at festivals and began to enter overseas markets. In 1954 Mizoguchi received an Education Ministry award for lifetime achievement.</p>
        <p>The very end, however, was not so sunny. He suffered from leukemia in his final years , and he was quite feeble during the filming of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Street of Shame</em> (1956). His last three films—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Princess Yang Kwei Fei, Shin Heike Monogatari</em> (1956), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Street of Shame</em>—did not place in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kinema Jumpo</em> poll because, one observer suggests, most critics considered them “<span>purely commercial efforts, overestimated by westerners</span>”.<sup>72</sup> His Daiei works struck many as kitschy exoticism catering to the growing festival circuit. Indeed, Mizoguchi’s postwar output brought his entire career into question. Writers suggested that he was a romantic pessimist, since his films on social issues dramatized ills without offering cures.<sup>73</sup> Many younger critics promoted left-wing social-problem directors like Imai Tadashi, whose films consistently beat Mizoguchi’s in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kinema Jumpo</em> rankings. Older critics continued to prefer Ozu, Naruse, and Gosho, who found poignancy shining out of commonplace lives. Mizoguchi’s aristocratic elegance, along with his taste for shinpa dramaturgy, had become old-fashioned.</p>
        <p>Those who thought him behind the times had their opinion confirmed by his admiration for classical art. He often compared film to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">e-makimono</em>, the picture scroll that unrolled a scene.<sup>74</sup> Like other directors of monumental <em class="notranslate" translate="no">jidai-geki</em>, he had already quoted the bird’s- eye view characteristic of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">e-makimono</em> and picture screens (Fig. 3.71). The lakeside romp of the princess and the potter in Ugetsu was modeled on a landscape drawn from Ogata Korin, one of the most famous seventeenth-century painters.<sup>75</sup> Unlike most of the directors praised by 1950s critics he clung to the pictorialism of the 1930s, when he and his contemporaries were exploring distinctively Japanese shot designs. In a 1952 interview he spoke of admiring the “<span>density</span>” of Japanese art; he found in ink paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth century “<span>an enormous suggestive intensity that I often wish I could get into a film</span>”.<sup>76</sup></p>
        <p>He seems not to have regarded his Japanese contemporaries as serious rivals. He saw William Wyler as his only competition on the festival scene, and he fretted that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Roman Holiday</em> would beat <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ugetsu</em> at Venice. When he watched a Wyler film, he timed the scenes and shots.<sup>77</sup> Yet he seems not to have worried about competition in the long-take sweepstakes (his shots were already far lengthier than Wyler’s or virtually anyone else’s ). He told Yoda that he admired Wyler’s “<span>vertical framing</span>” -presumably his low-angle depth shots, which pile faces from bottom to top.<sup>78</sup> By studying Wyler, Mizoguchi seems to have been considering ways he could squeeze still more into every image.</p>
        <p>Is this competition or co- optation? Noel Burch has proposed that after <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Love of the Actress Sumako</em> Mizoguchi brought his work into line with “<span>one of the dominant tendencies in Hollywood at that time: the long take <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a la</em> Wyler</span>”.<sup>79</sup> He identifies Mizoguchi’s “<span>representational system</span>” with “<span>radical camera distance, long takes, dolly movements</span>” and then claims that these evolved into “<span>an academically decorative, opportunistic approach to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">decoupage</em>, contrived by laying certain traits of his earlier system over the framework of the Hollywood codes</span>”.<sup>80</sup> For example, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro</em> “<span>the long take is largely subservient to the Western codes and there are frequent close-ups . . . . One observes both the temptation of the codes from the conquering West and the nostalgia for an exemplary past of personal and national rigour</span>”.<sup>81</sup></p>
        <p>Yet the techniques Burch itemizes aren’t the whole of Mizoguchi’s style. He was for most of his career a variegated stylist (180-degree cutting patterns versus single-shot scenes, big foreground close-ups versus empty-foreground depth shots).<sup>82</sup> For Burch, to rupture a distant shot with a close -up is to risk surrendering to Western norms; but Mizoguchi was surrendering since the 1920s, albeit in distinctive ways. The “<span>Hollywood codes</span>” were his point of departure throughout his career, along with more idiosyncratic schemas he shared with his colleagues. Ironically, one could make a case that Mizoguchi most fully embraced Western norms in low-budget wartime efforts like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miyamoto Musashi</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Famous Sword Bijomaru</em>. But then Burdis belief that Occupation forces (“<span>the conquering West</span>”) steered Japanese directors toward Hollywood would come into question.</p>
        <p>We shouldn’t forget that even in the 1950s no other filmmaker, apparently not in Japan and certainly not in the United States, was making films as complex in their staging as Mizoguchi’s. The disparaging comparison with Wyler or Cukor becomes implausible when we look at the staging of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Best Years of Our Lives</em> (1945) or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Marrying Kind</em> (1952)fine films but worlds away from the precision and delicacy we find even in a lesser Mizoguchi film like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gion Festival Music</em> (1953). Let us also recall that Mizoguchi’s purportedly code -complicitous films were received with boredom or annoyance by Western critics who had not embraced the mise-en-scene aesthetic. Of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chikamatsu Monogatari</em> Ado Kyrou complained: “<span>The direction is flat. The camera keeps its distance; it is too polite. Good films cannot be made without close-ups</span>”.<sup>83</sup> Of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ugetsu</em> Paul Rotha wrote that by developing his action in long shots Mizoguchi becomes “<span>a pedestrian filmmaker</span>”.<sup>84</sup></p>
        <p>He was nearly always more pluralistic within the long-take tradition than critics allowed: he tested his staging along many dimensions (varieties of shot scale, degrees of depth, fixity versus mobile camera, static figures versus figure movement). The idiom of his last phase, I think it fair to say, is closer to that of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taki no Shiraito</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oyuki the Virgin</em> than the severity of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Chrysanthemum</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Genroku Chushingura</em>. If one takes those exercises in austerity as a benchmark, then anything that is more diversified will look compromised. Although I, too, am thrilled by the pushing of limits, to elevate this to a criterion of excellence seems too narrow a view of style. Simply refusing the close-up is no guarantee of artistic purity (as witness the lumbering procession of “<span>minimalist</span>” films since the 1970s). Stylistic rigor can become rigor mortis. The critic’s task is to weigh functions and effects, and in Okita’s confession to Utamaro (Figs. 3.101-3.112) we have already seen how a closer view can powerfully coordinate an ensemble of details.</p>
        <p>It is true that by 1950 Mizoguchi seems to have solved the principal problems he posed himself. He had created one “<span>distinctively Japanese</span>” style that could answer to various cultural demands, from pride in artistry to political nationalism. He had shown that riches lay hidden in pictorial schemas his colleagues often left unmined. He had created a hypnotic cinema centered on the dense image, governed by unpredictable spatial developments and slightly changing details. He had made the sustained shot discreetly expressive through shinpa conventions and nuanced performances. Seen from this standpoint, the last films present distillations of his characteristic staging strategies. They also continually recall his formative era. None of his peers preserved so integrally, as if in an archive, prewar achievements in shot design. Whereas Kurosawa and others created a muscular technique out of the calligraphic impulses of earlier years (freely borrowing from Soviet and Hollywood films), Mizoguchi’s long takes reactivate, with subtle variations, a panoply of pictorialist imagery. In this sense he is a conservative, but what he conserves becomes in his hands an inexhaustible resource.</p>
        <p>In the 1930s and 1940s he had refined current schemas; now he refines his refinements. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ugetsu Monogatari</em> uses his veiling effects to evoke the supernatural (Fig. 3.113 ). In l947’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro and His Five Women</em> he had shown Okita grabbing a knife to wreak her vengeance, treating the action in an aperture framing and an almost expressionistic shadow (Figs. 3.l14-3.115). <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Life of Oharu</em>, as we’ve seen, almost completely conceals the knife, then flashes it along the frame edge, barely visible (Fig. 3.10). In other films he stretches his love of lattices in fresh directions (Figs. 3.116-3.118). He also sets himself new problems. He multiplies the number of figures whose faces he can hide while pushing the action at ever-increasing distance from the camera (Figs. 3.119-3.120). Otoku’s death scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Chrysanthemum</em> had put her feeble facial turns at the center of a sparse frame (Figs. 3.82-3.83); but what, our director seems to be asking, if Lady Musashino expires in a more crowded frame, with her face even tinier than btoku’s and changing its position ever so slightly (Figs. 3.121-3.122) ?</p>
        <p>If this be academicism, make the most of it. Let every young filmmaker take any late Mizoguchi film and watch. Let the student see how what is most significant can arrive effortlessly before us, often by the smallest resettling of figures or the simplest panning movement. Let the student observe how what is most dramatically important can shrink or hide itself-sometimes unobtrusively, sometimes in full view. Let the student plot how earlier phases of the action leave their traces in pathways and pigeonholes, to be reactivated when needed (often when least expected). If the student wants the camera to move (as all do), let him or her observe the timing by which a simple tracking shot permits figures, setting, and framing to align, swerve apart, and reconverge: a compact choreography of delicate changes, with no pictorial dead spots and none of that hurly-burly of today’s walk-and-talks. And above all let the student consider how almost every image grasps our attention as a splendid composition (which you want to explore in fine detail), a vessel of dramatic conflict (which you scan for glances, facial expressions, compositional confrontations, imminent arrivals), and a tensely contained emotional field (which may erupt into violence or crumple into a zone of private feeling ). The “<span>enormous suggestive intensity</span>” that Mizoguchi admired in Japanese art lies coiled and waiting for us in scene after scene of his late films. In an era when “<span>visual literacy</span>” means taking for granted those bursts of pointless cutting that purportedly energize a scene, Mizoguchi (like Ozu, but in a different way) gives us time to see everything. We could do worse than to treat this oeuvre as an Academy for the Study of Staging.</p>
        <p>His last film makes a good postgraduate exercise. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Street of Shame</em> has converging plotlines in the vein of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Utamaro</em>, but now the point of intersection is a brothel. As the parliament debates the abolition of prostitution, six women are linked through their work at Dreamland, in the Yoshiwara district of Tokyo. One supports a sick husband and a baby; another has a grown son who is ashamed of her; another is out to bilk men. Into this sordid tangle struts Mickey, the :fifties equivalent of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">moga of Naniwa Elegy</em>. Sashaying in her tight skirt, flipping her ponytail, scrambling after every customer, smoking and chewing gum and nibbling snacks (sometimes all at the same time), Mickey brings postwar vulgarity to Dreamland’s echt-neoclassical house of pleasure. While offering bitter hu- . mor and genuine pathos, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Street of Shame</em> provides a tutorial in how to stage groups. We have adjacent rooms and apertures laying out scenes (Fig. 3.123). We have apparently casual shots that exfoliate into richly articulated planes, and we have bold compositions in flamboyant depth stretching out from a middle ground, activated by the slightest movement (Figs . 3.124-3.125). The idea of the simple close -up here loses nearly all meaning; even near shots are packed with information (Fig. 3.126).</p>
        <p>At the film’s close the young serving girl Shizuko-a minor character until now—is dressed and made up to take her first customer. She is sent outside, and Mickey shows her how to catch a man’s attention. Offscreen a radio announcer reports that once more the antiprostitution bill has been defeated. After glancing this way and that, Shizuko timidly peeks out at us from behind a pillar (Fig. 3.127), then ducks partway back (Fig. 3.128). In finally bringing us to a close view of a character, the shot recalls the last image of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naniwa Elegy</em> (Fig. 3-47). But this image is more sustained, and it passes through a suite of small mutations. Shizuko’s expression shifts quickly from shyness to childish excitement to fearful uncertainty to . . . what ? It is a searing shot with which to end a film, let alone a career.</p>
        <p>No long take, no distant framing, no camera movement, no chiaroscuro. How Mizoguchian can this image be? Utterly. For one last time the game of vision, now borne by a single darting eye, traces exquisite modulations of emotion.</p>
