        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Angelopoulos, Or Melancholy</h2>
        <p>Theodoros Angelopoulos may be the last believer in a cinema of heroic statement. His films put on display characteristic agonies of modem civilization-totalitarian regimes, the misery of the stateless immigrant, the disenchantment of the Left. They search for the roots of these conditions in history or, as he sometimes puts it in interviews, History.<sup>1</sup> Each film presents a journey, he asserts , “<span>and the journey embraces all the human emotions from love and sexuality to hate and war</span>”.<sup>2</sup> He freights his scenes with mythological references (citations of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Odyssey</em> or Attic tragedy) and portentous symbols. He draws his dialogue from the poetry of Homer, Eliot, and George Seferis. He employs allegory and iconography with shameless literalness, dramatizing political conflict through a flurried dance of street banners , or representing the end of a political movement by a drifting barge draped with flags. He doesn’t think twice about having the same performer play several parts or suggesting that the action is all taking place in the mind of a character (a filmmaker, no less)-as if he hasn’t heard that these tricks went out with platform shoes and mood rings. He works on the edge of embarrassment. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em> (1995) a colossal head of Lenin is loaded onto a barge and then floats down the Danube to a somber musical score (Plate 4.1); the sequence, Angelopoulos tells us, marks the death of Communism for him and his generation.<sup>3</sup> His admirers believe that he can capture modem anguish in monumental imagery; for others it is all bombast.</p>
        <p>Indeed, part of the fascination of Angelopoulos’s cinema is its almost naive anachronism. This filmmaker, so attuned. to history (or History), so sensitive to post-Communist emigration and the war in the Balkans, appears unaware of how dated his artistic ambitions seem. He can with a straight face propose a trilogy on nothing less than the history of the twentieth century, keyed to the myths of Oedipus and Antigone.<sup>4</sup> Oblivious to fashion, he never seems to worry that his films will seem ponderous and overwrought. No postmodern pastiche, tone switching, or self-ironizing here. He will not make a playful reference to anything; every moment strives to resonate deeply. His lifelong passion for the poetry of Greek masters like Seferis and Cafavy and the novels of Faulkner, Joyce, and Stendhal have given his films literary aspirations. Mass culture appears as a vulgar scrawl on the landscape (the pop song in the dingy cafe in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beekeeper</em>), and cinema is cited only in its gravest mode (Murnau, Dreyer, Bergman). Growing up in an era when solemn filmmaking was the best proof that cinema could be as exalted an art as poetry, theater, and the novel, Angelopoulos has embraced all those subjects that are difficult to lighten up: war, repression, the failure of love. Pretentiousness is the risk he runs for believing that only high seriousness is worthy of his medium and of the questions an artist must ask.</p>
        <p>I may as well confess my divided affection for these sprawling, maj estic, irritating works. Certain of them ( for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em>; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eternity and a Day</em>, 1998) seem to me deeply flawed, inflating their thematic statement at the expense of narrative density. Others, such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> (1975) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunters</em> (1977), are remarkable accomplishments, but often they read better in critical commentary than they play on the screen. Four, however—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander the Great</em> (1980), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em> (1983), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em> (1988), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Suspended Step of the Stork</em> (1991)—seem to me authentic masterpieces, attaining grandeur without becoming grandiose. Still, none of the films lacks awe-inspiring passages, and all sustain, sometimes brilliantly, that tradition of staging and shooting that is the concern of this book. If I treat Angelopoulos as more a synthesizer than an innovator, that takes nothing from his achievement. In today’s thintextured European cinema, where formulaic decoupage and big close -ups rule nearly as much as in Hollywood, at least one stubbornly highfalutin artist tries to keep alive the rich, evocative image.</p>
        <blockquote>I think that other Greek directors don’t have the same problems as I do. Being Greek, I am a part of Greek cinema, but not in the localized, provincia l sense; and as far as style is concerned, there’s no meetin g point. Theo Angelopoulos<sup>5</sup></blockquote>
        <p>Born in Athens in 1936, Angelopoulos spent his youth in the years of World War II and the Greek civil war (1946-1949). After taking a law degree and serving in the military, he went to Paris in the early 1960s to study film. Back in Athens he began writing film journalism for the left-wing newspaper <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Democratic Change</em>. In 1967 a cadre of generals took over the government and installed Colonel George Papadopoulos as national leader. Angelopoulos began his movie career under the junta, working as actor and associate producer on several films and shooting his first film, the short <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Broadcast</em>, in 1968. Despite the oppressive political climate, a group of young directors emerged in the late 1960s and were able to circumvent censorship somewhat. Military factions controlled the government until 1974, the year before Angelopoulos’s international breakthrough with his third feature, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em>. Since then he has been the most famous Greek director and one of the most honored filmmakers in the world.</p>
        <p>Angelopoulos and his generation worked in conditions very different from that of Greek cinema’s golden age. Out of the rubble of World War II and the civil war, entrepreneurs built a small but thriving studio system. Production boomed, with over 250 films released in the 1950s and over l,400 during the 1960s. Comedies, musicals, melodramas, and pastoral dramas (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">foustanellas</em>), all filled with popular stars, brought audiences into the theaters. New sound stages were equipped to European standards, not only improving local quality but also luring in productions from abroad. A film school was founded in 1951, and an archive in 1957. The first national film festival was held at Thessaloniki (Salonika) in 1960. Greek films achieved export too, most notably with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Never on Sunday</em> (1961) and the dramas of Michael Cacoyannis (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Electra</em>, 1962; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zorba the Greek</em>, 1964), and Cacoyannis and other young directors became festival regulars. Even the arrival of the generals did not immediately stifle output, since the government financed historical films and patriotic spectacles.</p>
        <p>What local critics call the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Greek Cinema</span>” grew out of changes in film culture in the late 1960s. Cacoyannis and some other established directors fled the Papadopoulos regime, creating space for a new generation. In response to the dictatorship, and in harmony with New Left movements throughout the world, young directors began to commit themselves to a socially and politically critical cinema-at least as critical as could be sneaked by the censors. In addition, national television arrived in 1971 and immediately triggered a steep decline in filmgoing. In 1968 annual admissions had hit an all-time high of 137 million; by 1973, admissions were only 70 million. As the commercial cinema flagged, the New Greek Cinema offered artistic films of personal vision. The spearhead was Angelopoulos’s initial feature, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> (1970), which won four awards at Thessaloniki and became identified as the first mature work of the rising generation. Directors bypassed the studio system and garnered funding from French, Italian, and US companies, as well as the Greek Film Center, founded in 1980.<sup>6</sup></p>
        <p>Despite accolades and subsidies, the New Cinema did not win back the audience. Admissions continued to plummet; by 1 9 93 the annual figure stood at seven million. One or two dozen films were made each year, but American movies, along with a few French and Italian imports, ruled the box office. Virtually no Greeks went to Greek films, let alone to the recondite works of Angelopoulos and his peers . Their films circulated primarily on the festival circuit, which, however informal and decentralized, was becoming the only international distribution network comparable to Hollywood’s. Angelopoulos no longer entered his films in competition at Thessaloniki, partly out of concern for dominating the awards and partly because his proper venue was Cannes.</p>
        <p>Angelopoulos’s career has a self-fashioned unity characteristic of a 1970s filmmaker aspiring to high artistry. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> offers a critical look at dying Greek villages . His next four films set out to trace his nation’s modern history. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Days of 36</em> (1972) examines the dictatorial rule of General Metaxas (1937-1941), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> loops back and forth between the period of Nazi occupation and postwar civil strife. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunters</em> revives the years from the civil war (1944-1949) to the mid-196os through an arresting narrative device: present- day hunters find the corpse of a civil war partisan, as fresh as if killed yesterday. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander the Great</em> completes the cycle by surveying the period from the turn of the century until the 1930s, tracing a bandit’s tyranny over a remote village organized as a commune.</p>
        <p>Throughout this tetralogy individuals tend to stand for larger forces, both political and mythological. The traveling players are named Electra, Orestes, and the like; Alexander the bandit is a brutish version of his legendary namesake; the hunters exist only as types identified with political positions. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em> marks a new stage in Angelopoulos’s oeuvre, since now political forces are embodied in more traditionally drawn characters: The elderly Communist Spyros, let out of prison, returns to his Macedonian village. This simple situation is refracted through the imagination of a film director who is meditating on a film proj ect and who will, in the film-within-the-film, find in Spyros a mythical father figure. Further meditations on solitude and age are presented in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beekeeper</em> (1986), about a schoolteacher and beekeeping enthusiast who abruptly abandons his family and embarks on an odyssey across a bleak, unyielding modern Greece. Landscape in the Mist offers another journey, following two children convinced that their father is waiting for them just across the border.</p>
        <p>Boundaries and migration come to the fore again in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Suspended Step of the Stork</em>. Visiting a town on the Albanian border jammed with war refugees, a television journalist believes he recognizes a prominent Greek politician who has disappeared. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em> projects the same concerns with borders in following an archivist (called simply ‘‘.A’’) in his search for a lost early film. A:s quest is at once a parallel to the Odyssey, a hazardous homecoming, a trip into his childhood via flashbacks to the 1940s, an interrogation of central European history since World War I, and a quest for the historical significance of the Balkans, all presented through A:s search for the “<span>first image</span>”, vanished footage from the turn of the century. The turbulence of Eastern Europe becomes even more personalized in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eternity and a Day</em>, in which a poet in the last days of his life reflects on his past while accompanying a young Albanian boy trying to return home.</p>
        <p>Like Feuillade and Mizoguchi, Angelopoulos brooks no contradiction on the set. “<span>He is the image of his Alexander</span>”, notes his longtime cinematographer Yorgos Arvanitis, “<span>who ended as a tyrant</span>”.<sup>7</sup> To achieve the rhythm the director demands, the actor must count silently between lines. In order to deflate the tourist ideal of Greece, Angelopoulos favors filming in winter, when rain and mists dominate; if the sun breaks out, he halts shooting. While making <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em>, “<span>I was persecuted by beautiful weather.<sup>8</sup> His search for majestic locales takes him to rough and remote places. The filming of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander the Great</em> in a poverty-stricken mountain village over a bitterly cold winter led to underfed extras and crews threatening to defect.<sup>9</sup> On location in the Yugoslavian town of Mostar during bombardment in the Balkan War, Angelopoulos refused to leave as ordered by authorities, until he got the footage he wanted. He has become an Odysseus, taking cast and crew all over his region. His most daunting expedition was, appropriately, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em>, which passed from Greece through Albania, Macedonia, Romania, and the Black Sea city of Constanza before ending up in Croatia, with Mostar standing in for Sarajevo</span>”. I believe something special happens on location, in the real place . . . . “<span>When I am in the place I have set the film, all five of my senses are working</span>”.<sup>10</sup></p>
        <p>. Historically, as well as geographically, the films sink their roots deep into Balkan culture, as Andrew Horton has shown in a careful study.<sup>11</sup> Yet by rendering the history of Greece and its neighbors through imagery culled from mythology, literature, and Marxist thought, Angelopoulos joined a broader tradition. He worked in a vein that was cosmopolitan and pan-European, aimed at an elite audience. From the start his films took prizes at major continental festivals, and soon they were financed by private companies and television chains in Italy, France, and Germany, as well as by EU agencies. In the 1980s and 1990s he relied on stars like Marcello Mastroianni, Jeanne Moreau, Harvey Keitel, and Bruno Ganz.</p>
        <p>Angelopoulos has thus kept alive a strain of European modernist filmmaking that runs back to the 1950s. But his historical situation obliged him to sustain the tradition with a new degree of self- consciousness. Inevitably, a filmmaker starting out in 1970 confronted problems that directors had not faced fifteen years earlier. He or she came belatedly to the modernist tradition, one that had already acquired a history, a pantheon of masters, a theoretical program, a rhetoric, and a set of institutions. In a tradition that prized originality, the novice who wanted to be a film artist was expected to create a strongly distinctive style; but that in turn required knowing what others had done. Because reputations were made principally on the festival circuit, the filmmaker had to find international financing and distribution and settle for minor festivals before arriving at one of the Big Three (Berlin, Cannes, Venice). Because critics’ comments weighed heavily, one had to offer them food for thought and participate in intellectually inclined interviews.</p>
        <p>Angelopoulos was well equipped to succeed in this situation. He passed through Paris in the crucial years 1961-1964, studying film and, he claims, getting thrown out of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques (IDHEC). Like most “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">young cinema</span>” directors, he came under the influence of what we might call the Langlois Cinematheque canon: auteurs such as Welles and Mizoguchi, Hollywood genres such as the crime film and the musical. The seriousness with which he takes the director’s vocation doubtless derives from the saliency of Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, and others in the cinephile culture of the 19 60s. Gods walked the earth then.</p>
        <p>Angelopoulos also grasped the need to shape critical appropriation of his films. A former critic himself, he gave interviews that help us to interpret his works, as when he explained that his own voice as the offscreen father at the beginning of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em> is related to the symbolic “<span>search for a father</span>” that rules the film.<sup>12</sup> He can come up with a lapidary formula that many critics would envy: “<span><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em></span>” evoked the silence of history, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beekeeper</em> the silence of love, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em> the silence of God.<sup>13</sup> He has assisted us in understanding the development of his work, tracing recurring preoccupations and new shifts of interest. He points out “<span>some very obvious obsessions</span>”: umbrellas, marriage ceremonies, certain names, the sea, the oscillation between dense images and empty ones, a preference for silences, and “<span>almost always, the presence of a little boy</span>”.<sup>14</sup></p>
        <p>So it is the filmmaker, not a gang of critics , who proposes that his work splits into two periods . First was a forthrightly political phase, in which under the influence of Marx and Brecht he sought to explore “<span>epic</span>” presentation without psychological identification. During his stay in Paris, he claims, Brecht became “<span>the essential reference point.<sup>15</sup> Then, beginning with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em>, came films that were more emotional and existentialist, rejecting the certainties of official politics. ‘‘Art has become anthropocentric again and asks more questions for which it has no answers</span>”.<sup>16</sup> His declaration of an ethically grounded humanism chimed well with post-Marxist attitudes of European intellectuals in the 1980s. I’m not suggesting that in packaging his oeuvre Angelopoulos is opportunistic; an artist’s help in deciphering his work is virtually demanded by festival cinema, which makes the director’s career development one of the film’s selling points.<sup>17</sup></p>
        <p>A cinephile in the Parisian mold, a thoughtful exegete of his own work, Angelopoulos also created a trademark technique. Like Bresson, Dreyer, and other classic stylists, he seems to “<span>process</span>” every script, passing the story action through a series of finely meshed filters to arrive at a distinctive string of images. Critics commonly point out that he relies on long shots, long takes, temps morts, and offscreen space, and he has discussed these techniques at length in his interviews.<sup>18</sup> At the time of his early work he claimed that the long takes and camera movements created a “<span>dialectic</span>” among different elements in the shot.<sup>19</sup> He thereby encouraged a Brechtian characterization of his styleone amenable to critical reception in the wake of late 1960s left aesthetics. Ten years later, however, asked if the sudden rain in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em> was aiming at a Brechtian distancing, he replied: “<span>Not for such reasons, but because artificial rain is very beautiful! It is as beautiful as natural rain</span>”.<sup>20</sup></p>
        <p>As Mizoguchi discovered in the 1950s, the festival circuit rewards individuality of subject and form. Angelopoulos quickly understood that his playing field was pan-European. He delved into concrete Greek issues, but he kept his films from looking provincial by using techniques already canonized in the international milieu. His effort, then and ever since, has been to achieve a localized cosmopolitanism, casting distinctive national material in sophisticated modernist shapes. He has experimented with flashbacks and ambiguous time schemes, devices canonized since the 1950s as signs of ambitious filmmaking. He has also cultivated a style that drains away narrative denotation to a considerable degree, pushing instead toward a muted expressivity and a monumental, near-abstract pictorial design.</p>
        <p>Angelopoulos’s response to his circumstances reflects a new stage in filmmakers’ stylistic self-consciousness. When Feuillade adopted ensemble staging in the sustained shot, he was following the norms of his milieu. When Mizoguchi embraced the technique, he was picking a secondary option, pursuing it beyond the norms of sound filming in order to refine it. But by the early 1 970s the long take had a distinguished pedigree, having been canonized not only in filmmaking practice but in the critical literature. Angelopoulos, along with contemporaries like Wim Wenders, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Chantal Akerman, Maurice Pialat, and Werner Herzog, knew the debate about mise-en-scene that Bazin had launched and that animated 1950s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> criticism. In Paris, during the early 1960s, Angelopoulos studied with Georges Sadoul and Jean Mitry, and he claims that while working as an usher at the Cinematheque he acquired his tastes. The films he admired reflect the Bazin-<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers</em> consensus: Murnau, Dreyer’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ordet</em> (1955), Welles (for his “<span>cutting in the camera</span>”), Renoir (for “<span>deep focus and parallel stories</span>”), Mizoguchi (like Sarris he was “<span>seeing many of his films without subtitles, just watching the image</span>”), and Antonioni.<sup>21</sup></p>
        <p>His first feature, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em>, turns “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">new cinema</span>” devices toward political critique. Kosta, a “<span>guest worker</span>”, returns from Germany to his tiny village, populated by fewer than a hundred women, children, and old men; virtually all the able-bodied young have found work abroad. Kosta is murdered by his wife, Eleni, and her lover Christos, and although they try to keep their crime a secret, gossip spreads about Kosta’s disappearance. Soon the police arrive. The lovers confess, each putting the blame on the other. Both are arrested, and the village’s women scramble to attack Eleni as she is hauled off in a police van.</p>
        <p>The story is not, however, told in the order I have just presented. The opening scenes show Kosta laboriously returning to his village and greeting his children (who don’t recognize him). The credits appear over a freeze -frame of the family having their first shared meal in years . Then we see police questioning Eleni in her home, and she declares that Christos strangled Kosta as she watched. The plot goes on to alternate fairly brief scenes of police investigation-the “<span>reconstruction</span>” of the title-with long episodes from the couple’s efforts to hide their crime. They bury Kosta’s body in the cottage’s garden, they flee town and spend a bleak night in the city, and eventually the police arrive, tipped off by a suspicious old woman. At the end, after Eleni and Christos are taken off, Angelopoulos provides an epilogue. He flashes back to the murder but keeps it off screen by holding the camera on the family cottage as the children play outside.</p>
        <p>This scrambled chronology reworks a template that has characterized European art cinema since the 1950s: the police-investigation-plus-flashbacks. Like Bertolucci’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Commare secca</em> (1962), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> uses detection to juggle time and shift point of view, letting us know the outcome straightaway in order to explore the causes leading up to it. Instead of providing psychological motivation-Eleni and Christos are barely characterized, and the final shot carefully prevents us from ascribing passion to the crime-the structure evokes a broader social critique. The flashbacks suggest that Kosta’s death grows out of the village’s frustrating poverty. The film “<span>reconstructs</span>” the social pressures leading to domestic infidelity and murder-a point underscored in a sequence showing journalists circulating through town while we hear, as voice - over commentary, guest workers in Germany explaining why they fled Greece.<sup>22</sup></p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> exploits several visual techniques typical of the 1960s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">young cinemas</span>”. Angelopoulos insists on shooting on location, confining his camera to cramped interiors and providing glimpses of a tavern or bus terminal. The cinema verite quality, strengthened by the many handheld shots, links the film to the new waves of the 19 60s. Still, there are hints of the signature style to come. The average shot length (nineteen seconds), although much shorter than that o f any later Angelopoulos film, announces his reliance on staging within the frame. The interiors are thickly packed, with doorways providing pockets of space (Fig. 4.1). Stillness and silence play central roles; the murderous lovers stand panting over Kosta’s body for what seems a very long time. The camera dwells on landscapes, as a bus churns slowly through the mud or as the couple totter along a rainswept highway and trucks roar past them. The plot has time to linger on a quasi-abstract shot of men dotted around a field, urinating during a bus stopover (Fig. 4.2).</p>
        <p>The elliptical treatment of the murder in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> becomes a pervasive narrational strategy in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Days of 36</em>. A political prisoner takes a hostage, and eventually the police raid his cell. But these central events occur offscreen, hidden by stone walls and cunningly angled doorways, all the better to concentrate on the maneuverings of a corrupt regime. Once again individual motives are minimized, with most shots presenting groups of prisoners and officials. The film also pushes the long-take strategy much further (the ASL is seventy-two seconds), and long shots predominate so that the prison provides its own geometrical landscapes and spare choreography (Fig. 4.3).</p>
        <p>It is, however, with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> that the Angelopoulos look emerges most fully. In a typical scene the actors’ troupe walks from the beach and up a town street; after they have passed through the frame, the camera holds on the street, and the period shifts from November 1952 to winter of 1942 (Figs. 4.4-4.10). The distant framing, the lingering on an empty vista, and the flashback occurring within a single shot all became hallmarks of Angelopoulos’s style. With <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em>, which has an average shot length of ro5 seconds, Angelopoulos also confirmed his commitment to the very long take as his primary stylistic vehicle.</p>
        <p>Such shots rework familiar schemas in fresh ways . Nearly empty long shots had punctuated Antonioni’s 1960s films and Wim Wenders’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick</em> (1972), but Angelopoulos builds entire, slowly developing scenes around them. Flashbacks within a single shot were known in Hollywood (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Caravan</em>, 1937; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Enchantment</em>, 1948) and European cinema (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miss Julie</em>, 1951). Yet as Angelopoulos has pointed out, his originality lay in freeing such flashbacks from the recollections of a single character and expressing instead “<span>collective historical memory</span>” or even the echoes of past events lingering in the shot’s locale.<sup>23</sup> Likewise, in his reliance on the long take Angelopoulos proved a judicious adapter. Few directors had applied the technique to every scene, and none had applied it so single-mindedly to landscapes. The flagrantly prolonged shots in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> and his later films constitute his efforts to enrich a recognized, indeed canonized, tradition. The ostentatious style results in part from an artist’s coming belatedly to a game in which most of the moves have been made, and by very strong players.</p>
        <p>A European filmmaker starting out in the late 1960s confronted a rich array of stylistic options. One of the major choices was this: to utilize the long take or not ? “<span>The only great problem with cinema</span>”, Godard remarked, “<span>seems to me more and more with each film when and why to start a shot and when and why to end it</span>”.<sup>24</sup> Feuillade’s generation was not obliged to reflect on shot duration as an end in itself, and in the 1930s only a few directors , like Mizoguchi, seem to have grasped its possibilities . Simultaneous with the emergence of Bazin and mise-en-scene criticism, however, a great many directors were putting the long take on the agenda.</p>
        <p>The coming of sound encouraged filmmakers to lengthen their shots, and although this was done fairly unobtrusively in the 1930s, the problem of when to cut could not be ignored after Welles’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane</em> (1941), which highlighted several fixed takes running a minute or more. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s the long take, almost always in tandem with camera movement, became a salient stylistic option. In American studios, at a period when the average shot length per film was nine to eleven seconds, some directors favored very long takes: about sixteen seconds for Otto Preminger’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Angel Face</em> and George Cukor’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Marrying Kind</em> (both 1952), twenty-two seconds for Preminger’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fan</em> (1949) and Vincente Minnelli’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Band Wagon</em> (1952). The device was flaunted in the very lengthy sequence-shots in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lady in the Lake</em> (1946) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rope</em> (1948).</p>
        <p>Most filmmakers thought that Cinema Scope demanded long takes, so many widescreen films, especially musicals, were cut rather slowly; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oklahoma!</em> (1955), for example, has an ASL of nearly seventeen seconds. In postwar Eastern Europe as well the long take was alive and well, particularly because the Soviet cinema had developed a rather academic wide-angle style at about the same time Hollywood had (Fig. +n). In the late 1950s Panavision lenses eliminated the peculiar distortions of close views yielded by CinemaScope’s anamorphic process. American filmmakers could now return to the over-the-shoulder framings and strong singles of classical decoupage. A few directors-Preminger and Billy Wilder, then Roman Polanski and Mike Nichols-persisted in employing long takes, but by the 1970s it was a retrograde gesture. The accelerated cutting of the intensified continuity style had triumphed, and only “<span>off-Hollywood</span>” directors like Woody Allen and the younger independents would consistently rely on lengthy shots .</p>
        <p>In the hands of Hollywood directors the long take proved capable of great economy and unobtrusiveness, but it also suited the elliptical, suppressive narration of European modernist filmmaking. With causal connections often only hinted at, with character motivations kept mysterious, the gradually unfolding image gained extraordinary weight. The spectator had to search for relevant story information, register shifts in emotional tone, or spot moments that commented on characters’ relationships-individual versus group, interest versus detachment. Two influential stylists showed that the long take could sustain this oblique approach to storytelling.</p>
        <p>Carl Dreyer had been an editing-based director in his silent films; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Master of the House</em> (1925) is possibly the fastest- cut Danish film of the period,<sup>25</sup> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc</em> (1928), built almost completely out of suffocating close-ups, became a hallmark of montage-based silent cinema. Yet in his sound films Dreyer swung to the opposite extreme. From the 1940s he embraced an explicitly theatrical aesthetic: minimal figure movement, scanning or arcing tracking shots, and steadily lengthening takes: an ASL of fifteen seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Day of Wrath</em> (1943), seventeen seconds in Two People (1944), sixty-five seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ordet</em> (1955), ninety seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gertrud</em> (1964). The precision staging in the latter two works constitutes a retrospective revision of the schemas of the European cinema Dreyer entered in the 19ros (Fig. 4.12). His films were often denounced as boring, but his influence on younger filmmakers such as Angelopoulos was considerable.</p>
        <p>Other European directors put the long take on the creative agenda-Luchino Visconti and Max Ophuls come to mind-but particularly important for our purposes is Michelangelo Antonioni.<sup>26</sup> Antonioni’s 1950s films exemplify the richness of postwar mise- enscene. Fluid tracking shots pick up one character just as the one we’re following drops away, and other elements in the frame regroup themselves. Emphasis shifts easily between foreground and background, with only a nudge of the camera or a slightly turned player enough to create fresh compositions.<sup>27</sup> (See Figs. 4.13-4.14.) The AS Ls range from twenty-two seconds (the film noir <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cronaca di un amore</em> [a.k.a. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Story of a Love Affair</em>] , 1950; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Il Grido</em>, 1957) to a very unusual forty-three seconds (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Vinti</em>, 1953). In the string of more famous films beginning with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Avventura</em> (1960), Antonioni’s cutting pace picks up and his camera movements become less dazzling, but these works explore other options to which filmmakers also proved sensitive.</p>
        <p>The long take soon became central to the various Young Cinemas and new waves that emerged during the 1960s. Truffaut, Godard, Alexander Kluge, Jerzy Skolimowski, Ruy Guerra, and many other directors of the new generation flaunted long takes, often with generous camera movement. Significantly, however, virtually no directors adopted the long take as her or his stylistic signature in the manner of Dreyer or Antonioni. Most young filmmakers favored an “<span>assemblage</span>” aesthetic, whereby some sequences were handled in very long takes and other sequences were built out of dynamic cutting. Godard’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souffle</em> (1960) typifies this tendency, mixing prolonged camera movements with disjunctive montage. Oshima Nagisa took eclecticism to another level, building one film out of extraordinarily long takes (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Night and Fog in Japan</em>, 1960; ASL exceeds two minutes), and another out of very short shots (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Violence at Noon</em>, 1966; ASL 4.5 seconds). In an era of dawning film consciousness such pluralism implied that the filmmaker had mastered the entire history of cinematic technique, from Eisenstein to Ophuls. At the same time, certain technological factors that had encouraged long takes (sync-sound filming, heavy studio cameras) were largely gone, so long takes could be sensed as a deliberate effect. After the l 96os many “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">new cinemas</span>” would flaunt stylistic pluralism, the 1980s cinema du look of Leos Carax and Jean-Jacques Beineix no less than the New Hollywood of Spielberg and Scorsese.</p>
        <p>Still, the long take is a device capable of serving many different purposes. In Hollywood it was used chiefly for virtuosic following shots, as in today’s extended walk-andtalk sequences . By contrast, some postwar European filmmakers exploited it for the sake of what has come to be known as dedramatization. Between neorealism, with its gap filled narratives and unexpected longueurs, and the blank surfaces and diminuendo pacing of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Avventura</em>, filmic storytelling changed significantly. Dramas began excising “<span>melodrama</span>”, moving closer to the spacious rhythms of the modern novel. Emotions were underplayed, even suppressed. Real life, critics argued, did not parse itself into tight plots and smoothly ascending tension. Cinema could break free of Hollywood artifice by rendering in detail the anticlimaxes and wayward incidents of everyday life. Aided by an approach to storytelling that fostered uncertainty about character psychology and causal connections, dedramatization became one hallmark of ambitious filmmaking.</p>
        <p>Dedrarnatization took two principal forms. Instead of playing an emotionally charged situation for maximum expressiveness, the filmmaker could treat it in suppressive or oblique fashion. The paradigmatic example was Rossellini’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Italy</em> (1953). A marriage is fading, and during their stay in Italy the husband and wife agree to keep away from each other. She desperately tours the region while the husband seeks out romantic temptations. As he comes home after several nights away, Rossellini shows the wife lying on the sofa, listening intently to him undressing and gargling; either she is hoping to avoid a confrontation or hoping that he will come in to find her (Fig. 4.15). The resulting scene is no domestic quarrel; instead, it is merely a tissue of polite lies and half. formed accusations. Mizoguchi’s staging often conceals the emotions that burst out of his characters, but Rossellini keeps the emotions almost unexpressed. Voyage to Italy showed that a film could mute its action, even redefine what could count as action, by keying its tone to the couple’s boredom, enervation, and uneasiness-emotional states dissected in the European novel at least since Alberto Moravia’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Time of Indifference</em> (1929) and Sartre’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nausea</em> (1938) but seldom explored on film.</p>
        <p>Directors could dedramatize their plots in a second way: by including moments their predecessors would have trimmed as waste. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Italy</em>, almost in the manner of a travelogue, devotes long stretches to the wife’s ramblings around Naples and Pompeii. Filmmakers began wedging in temps morts, the “<span>dead time</span>” between dramatic arcs. In place of the compact dialogue of Hollywood, conversations were broken by prolonged pauses, often underscored by actors frozen in place. When characters did stir themselves, they often moved with a slowness reminiscent of the Sjostrom and Bauer classics of the l9IOS. The simple act of walking became prime cinematic material once more; filmmakers seemed to enjoy just trailing their characters. Bazin praised de Sica’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bicycle Thieves</em> (194 7) for playing down traditional plotting and patiently observing the two main characters’ gaits. “<span>It would be no exaggeration to say that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ladri di biciclette</em> is the story of a walk through Rome by a father and his son</span>”.<sup>28</sup></p>
        <p>The distant long take could support both suppressed emotion and temps morts. By not breaking the scene into close-ups, filmmakers could maintain a sense of muted drama. Subtle changes in framing could alert the spectator to the nuances that were replacing histrionics. And the sustained shot could force the viewer to concentrate on the empty intervals that filled so many scenes. Dreyer’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ordet</em> may have initiated this trend, but for most critics it was Antonioni who brought the novelistic, dedramatized, even antidramatic, cinema to maturity. It is hard for us today to realize how revolutionary a figure he seemed in the 1960s. For one French critic his work marked the third great epoch of film history; after thirty years of silent cinema and thirty years of sound film, we now had “<span>a cinema of behavior.<sup>29</sup> As another writer put it: ‘‘Antonioni’s people are not tidy, artificial, comfortably definite bundles of motives; they are always somewhat opaque, capable of surprises . As we are made to stare at them, and at the intervals of space and time which surround them, we must assess them as we assess people in our own lives</span>”.<sup>30</sup></p>
        <p>All of Antonioni’s early films narrow their emotional range, but from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Il Grido</em> to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Red Desert</em> (1964)-the films that made his international reputation-he goes farther than his contemporaries in draining the drama out of charged situations.<sup>31</sup> He virtually eliminates nondiegetic music, shot/reverse -shot cutting, and optical point of view. More and more he stages major actions in long shots, presenting figures in landscapes or spacious interiors.<sup>32</sup> In the beginning of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Il Grido</em>, for instance, Aldo returns to Irma after seven years, and Antonioni presents their reunion in a very uncommunicative image (Fig. 4.16). Perhaps the most famous of his distant shots is the forlorn ending of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Avventura</em>, which shrinks Sandro and Claudia to mere streaks in a blocked-out composition (Fig. 4.17).</p>
        <p>Antonioni likewise reduces scenes to silences and stretches of dead time in which nothing of traditional dramatic moment is occurring. “<span>I need to follow my characters beyond the moments conventionally considered important, to show them even when everything appears to have been said</span>”.<sup>33</sup> “<span>Antonioni is so elegant</span>”, remarks Jim Jarmusch, “<span>in the way he can let the scene go past its normal length, or the shot even, and the whole weight of the scene changes, the essence</span>”.<sup>34</sup> He renders acting more impassive by means of a fairly muted performance style, long-held poses, and a tendency to turn figures from the camera at moments of dramatic intensity, a “<span>dorsality</span>” reminiscent of Mizoguchi (Figs. 3.60, 3.63, and 4.16). The result is the “<span>inexpressive</span>” shot that actually expresses lassitude, anomie, suppressed pain, or emotional distances between the characters . The stasis of such scenes alternates with the dilatory walks that consume so much time in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Avventura, La Notte</em> (1961), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Eclisse</em> (1962), all films full of drift. With Antonioni, critics remarked, the talkies became the walkies.</p>
        <p>Antonioni wasn’t alone in exploring subdued emotion and empty intervals within the long shot. Jacques Tati’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vacances de M. Hulot</em> (1953), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mon Oncle</em> (1958), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Play Time</em> (1967) use temps marts to encourage the spectator to find humor by comparing different areas of the shot (Fig. 4.18). (Tati also pioneered the “<span>full-field</span>” schemas that would be so important for Otar Iosseliani and the 1970s minimalists like Akerman.) Nonetheless, it was Antonioni’s middle-period work that constituted the paradigm of “<span>dedramatized</span>” filmmaking for Angelopoulos’s generation. “<span>When I came to France</span>”, he recalled, “<span>it was the epoch of Antonioni, of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Avventura and La Notte</em>. When I was at IDHEC, you’d go every day to see a film by Antonioni</span>”.<sup>35</sup> What was so impressive? “<span>The considerable length of his shots, which went on just a little bit longer than expected to allow for a deep breath before going on</span>”.<sup>36</sup></p>
        <p>The difficulty for newcomers was that Antonioni had apparently pushed the dedramatized long take about as far as one could. He was, to borrow Harold Bloom’s phrase, a “<span>strong precursor</span>”, an innovator who intimidates his successors.<sup>37</sup> What could a young filmmaker add to a distinguished tradition that seemed to have already reached its peak ? One possibility was the poetic cinema that emerged in the USSR, most palpably in the work of Andrey Tarkovsky. Whereas Antonioni concentrated on urban anomie, Tarkovsky strove to capture the spiritual imprint of natural landscape on humans who could only partially apprehend it. He insisted that the film image should be neither obviously denotative, simply illustrating a story, nor portentously symbolic. He heaped scorn on all those schemas showing lovers split by fences and erring workers returning to the factory in triumphal long shots.<sup>38</sup> The film artist should seek out images that cannot be reduced to words or ideasimages that strike with the force of religious revelation. The long take proved crucial to this neosymbolist line of thought. Rejecting Eisenstein’s conception of montage, Tarkovsky joined Mizoguchi in holding that sound cinema had no need for decoupage that spelled everything out for the audience. Like Bazin, he believed that time is “<span>imprinted in the shots</span>”, so a film’s rhythm was determined “<span>by the pressure of the time that runs through them</span>”.<sup>39</sup></p>
        <p>Accordingly, Tarkovsky cultivated an atmospheric long-take style. Face-to-face encounters are filmed in protracted medium shot, but they are punctuated by hallucinatory vistas and still-life studies. Humans move through a space of primal starkness (Fig. 4 . 1 9 ). At the other end o f the visual scale the camera caresses quivering petals, murky streams, greasy puddles glistening on floorboards, or apples scattered across a tabletop, while breezes or rippling water or drifting snowflakes measure the time running through the shot. With the triumph of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Andrei Rublev</em> (1966) in European festivals, and the praise bestowed on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Solaris</em> (1972), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Mirror</em> (1974), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stalker</em> (1979), Tarkovsky became the emblem of a mystical, quietly ravishing cinema whose long takes invited the spectator to become absorbed in “<span>the concrete, living, emotional content of the object</span>”.<sup>40</sup></p>
        <p>Another route out of the Antonioni impasse emerged from the political debates of the 19 60s. Antonioni, like Balzac and Flaubert, had dissected bourgeois life from within, but many believed that this was not enough. Directors all over the world sought ways to put postwar modernist experimentation at the service of more radical political critique. Some filmmakers looked to 1920s Soviet filmmaking, but they filtered the montage aesthetic through the revival of disjunctive editing in the work of the Nouvelle Vague and Brazil’s Cinema Novo. The result was a mordant cinema of collage seen in Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hour of the Furnaces</em> (1968) and Dusan Makavejev’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">WR: Mysteries of the Organism</em> (1971).</p>
        <p>Other politicized modernists turned to the “<span>dedramatization</span>” tradition. Most prominent among them was the Hungarian Miklos Jancs6, already strongly influenced by Antonioni in Cantata (1963). Turning from Antonioni’s enervated couples, however, Jancso revamped the 1920s Soviet conception of a group protagonist. Thus <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Round-Up</em> (1965), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Silence and Cry</em> (1966), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Red and the White</em> (1967) concentrate on specific moments of historical change but play down heroes and concentrate on large-scale forces and moment-by-moment fluctuations in power. The situations are intrinsically charged with dramatic voltage-guards confronting prisoners, commanders randomly pulling captives for execution—but Jancso short-circuits the emotional effect. Exposition is sketchy; secondary characters aren’t individuated (a device Angelopoulos would draw on), and central players sometimes don’t get characterized until moments before they die. The walkies are here with a vengeance. Instead of dialogue we get men and women pacing, strutting, marching, trotting, and dancing, often supplying few hints about their motives or destinations. Jancso forgoes nondiegetic music and employs a camera more concerned with group dynamics than individual destiny, casually picking up and dropping figures in the course of a shot. Scenes are played out in very long takes; some of Jancso’s shots run nine minutes or more, consuming an entire camera reel, and some of the films consist of a mere ten shots.</p>
        <p>In the late 1960s Jancso gave up the pretext of presenting a concrete dramatic situation, pushing toward ensemble numbers that put abstract conflicts of ideology on display. Now he aims at an all-engulfing choreography of figures, landscape, and camera. The scene teems with people, usually young and often naked. They move swiftly, in circular and serpentine patterns, while horsemen circle, musicians wind through the crowd, and banners flutter past us. Color, used symbolically to sharpen political oppositions, stands out against the neutral landscape. All the while, the camera tracks, cranes, zooms, and racks focus to create a floating, plastic, constantly shrinking and swelling space. Oxymoronic as it sounds, Jancso’s version of dedramatization is florid, even “<span>maximalist</span>”, as became evident with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Red Psalm</em> (1972) and the films that followed. The contending groups have become pure emblems of social forces, playing out rituals on the bare arena of the Hungarian plainscinematic pageantry enacting a neo-Marxist reading of history (Fig. 4.20).<sup>41</sup></p>
        <p>Although Jancs6 avoids traditional dramatic appeals like psychologized protagonists, he offers a robust kinetic spectacle in their place. Other political modernists pursued a more austere approach. Inspired by one conception of Brecht’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Verfremdungseffekt</em> (estrangement effect), some took dedramatization toward simplification and severity. JeanMarie Straub and Daniele Huillet explored the long-shot technique not only in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach</em> (1967), whose pseudo-Baroque tableaus keep the camera at a considerable distance from the drama (Fig. 4.21), but also in a series of landscape films that included <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fortini/Cani</em> (1977). Perhaps the limit of this minimalist tendency is Godard’s “<span>blackboard films</span>” such as Vent d’est (1969), but it emerges in less forbidding form as well. One example is Chantal Akerman’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jeanne Dielmann 23 Quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles</em> (1975 ). In its tracing of a few days in the life of a housewife who works prostitution into her daily schedule, the film dwells on mundane activities and temps marts. Through rigorous uses of perpendicular framing and 90- degree and 180-degree cuts, Akerman gives Jeanne’s routines a sober pictorial abstraction (Fig. 4.22).</p>
        <p>Even directors not inclined toward politicized modernism opted for long takes that presented a dry, detached pictorial design. For example, during the 1970s many directors began to present action in fairly fixed camera positions from a great distance, without cutting in to nearer and clearer views. The tendency was most evident in the avant-garde, such as James Benning’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">11 x 14</em> (1976) and Klaus Wyborny’s “<span>neoprimitivist</span>” works (Fig. 4.23 ). Marguerite Duras’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">India Song</em> (1975) played out highly melodramatic scenes in distant, oblique interiors accompanied by languorous offscreen tango tunes ( Fig. 4.24).</p>
        <p>All these avenues for exploiting the long take-lyrical spirituality, colorful spectacle, minimalism-were open to Angelopoulos when he began his career. But there was also a problem. So many people were embracing the long-take technique that originality was hard to come by, and sheer repetition could sooner or later register as mannerism. Angelopoulos became, like most of his contemporaries, a synthesizer who developed a distinctive style by mixing and revising available schemas. He was attracted to the austere variant of political modernism, and his earliest works explored its resources. In the second phase of his career (often with the aid of Antonioni’s scriptwriter, Tonino Guerra), he created ambivalent psychological dramas situated within concrete political and geographical milieus. Within each stage he preserved Antonioni’s dedramatizing tactics but adapted them to spectacular panoramas . What Antonioni had occasionally done with landscapes, Angelopoulos did consistently and at length. Further, he countered the impersonality and coldness of minimalists like Straub/Huillet and Akerman by evoking feelings suitable to grim weather, forbidding topography, and the demeanor of the human body in a monumental space. His images’ characteristic emotional tone-bleakness, futility, melancholy-took some of the stringency out of political modernism. Unlike Tarkovsky, he would not let the camera hover over textures and teasing details. Unlike Jancso, he would not maintain a restless, headlong rhythm; he would slow the action down, as he puts it, to the tempo of steady breathing.<sup>42</sup> True, by playing out his dramas in vast landscapes he recalled Jancs6, but instead of the exuberant rolling expanse of the Hungarian plains, Angelopoulos offered rocky mountainsides and overcast seascapes: landscapes that exuded mournfulness. In sum, he sustained the European modernist tradition not only through time -shifting narration and allegorical tales of History but also through an aesthetic of austere spectacle. By finding a way to innovate within a competitive tradition, he revived and revised staging techniques developed in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
        <p>Angelopoulos’s gamble succeeded; he became the foremost long-take director of his time. The technique became the basis of his style in his tetralogy, extending the shot from an average of 72 seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Days of 36</em> and 105 seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> to 206 seconds in The Hunters, then stepping back down to 107 seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander the Great</em>. In the first trilogy of his “<span>humanist</span>” phase he cut back, as if shorter shots were better suited to rendering more personalized psychology: 6 6 seconds average shot length in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em>, 78 seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beekeeper</em>, and 82 seconds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em>. Then his shot lengths started to rise again: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Suspended Step of the Stork</em> averages l16 seconds, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em> 103 seconds , and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eternity and a Day</em> 121 seconds. Despite these fluctuations, every film remains extraordinary in its avoidance of editing. In a period when a two-hour commercial film would contain between 900 and l,800 shots, all of Angelopoulos’ films contained fewer than 150, and most fewer than 100. Some of those shots run a full camera reel. As with Antonioni and Jancs6, awareness of the apparently endless length of the take becomes an ingredient of the viewer’s experience.</p>
        <p>Just as pronounced was Angelopoulos’s preference for very distant shots. Some longtake films keep the camera close to the figures (e.g., Fellini’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">8 1/2</em>, Alexei Guerman’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Khroustaliev, My Car!</em>), but Angelopoulos favors the long-shot and extreme-long-shot range. He doesn’t avoid medium shots entirely, but usually they are incorporated into much wider views. Even in interiors his camera assumes a considerable distance from the action, and outdoors it can reduce the humans to mere dots. He relies, with a somewhat anachronistic idealism, on the powers of cinema to present fine detail within a large-scale image. Angelopoulos’s films depend so crucially on fine-grained photographic rendition of immense spaces that much of their impact is lost on a television monitor, where a character may be only a clump of pixels. He is one of the last directors to design his images specifically for the theater screen.</p>
        <p>Long takes, long shots: the consistency is remarkable, but recognizing these factors constitutes only a first step toward understanding Angelopoulos’s style. How does he use the long take to achieve his characteristic effects ? What functions are performed by the distant framings ? And how do these stylistic patterns revise norms of staging circulating at his moment ?</p>
        <p>Most generally, Angelopoulos gains what other filmmakers in this tradition gain: the simultaneous presence of many elements in the visual field, soliciting the viewer to search out revealing aspects; the gradation of emphasis that activates secondary elements with special vividness; the sustaining of rhythm through the movement and stillness of figures and their coordination with the moving camera. Yet no deep-space directors before the 1960s relied so completely on the long shot and the extreme long shot. Like Braque carrying Cubism beyond Picasso, like Hindemith taking neoclassicism past Stravinsky, Angelopoulos pursues the dramatic and expressive possibilities opened up by Antonioni’s dedramatized compositions but within a consistently distant view. Still, he must also tell his story, and the continuous long shot poses problems on this front. Angelopoulos must now make the shot’s narrative development legible-if not as evident as in other stylistic traditions, at least minimally apparent. As with Feuillade and Mizoguchi, we can thus ask: How is attention guided and maintained within these images? Angelopoulos employs several staging strategies, some of which we have seen operating since the 1910s, others of more recent vintage.</p>
        <p>Most obvious is centering. A style based in tight framings, such as Hollywood’s intensified continuity, will tend to keep the center of the widescreen frame vacant, using cutting to balance slightly off-center close shots against one another (Figs. 1.47-1.50). But in a long-shot, long-take aesthetic the central zone becomes an important guide to what is salient. The more distant the shot, even if it is comparatively empty, the more likely that key dramatic information will rest in or pass through the geometrical center of the picture format. This principle holds good in many Angelopoulos scenes already mentioned (for example, Figs. 4.1, 4.3, 4.5). So does the corollary strategy of two rival centers of interest operating in tension across the middle of the frame (Fig. 4.2).</p>
        <p>Like other directors in the mise-en-scene tradition, Angelopoulos uses aperture framing to guide our attention. Rectangular shapes in the set highlight certain elements. When Alexander and Youla greet their father in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em>, a “<span>good Gestalt</span>” of the three figures is created by means of centering, a sparsely furnished frame, the father’s frontality, and the sheltering box of the station doorway (Fig. 4.25). Later in the film a more dense shot of policemen and townsmen gathered in a cafe is made comprehensible through several lines and grids. As two policemen, near frame center, explain the deportation of Spyros, the key action is framed by the windowpane, and a nearly right-angled stovepipe segregates a secondary batch of listeners (Fig. 4.26).</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander the Great</em> boldly exploits aperture framing, fo r the camera i s often very far away from the action. As the British tourists climb to the Temple of Poseidon, from which they will be kidnapped by Alexander’s gang, the camera tilts up with them, framing the temple from afar (Fig. 4.27). Their guide explains that the Greeks have lost faith in their gods. One tourist walks to the top, apparently overcome by the aura of antiquity, and says, “<span>Shh!</span>” while putting his finger to his lips (Fig. 4.28). Remarkably, this gesture is discernible in our postcard view; Angelopoulos has turned the other tourists from us, raised the speaker above the others, silhouetted him against the sky, and framed his gesture in a slot formed by the columns. Just as audacious is the scene of Alexander’s bringing his captives to the Communist village he dominates. Gathered in the town square the villagers quarrel about how to deal with him, but then Alexander’s men become visible between highly placed branches in the frame (Plate 4.2). We are cued by the sudden silence of the communards, the fact that they all turn from us to look at the horizon, their stillness when they see the band, the presence of movement at the top of the frame, and the patches of bright colors visible on the kidnapped lords. Slowly the bandits come forward (Plate 4.3), clear a space among the crowd, and put the captives at frame center-a triumphal moment whose majesty is undercut by the opaque means of rendering it (Plate 4-4). For Feuillade and his peers aperture framing was swift and unforced, its artificiality often unnoticed by the viewer. Here, as with Mizoguchi, it is a self.conscious aesthetic effect: we are aware of straining to see bits of action within crannies of the setting.</p>
        <p>In Mizoguchi that straining is often rewarded with narratively important information, however diminished and fine-grained it may be. But in Angelopoulos the momentum of storytelling is invariably dissipated by dedramatization, and the positions of the English tourists and the villagers in these examples illustrate one distinctive staging tactic in his repertoire. His people turn away from us, and in an unusual way. Since the late 1910s, mainstream cinema has characteristically positioned characters at a three-quarter frontal angle. (Interestingly, some psychologists have suggested that this is the most informative posture for recognizing faces and registering eye movements).<sup>43</sup> In his 1950s and early 1960s work Antonioni replaced the angled frontal view with an exactly opposite one, framing characters turned diagonally away from us. In our earlier shot from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Il Grido</em> the dialogue is played with characters’ backs to us in two three-quarter views (Fig. 4.16). The effect is that of an incomplete shot/reverse-shot sequence, withholding the shot that would show the characters frontally. This “<span>three-quarter dorsality</span>” minimizes our access to character reaction-sometimes offering only a bit of cheek or jaw to watch, often obliging us to read reactions solely from stance and posture.</p>
        <p>Tarkovsky occasionally employs such uncommunicative views , but they are building blocks of staging for Angelopoulos, who insists on holding them quite a while. In the famous shot from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> several men dotted around a drab gray field relieve themselves in variants of the three-quarter pose (Fig. 4.2), and in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beekeeper</em> the hitchhiking girl dances to the jukebox in the roadside cafe (Fig. 4.29). In exteriors camera movement often works to preserve the three- quarter rear view. Alexander trails the bridal procession in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eternity and a Day</em> from a distance, the camera angled to keep everyone in extreme long shot and turned from us (Fig. 4.30). Angelopoulos’s scenic curve often displays a gradual development toward three-quarter dorsality. Accordingly, frontal or profiled positions of the figures often serve as mere transitions to the three-quarter resting point (Figs. 4.31-4.32). In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em> Spyros has returned to his village and meets his old neighbor on the street, first in a marked three-quarter rear view (Fig. 4.33). After they share cigarettes and reflect on their departed comrades (“<span>We were all finished in the civil war . . . . Everyone lost</span>”), the neighbor says he has no reason to stay in the village, and the scene concludes with a rhythmic alternation of dorsal views (Figs. 4.34-4.35).</p>
        <p>The three- quarter rear view, apart from forcing us to infer characters’ facial reactions, also helps solve the problem of legibility in the landscape shots. The posture allows Angelopoulos to mark out human presence but also to coax our eye back to the surroundings. Instead of faces, which attract our notice even in very distant images, we get backs and shoulders-uninformative aspects that can’t hold us long. We are obliged to study the body or, more accurately, study the body’s relation to the larger field into which it’s inserted. As with Mizoguchi’s distant depths and dorsal views, the three-quarter views in Angelopoulos encourage us to pass from figure to environment.</p>
        <p>So does the sheer paucity of what is present. The Angelopoulos long shot tends to be sparse. The frame is not literally empty-some human figures are usually visible-but only a few sectors of space are activated, the rest being neutralized or serving to frame the action. Thanks to the diminutive scale, the comparative absence of figure movement (the characters walk slowly or stand in place), and a lack of information about the characters (reduced in size, seen from the rear, often in three-quarter view), the image goes very still. It becomes a dead space that invites the viewer to linger over previous developments, to wait for something new to modify the stasis, or to simply contemplate vacancy.</p>
        <p>Antonioni had suggested the possibilities of such compositions (Fig. 4.36), but Angelopoulos carried the idea much further. Reconstruction makes eloquent use of the vacant shot (Fig. 4.2), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> is filled with such images, most notably the bookend shots of the troupe’s arrival at the film’s beginning and end (Figs . 4.37-4.38). In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beekeeper</em> the empty shot is often used to present Alexander tending his hives (Fig. 4.39). A more stripped-down version occurs in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em>, when the two runaway children part from Orestes on the motorway (Fig. 4.40).</p>
        <p>The sparseness of the frame affects the pacing of the long shot. If the viewer is fully to take in such distant images, they must be held on the screen for some time. Yet by refusing to pack them with movement, Angelopoulos brakes the dramatic rhythm. Searching for gestures and telltale alignments of figures, the viewer must test a variety of ways to fill such hollow shots with meaning. The result, beyond the self-conscious pictorialism, is a suspension of dramatic progression that allows both detached contemplation and a sense of dry, understated emotion. In a distant shot communards under Alexander the Great’s command surrender their weapons. We have no access to their facial expressions, but we can read their defeat from their weary loping to obey his order (Fig. 4.41).</p>
        <p>Tactics of centering and aperture framing highlight the (already attenuated) story action while three-quarter dorsality and spare settings deflect us from it. Angelopoulos does not, however, stop with this dynamic. He goes on to “<span>preform</span>” his figures, interiors, and landscapes by means of a consistent set of dedramatized staging options. Here again we can see his synthesizing role. None of these schemas is unique to him, but he concentrates so single-mindedly on them and explores them so imaginatively that they have come to form his signature, stamping every film as “<span>by Angelopoulos</span>”. They give each film a theme -and-variations structure; one image will come to be seen as a return to or deviation from another image shown earlier in the film or seen elsewhere in the oeuvre. And these types of images can be combined, within a single sequence or even within a single shot, to maximize their visual and dramatic possibilities. Angelopoulos revises and explores the resources of two predominant image schemas. (See box.)</p>
        <p>Distanced recessiveness, emerging in Europe during the 1950s, continued to be a salient option throughout the 1970s, and Angelopoulos seized on it as a central staging tactic. He was able to fine -tune it by combining it with the empty frame, three-quarter dorsality, and strongly perspectival settings. When he organizes a recessive shot around central perspective, as in interiors or on city streets or roadways, the vanishing point can pull our attention to important action. The rape of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voula in Landscape in the Mist</em> becomes all the more shocking because the diagonal plunge of the truck and roadway keeps forcing our eye back to the truck driver’s pursuit (Fig. 4.50). But central perspective is seldom this deterministic in Angelopoulos. He often creates a tension between a central vanishing point and a foreground, off-center figure. This effect is marked in the declamations of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> (Fig. 4.51), as well as in the handling of the border station in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Suspended Step of the Stork</em> (Fig. 4.52).</p>
        <p>Typically, the perspective is not so neatly centered. The endless corridors of the prison in Days of ‘.3 6 and of the hotel in The Hunters remind us that Angelopoulos can evoke a more oblique sort of depth. He uses recessional perspective to diminish our view of salient information, further dedramatizing the scene and obliging us to concentrate on very distant clues to the plot’s progress. The spectator must strain to follow the tiniest wrinkles in the action.</p>
        <p>A bold example occurs in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunters</em>. Yorgos is sitting in a tavern, his back to us, and two burly men come to sit before him in the foreground (Fig. 4.53). One complains that the leftists are planning a coup. Angry, Yorgos rises and starts to sing a left-wing protest song as he threads his way into the distance (Fig. 4.54). The camera arcs left, keeping him more or less centered as he uncertainly finishes the song, his back still to us, caught in a slim aperture (Fig. 4.55). If the scene had been shot from the opposite angle, Yorgos would advance to the camera, and this, along with his defiant singing, could make him heroic. Here, his shrinking to a tiny silhouette and the weakening of his voice undercut his commitment, foreshadowing his eventual capitulation to the right-wing forces. Pictorially, the composition engages the viewer in a steadily intensifying act of visual concentration on a man who will become little more than a speck.</p>
        <p>Here the lighting and central placement highlight Yorgos, but Angelopoulos also uses architecture to shape the frame space. Recessive diagonals can slice a locale into sharply separated zones. Antonioni explored this option occasionally, but from the earliest scenes of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> Angelopoulos made it central to his handling of “<span>empty</span>” shots (Fig. 4.56). Assigning cells of space to characters is easily thematized as expressing division and incommunicability, but I think that the perceptual dynamics of such shots are more important, especially in the context of Angelopoulos’s distant framings. If foreground areas can be kept relatively bare, stretching to the middle ground, then far-off gates, doors, or street corners can mark distant incidents as important (Fig. 4.57).</p>
        <p>Within interiors Angelopoulos frequently creates recessive perspectives around door-ways. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reconstruction</em> a recurring use of the household’s doorway measures the progress of the action (Figs. 4.r, 4.58, 4.59). And <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Days of 36</em> treats certain scenes as permutations of recessional views through apertures. The authorities constantly return to the cell in which Sofianos holds Kriezis hostage, allowing us the narrowest sliver of access (Figs. 4.60-4.62). This obliqueness is motivated as well by the consistently external standpoint the narration presents; we are always attached to the authorities outside the cell and are never allowed to go inside with the prisoner and his hostage. Spatial obliquity becomes narrational opacity.</p>
        <p>The zigzag scanning demanded by such recessional shots recalls the wide-angle depth associated with 1940s trends, but Angelopoulos, starting his career aftet Antonioni, Jancso, and others had developed a more distanced recessiveness, knows the advantages of setting the nearest plane some distance from us. In modern European cinema the empty foreground often signals an aesthetic distance between the viewer and the characters’ situations. At first glance this strategy of medium-shot depth would seem to recall the schemas employed by Feuillade and his contemporaries, but it actually inverts the dramatic scale of values implicit in their shots. In the 1910s the rising action of a scene pulled the actors toward the camera, with greater drama occurring in the closest planes. Angelopoulos, in flagrant defiance of audience empathy, often makes his characters retreat from us, as when Yorgos leaves the table (Figs. 4.53-4.55), and the scene’s climax may be played out at the points farthest from the foreground.</p>
        <p>The distanced, recessive frame is central to Angelopoulos’s mise-en-scene from the start, but after <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Days of 36</em> the planimetric composition starts to develop as an alternative. Throughout <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> characters are ranged in friezelike compositions, either within the theater (Fig. 4.63) or within landscapes (Fig. 4.64). Several critics have pointed out that this device turns many locales into Brechtian tableaux, paralleling historical events with the performance of the players,<sup>46</sup> but we should also note that Angelopoulos is adapting a compositional schema that was already circulating in his milieu (see box). His subsequent films employ the planimetric image to combine both frontal and profile views or to create muted moments through dorsality. He striates landscapes by spreading ribbons of figures parallel to the horizon, as in the breathtaking wedding ceremony at the riverside in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Suspended Step of the Stork</em> (Figs. 4.65-4.67). In addition, the “<span>clothesline</span>” effect of the planimetric image seems to encourage his camera to pan or track in order to explore all those parallel vectors running through the shot. And apertures play no less important a role in the planimetric image than in the recessive one. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em>, when Youla stands at the station doorway and speaks of darkness and light, railway track workers riding on their handcar are first seen as spectral blobs of yellow in the right window pane before they coast past the doorway (Plates 4.5-4.6).</p>
        <p>From first to last, the planimetric imagery of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eternity and a Day</em> slips toward pictorial abstraction, perhaps evoking the dying poet’s yearning for a spiritual “<span>beyond</span>” in memory or in death. The opening, with the boy Alexander called outside, follows him from his room to a staircase; the camera lingers on a tall window (Fig. 4.68). Via a cut, the window frame gives way to another straight-on rectangle, the silhouette of the family’s beach pavilion as the boy rushes in from the front (Fig. 4.69). As he is joined by friends, they race to the surf, the camera tracking forward and zooming in to create a planimetric image (Fig. 4.70). Over the film, Angelopoulos turns streets, a construction site, even a massive ship into planimetric surfaces. Within a single shot, a quasi-documentary image of Alexander walking along the harbor (Fig. 4.71) becomes planimetric as he passes (Fig. 4.72) and turns into pure abstraction (Fig. 4.73 ). Again and again, through Alexander’s memories we return to the villa and beach of his childhood and marriage (Figs. 4.74-4.75), before the film’s final shot pins him to the horizon (Fig. 4.76).</p>
        <p>Although the recessional image and the planimetric one may seem to be rivals, Angelopoulos exploits both. In his work they form a pair of schemas that can be revised from film to film. We instantly recognize the Angelopoulos cafe (recessional, with oblique depth), the Angelopoulos roadside (recessional, often with central perspective), the Angelopoulos beach or riverside ( planimetric, with clotheslined figures), and so on. Further, a particular image may combine the two options through camera movement or staging (Figs. 4.77-4.78). The stunning finale of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Suspended Step</em> shows the reporter starting off along the river as the linemen ascend the poles (Fig. 4.79). But then the camera arcs rightward to create a monumentally planimetric tableau as the reporter pauses at the river and the men pull the lines taut (Fig. 4.80). A sharp diagonal has become a laminated landscape.</p>
        <p>With some sense of Angelopoulos’s salient principles of visual design we can reevaluate our first impressions about his technique. The long take can now be seen as creating, sustaining, or blending empty shots and three-quarter views, recessional and planimetric compositions. Even when the long take does not merge two time periods within the shot, as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunters</em>, it also serves to confine us to certain sorts of images; very soon we learn that we will not get cut-in close -ups or shot/reverse shots ; we must work with the comparatively distant view. Similarly, the temps marts compel us to concentrate on the gradual changes that constitute the action.</p>
        <p>Yet the very scale of what counts as action in these frames poses a problem. The shots help tell the story but so slowly and sparsely that they outrun standard conceptions of narrative economy. Our next impulse is to interpret them, but that path is usually no more rewarding, since the flagrant lack of narrative economy in the images is matched by a lack of symbolic richness as well. (Hence the objection voiced by one nonadmirer: “<span>O.K. , we got it, Theo, now turn it off!</span>”)<sup>47</sup> The protracted image outruns its denotative and symbolic aspects, striving instead for both emotional expressivity and formal abstraction.</p>
        <p>On one hand this is “<span>mood cinema</span>”, like mood music: the story is amplified not only through the threnodic score but also through the skies, the landscapes, and the bearing of the humans dotted around the frame. On the other hand the fastidious compositions and stringent vectors of movement ask to be apprehended as monumental pattern. Lenin’s head, lashed to the barge drifting down the Danube (Plate 4.1), passing people kneeling and crossing themselves on shore, soon stops being a symbol of the death of Communism and forms an occasion for grave emotion, mixing sorrow and a guarded exhilaration. The throb of the barge’s engine is overwhelmed by Eleni Karaindrou’s briskly pulsating score, setting a mournful viola and other solo instruments against massed and rising strings. The alternating shots of the barge and the watchers on shore are cut in time to the variations worked on the brightening, dancelike melody, as if this were a weirdly spare music video.<sup>48</sup> After nearly three and a half minutes the statue has become a massive chunk of the landscape, a drifting iceberg counterpointed to the enthralled people on the bank, themselves turned into a stream of planimetric bands . Mizoguchi’s films kept narrative denotation, expressivity, symbolic meaning, and pictorial abstraction in balance, but Angelopoulos has reshifted the image’s weight. He sacrifices storytelling and moves beyond symbolic purport in order to conjure up a bleakly expressive cinema that also lays claim to overpowering beauty.</p>
        <p>The commitment to long takes, distant views, sparse frames, and temps morts stakes everything on the unfolding image. Since cuts are unlikely to come, we must wait for the shot to reveal its mysteries at its own pace. The slackened rhythm allows us to form rather explicit expectations about how the staging will develop. Feuillade and his contemporaries had no time for such niceties; they left such expectations tacit, exploiting them for the sake of fluid visual narration. Mizoguchi balanced compelling plot situations with shots that might tease us with fastidious changes in design. Angelopoulos is yet more overt, announcing himself as an impresario of vision. He will show us everything, but in good time, and at a tempo that drains normal dramatic momentum out of the scene. The shot will pursue its own spatial trajectory. During the final battle for the village in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander the Great</em>, Alexander’s son is struck by a bullet as he runs for cover; he is rescued by a housewife (Figs. 4.81-4.87). His pain and her panic are played out far from the camera, and his escape is further dedramatized by taking place in the most distant reaches of the shot. Here the spatial arc does not match the dramatic one: each rising phase of the action takes place farther and farther away.</p>
        <p>Endowing the long take with its own spatial structure often leads Angelopoulos to build the shot toward a purely pictorial climax. That may be a sublime landscape or a grand enigmatic emblem, like the gigantic stone hand lifted mysteriously from the bay in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em> (Fig. 4.88). Or the climax may be a leap into pure abstraction, as we have already seen in the movement toward planimetric imagery in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eternity and a Day</em>. Sometimes the pictorial epiphany will come at the end of the shot, sometimes at a point that permits a diminuendo into something more prosaic. In any case the visual climax may reinforce a dramatic climax, or even create one.</p>
        <p>Camera movement, present in almost every long take that Angelopoulos makes, provides help in creating pictorial epiphanies. Usually the camera follows characters in motion, sometimes picking up one while dropping another. This tactic allows Angelopoulos to keep the shot alive, to sustain visual interest while also linking or developing his characteristic compositions, as in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Suspended Step</em> instances already mentioned (Figs. 4.33-4.35, 4.79-4.80). But his most common camera movement derives from a very old schema that he has revised for his own purposes. Recall the scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> discussed at the outset of this chapter. The troupe walks to town from the waterfront, moving diagonally toward us, the camera tracking to keep them at a three- quarter angle (Fig. 4.4). Then the camera slows to let them pass rightward, panning to keep them in profile (Fig. 4.5). The camera slows still more, and the actors walk diagonally into the distance, turned from us in a three- quarter view complementary to that seen at the start of the shot. Some earlier filmmakers used this angular pickup/profiled passing/angular walkaway pattern, most commonly in scenes shot on location (for example, Mizoguchi’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters of the Gion</em>, 1936), although closer versions are feasible in large sets (for example, Renoir’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rules of the Game</em>, 1939).<sup>49</sup> This schema is often seen in postwar neorealist movies and in Hollywood films shot on location. (Preminger is especially fond of it in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Exodus</em>, 1960, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Advise and Consent</em>, 1962).</p>
        <p>This come-and-go pattern allows Angelopoulos to structure his scenes around a visual arc that may or may not synchronize with the conventional dramatic one. The simplest possibility is to use the diagonal-approach phase of the shot to establish the main players in the scene and to save the visual revelation for the field revealed at the end of the panning movement. This is more or less what happens in the boy’s wounding in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander the Great</em> (Figs. 4.81-4.87) and the time-shifting stroll in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em> (Figs. 4.4-4.10). The diagonal approach/diagonal withdrawal schema can also generate a certain suspense: we see characters who are looking at something offscreen, and the camera pans with them as they move toward something revelatory, a visual/dramatic climax.</p>
        <p>A good example occurs in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em>, when the protagonist, A, follows a woman down a street (Fig. 4.89). The camera pans to let the two pass then picks them up on the opposite diagonal, now revealing a vast crowd bearing candles (Fig. 4.90). Here, as so often, the last phase of the shot shows space on a grand scale. The climax is more visual than dramatic, or, rather, by being a visual climax it can create a dramatic one, even though we may be uncertain about exactly what plot action is taking place. In this shot from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em> Angelopoulos piles on the complications, with police pouring into the midground as the camera cranes up (Fig. 4.91) and then a crowd of umbrellas pressing into the foreground (Fig. 4.92). After everything freezes into a tableau, the crowd rushes the police. The shot ends at the height of visual and dramatic intensity.</p>
        <p>So the final phase of the diagonal approach/profiled pan/diagonal retreat schema can provide a crescendo when something massive is revealed. Just as often, though, Angelopoulos reserves the depths of the shot for developments on a somewhat smaller scale. Take the scene in Voyage to Cythera in which Katerina offers to coax the recalcitrant Spyros out of their home. The sequence starts with her, their son Alexander, and the town officials approaching the cottage (Fig. 4.93). She passes fairly near the camera, but the closest moment of facial expression in the scene is presented not as the climax but as preparation for it (Fig. 4.94), leading from a three- quarter dorsal view (Fig. 4.95) to her arrival at the door of the cottage, to meet Spyros (Fig. 4.96). ‘‘Always the same</span>”, says Katerina. “<span>When you’re afraid, you hide</span>”. After another moment they embrace. At this great distance from the camera, seen through the spindly gate work, Spyros accepts leaving his home for permanent exile. Whereas the 1910s director would stage this climax in the closest plane, Angelopoulos pushes the actors very far back, throwing dramatic structure out of gear with spatial patterning. The shot, however, is not over. Turning, the old couple return to the gate to stare at the men offscreen (Fig. 4.97). After Spyros says , “<span>Withered apple</span>” (a phrase he uses to evoke both his lost lands and his relation to Katerina), the twominute shot ends. This is another way to round off the action-bringing figures back to the middle ground as a diminuendo.</p>
        <p>In shots such as this, character movement and camera movement participate in a larger dynamic of opening and filling space at a tempo that allows us to anticipate how the blocking will develop. Thanks to the long take, the muted action, and dead intervals, Angelopoulos prolongs the process of staging, leaving us plenty of time to recognize that we are forming expectations about where the character or camera will go next. In this respect Angelopoulos slows down 1950s Antonioni.</p>
        <p>Since the early years of cinema, one prominent staging schema has relied on filling in the blanks . As we’ve seen in both Feuillade and Mizoguchi, the director may leave a vacant spot in the frame and then bring an actor into it, calling attention to the new figure while also completing the composition. Angelopoulos lays this technique bare by overtly creating gaps that he will then slowly fill, delaying the moment when the shot clicks into place. In a cafe scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Suspended Step</em> the reporter meets the young bride. The camera follows him striding toward her through the crowd (Fig. 4.98), but suddenly (and implausibly) a wide stretch of the dance floor opens to allow us an unimpeded view of her in the background (Fig. 4.99). We are given several moments to speculate on who will move next, but then the camera edges slightly leftward, clearing still more room for the couple; eventually the bride rises and comes to the dead center of the frame (Fig. 4.100).</p>
        <p>Even without camera movement, simply filling a gap can develop and climax the long take. We’ve already seen this happen in the blank foregrounds of the street in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses Gaze</em>, filled first by police and then, more surprisingly, by the ranks of umbrellas (Figs . 4.90-4.92). In one episode of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunters</em> the police fan out across a street but charitably leave a slot that will serve as a window through which we can watch the approach of the peace demonstrators (Fig. 4.101), the arrival of the car that will snatch Yannis (Fig. 4.102), and then the aftermath of the clash, with the police dispersing and the dead victim lying in the street at the center of the shot’s perspective (Fig. 4.103). It is as if the entire arc of the action were known in advance. Watch this space, the shot implies from the outset, and eventually you will be rewarded.</p>
        <p>We study the distant view, we probe those figures turned from us, we scan the horizontal stretch or wait for action at a vanishing point, we form expectations about the trajectory of the camera or the characters . Our patience is often rewarded at the end of a shot. The visual climax may be somewhat striking, as in this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hunters</em> scene; it may be nothing short of stunning, as in linemen stretched out like notes on a staff (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Suspended Step</em>, Fig. 4.80) or a gigantic hand rising from the bay to float over the city (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em>, Fig. 4.88). It may also be quite muted, as when men in yellow slickers slide ghostlike through the rain, or when the boy leaving Alexander’s car for an uncertain future rushes past the taillights and his face turns brilliant red for an instant (Plates 4.7-4.8). In all cases the strategy of building a long take to a moment of heightened pictorial expressivity, in the context of a drama that muffles the sort of emotional investment solicited by mainstream storytelling, has its source in a modernist aesthetic. Angelopoulos has blended salient techniques of two traditions of European cinema-Antonioni’s dedramatization and austere political modernism-in order to sustain a refined awareness of the very act of apprehending the scene, an experience crucial to the tradition of cinematic modernism.</p>
        <p>His shots, then, curiously halt the forward time of dramatic propulsion; narrative stasis becomes the norm, against which moments of splendor stand out. The plot suspends itself, like the reporter’s leg at the border, for the sake of pictorial and expressive impactoften on a stupendous scale. The effect arises not only from a canny play with history and memory but also from fresh revisions of staging principles stretching back through the 1950s to the first years of cinema.</p>
        <p>To what broader ends ? Granting the two-phase periodization of Angelopoulos’s work, we can note that in the films before <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera</em> all the techniques we have examined accord with the goals of a “<span>political modernism</span>”. By concentrating on groups and by staging in a manner at once minimalist and monumental, Angelopoulos blocks traditional paths to empathy. This yields a critical detachment that in turn invites us to reflect on the larger historical forces at work in a situation. The later work is more concentrated on the individual, delineating personal crises that express, as the emigrant author of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Suspended Step</em> puts it, fin de siecle melancholy. This tendency toward portraying psychological crises can be seen as well in Angelopoulos’s new reliance on major stars, on nondiegetic music, and on a more self-conscious spectacle. We might consider him to be offering us an updated version of “<span>Antoniennui</span>”. Both phases exploit slowness of rhythm, the vagaries of landscape, and sparseness of composition.</p>
        <p>I think that the two-part periodization holds good, but it is worth pointing out that Angelopoulos’s later work has not relinquished political critique. He tackles concrete political issues of his moment: the death of Marxism (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyage to Cythera, Ulysses’ Gaze</em>), the desperate flow of populations across European borders (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist, Suspended Step</em>), and the possibility of a national politics based on honor (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Suspended Step</em>). One can hardly imagine the Antonioni of the 1950s making a film about Algeria or the Berlin Wall, but Angelopoulos unswervingly bears witness to political crisis. Conversely, even in his “<span>Brechtian</span>” days he gave his work a strong emotional overlay. Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet, crucially influenced by Bresson, achieve a discomfiting emotional neutrality throughout their work, but Angelopoulos’s 1970s films, operating under the aegis of Antonioni, are soaked in feelings of solitude, bleakness, and futility. In both Straub/Huillet’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Not Reconciled</em> (1965) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Travelling Players</em>, cycles of national history are fractured into a complicated flashback structure, but the dedramatization is achieved in radically different ways. Straub and Huillet rely on disorienting cuts, closeups of nonactors stiffly reciting monologues, and temps morts that refuse to be read as expressing an atmosphere. Angelopoulos presents long takes, distant declamations, and stillnesses pervaded by oppression and muted despair.</p>
        <p>Across his career certain emphases have shifted, but he has always combined social critique-grounded at first in Marxism, now in humanist ethics-with a tone that, he claims, is not exactly pessimistic. “<span> I am a melancholic. And according to Aristotle, melancholy is the source of the creative spirit</span>”.<sup>50</sup> He sometimes attributes this tone to the lost 1960s dream of social revolution or to the insularity of most people today, cut off from each other and history.<sup>51</sup> But he also suggests that his melancholy has local sources: “<span>We live in a country of memories, of aged stone, of broken statues</span>”.<sup>52</sup></p>
        <p>Angelopoulos’s achievement shows how a filmmaking tradition can renew itself in the contemporary moment. He has pushed certain insights of Antonioni to new limits, encouraged by the achievements of others (Tarkovsky, Jancso, the minimalist radicals) and by broader aesthetic currents (Brechtianism particularly). Similarly, he has blended distinct stylistic schemas available in his milieu-the three-quarter view, the come -andgo pan, the deeply perspectival shot, and the planimetric framing-into an expressive whole. That he has won such renown suggests that for many viewers the postwar tradition has not exhausted itself, that it can endow our world of snack bars, video clips, and ethnic wars with a severe, contemplative beauty. At a moment when European cinema, both popular and elitist, seems to be aping Hollywood, Angelopoulos’s work takes on unique importance. Sometimes mannered, often maj estic, almost always melancholy, Angelopoulos demonstrates that, contrary to what the prophets of postrnodernity keep telling us, cinematic modernism can still open our eyes.</p>
        <p>Two Ways To Dedramatize Filmic Space</p>
        <p>Between the late and the early 1970s European filmmakers explored image schemas that could mute the flow of drama within a scene. Both schemas also constituted reactions against the deep-focus style that had emerged in American cinema in the 1940s. One sort of image makes use of what the art historian Heinrich Wölffin called “<span>recessive</span>” space.<sup>44</sup> Here figures and architectural space present diagonals that shoot from foreground to background. Directors from the 1940s to the 1960s had explored a deep-focus variant of the recessive image by placing the foreground plane quite close to the camera. Welles made this device part of his stylistic signature, and many directors around the world embraced the plunging deep-focus look (Fig. 442). The neorealists and Antonioni, however, often presented less-aggressive depth, setting the foreground plane a fair distance from the camera, as Japanese directors of the 1930s had. Wellesian depth hyperdramatizes the action by thrusting one plane out at us, whereas the milder recessiveness aids dedramatization, especially when combined with dorsality and vacant areas of the shot (Fig. 4-43) This image could make characters’ expressions and relationships less easy to read at one glance, and by avoiding a looming face or prop, this compositional device gave landscape and architecture more prominence (Fig. 4-44).===During the 1960s, recessive, wide-angle depth was contested by another strain of staging and shooting that, again following Wölffin, will call “<span>planimetric</span>”.<sup>45</sup> Here the background is resolutely perpendicular to the lens axis, and the figures stand fully frontal, in profile, or with their backs directly toward us. We can find early examples—even in Antonioni (Fig. the technique developed most evidently within the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">new waves</span>” of the late 1950s. Young directors gravitated toward a less volumetric, more self-consciously “<span>modernist</span>” image—flatter, obviously constructed, someti mes posing disconcerting optical puzzles (Fig. 446). Political modernists quickly picked up on the device: Godard’s to-camera monologues in La Chinoise (1967) became prototypes (Fig. 4-47). The new planimetric image was particularly suited to that ascetic strain of political modernism. It is central to Jeanne Dielmann (Fig. 4.22 above) as well as to Fassbinder’s most minimalist exercise, Katzelmacher (Fig. 4-48).</p>
        <p>The sources of this schema are various. Most proximately, during the 1960s, when shooting on location became more common, filmmakers used long (“<span>telephoto</span>”) lenses much more frequently, and these narrowed the playing area and flattened space into parallel planes (Fig. 4-49). Once these shots became common, many directors began elaborating images that looked more shallow and perpendicular. Greenbergian conceptions of modernism as “<span>asserting the picture plane</span>” and “<span>denying representational depth</span>”, disseminated through high culture in the 1960s and 1970s, may also have steered some filmmakers to these more abstract compositions.</p>
