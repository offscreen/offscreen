        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Feuillade, Or Storytelling</h2>
        <p>Louis Feuillade is probably the most prolific of the great filmmakers . Between 1906 and 1925 he made at least five hundred films for the Gaumont company-some only a few minutes long, others running more than seven hours. He worked in every genrecomedies, costume pictures, contemporary dramas, mystery films, sentimental melodramas, patriotic epics, even westerns shot in Parisian parks.</p>
        <p>He cast his lot with the mass audience. Brought up in the southern town of Lunel, he was a passionate cyclist, athlete, and bullfight fan, and it is not surprising that a lover of the corrida, with its unremitting physicality and frenzied crowds, should find in cinema “<span>the popular art of our time</span>”.<sup>1</sup> His films, he said, were aimed at the ticket punchers in the Metro, not the elite wooed by the avant-garde. For the public “<span>the only thing that counts is to know if, in [a film’s] twenty-six reels, there lies a sleeping princess whom a magician will awake with the beam of his marvelous lamp-I mean, a good story. That is the sole point: the story, the tale, the fiction, the dream</span>”.<sup>2</sup> Feuillade unabashedly put on display all the cliches of popular narrative. There are dying mothers, orphaned children, saucy maids, benevolent American millionaires, henpecked husbands, seductive adventuresses, and cunningly disguised villains armed with poison, bombs, and the power to hypnotize innocents. If you want your movie to sell, he told one director, hire a child or a dog.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>Hundreds of his films survive only as negatives, locked away in the Gaumont vaults, but by hopscotching among archives and revivals, one can study many of the works on which his reputation rests-very long movies made to be shown in installments. Feuillade’s first, and in many ways best, installment film was <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em> (1913-1914), based on the popular crime novels in which Inspector Juve and the journalist Fandor pursue the archcriminal Fantomas and his sinister mistress, Lady Beltham. Its successor was <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em> (1915-1916), “<span><em>grand film de mystere et d’aventures en plusieurs episodes</em></span>”, and thanks largely to the surrealists, it became Feuillade’s most famous work. Heavily improvised because of the constraints of wartime shooting, this delirious saga shows a criminal organization ransacking and terrorizing every level of French society. The investigators are the journalist Philippe Guerande and his sidekick Mazamette (owlish stage comedian Marcel Levesque), but the most charismatic figure is the anagrammatically named Irma Vep . Played by the kohl-eyed Musidora, Irma i s equal to any man i n treachery and resourcefulness. As the installments unfold, each new Vampire chieftain is captured or killed (usually because the actors were called to military duty), but Irma survives to the climax.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em> were called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">films aux episodes</em>, series in which the continuing characters passed through one self- contained adventure per installment, as in a TV series today. Then, imitating Pathe’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Perils of Pauline</em> (1914), Feuillade turned to serials proper, sometimes called cine-romans (“<span>film novels</span>”). These presented a long tale broken into segments, often accompanied by a serialized feuilleton in a daily newspaper.<sup>4</sup> Feuillade’s first serial was the most popular long film of his career, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Judex</em> (1917). Bowing to the public criticism that Les Vampires glorified crime, he gave his public a darkly handsome superhero. In sweeping cape and floppy hat, Rene Creste played the mysterious avenger who metes out justice with some help from the bumbling detective Cocantin (Levesque once more). Feuillade immediately made a sequel, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Nouvelle Mission de ]udex</em> (1917), and two more adventure serials, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tih Minh</em> (1919) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Barrabas</em> (1920), as well as the wartime drama <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vendemiaire</em> (1919). The vogue for crime films having passed, he turned to sentimental melodramas, which he also serialized on a grand scale.<sup>5</sup></p>
        <p>He was a tall, stocky man with large, heavy-lidded eyes and a close-cropped mustache stained by endless cigarettes. His duty, he said again and again, was to make the company profitable. He had a stake in those profits because Gaumont pegged part of Feuillade’s salary to the amount of finished footage he turned out, and he got a bonus if a film proved popular. So he enforced a ruthless efficiency. The former cavalry rider ran his team as a regiment, bellowing orders in a deep voice and using a drillmaster’s whistle to synchronize players’ gestures. He kept a cane handy, not to support himself but to snap during fits of rage. He forgave no infraction. When Jean Ayme, playing the leader of the Vampires, showed up late because of illness, Feuillade filmed Musidora blasting Ayme with a pistol. Getting up, Ayme asked what he should do next. “<span>Nothing</span>”, Feuillade told him. “<span>You’re dead. You’ve got no more to do in Les Vampires. Go to the cashier and collect your wages</span>”. Feuillade wrote a new chief Vampire into the next episode and never hired Ayme again.<sup>6</sup></p>
        <p>No time to spare for a sick actor; during the first several years, no time to work out scenes in advance. His players had to share his swift, intuitive craft and be ready to improvise. He usually couldn’t explain exactly what he wanted, so he would act it out, and soon he built up a stock company who learned what pleased him. His trusted players could sustain a shot for four minutes, and they would seldom need more than one take. Thanks to his unsparing discipline he could knock off a short film in an afternoon and a fortyminute episode in three days.<sup>7</sup> At a pinch, footage shot for one purpose could be squeezed into another film. Why, in the midst of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em>, is there suddenly an inserted tale featuring a horseman galloping after a bull ? Feuillade had shot the chase in Spain months before and wanted to use it somewhere.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, he also found time to run the studio. He was “<span>Artistic Director</span>” of the company, meeting with Leon Gaumont six mornings a week at 7:30. Filming started punctually an hour later. Feuillade bought stories, hired actors, and supervised other directors’ work. At night he read scripts. He seldom took vacations. His frail wife lived in Montpellier until her death in l911; his closest family, it seems, was his troupe. One of his actresses became his second wife, and his cameraman, Maurice Champreux, married his daughter. Loyal members of the team were guaranteed steady work for years.</p>
        <p>During the war, when the Paris studio proved difficult to maintain, Feuillade shot in Marseille, and in 1917 he relocated to the Gaumont facility in Nice. There, among roomy sets, picturesque estates, dazzling light, and rugged seashores and mountains, he could run everything to his liking. Every morning his assistant came to his courtyard, and from a window Feuillade would shout down the day’s requisites: a yacht, an Algerian birth certificate, a metallic spiral staircase one story high.<sup>8</sup> Filming became a family outing. The actors would arrive at the studio for a seven d clock breakfast, and over roasts, fish, and vegetables Feuillade would outline the day’s work. Around eight the cars would arrive to transport everyone to the location, where they filmed until nightfall. Then there was dinner at an inn, with singing.<sup>9</sup></p>
        <p>In Nice he reigned paternally over his troupe, turning out at least one cine-roman a year: the crime serials following judex, then the melodramas <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Deux gamines</em> (1921), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Orpheline</em> (1921), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Parisette</em> (1922), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Fils du Flibustier</em> (1922), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vindicta</em> (1923), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Orpheline de Paris</em> (1924). At a period when Gaumont had few hit films and the U S invasion of French screens was in full force, Feuillade could dictate terms. If Leon Gaumont wanted to see the latest footage, he had to come to Nice.<sup>10</sup> Feuillade died of peritonitis in 1925, aged only fifty-two; his last film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Stigmate</em>, was completed by Champreux.</p>
        <p>Feuillade flourished in a time of transition. When he started directing in 1906, films ran a reel (fifteen minutes) or less and were sold outright to exhibitors. The pictures looked very theatrical, with action staged far from the camera and performers waving and jumping about (Fig. 2.1). But films were starting to be shown in movie houses rather than vaudeville theaters and cabarets, and the audience was expanding. Soon movies grew to several reels, running from thirty to fifty minutes, and production companies realized that it was more profitable to rent prints than to sell them. The presentations became more upscale, providing customers printed programs like those in legitimate theater.<sup>11</sup></p>
        <p>Technique was also becoming more elaborate. American filmmakers were blending a variety of editing devices into a fast-paced, carefully calibrated style. A flurry of shots would trace characters bustling through doorways and rushing along sidewalks. Crosscutting might flash between simultaneous actions taking place in two locales . Some directors broke up a scene into medium shots and close-ups. The new style did not emerge in any steady, linear way, and there were false steps and blind alleys , but around 1917 the Americans consolidated a powerful storytelling strategy that involved building a scene out of several shots . A long shot, usually brief and at the start of the scene, would establish the characters’ positions. Then the bulk of the action was played out in medium shots and close -ups, usually taken from a variety of angles, so that characters’ expressions and gestures were magnified for clarity and impact. (See Figs. 2.2-2.4) This quickly became known as the “<span>continuity</span>” style, and it insured that at any given moment the most important bit of story information would be isolated for the viewer.<sup>12</sup></p>
        <p>European directors used such devices more sparingly. Exterior scenes would include some cutting, particularly in situations of spying or pursuit, but usually the action wouldn’t consume as many shots as the Americans would use. In interior scenes, editing would be even less important. Most of the action would be played out in a single orienting view, called in France the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tableau</em>. The nearest characters would be framed from the thighs or knees up. The director might cut in a close -up to show a letter or newspaper article or visiting card, since such items were too small to read in a master view. At a point of intense drama there might be a medium shot of a character’s reaction. Such a cut-in would probably be axial-that is, taken right along the lens axis of the tableau framing (Figs . 2.5-2.6) rather than from the oblique angles on display in many American scenes (Fig. 2.3). The axial cut-in is the most conservative strategy for breaking down the scene, since it is least likely to disorient the audience.</p>
        <p>The Europeans emphasis on the tableau led them to minimize crosscutting as well. In the last episode of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em>, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Bloody Wedding</span>” (June 1916), the journalist Philippe Guerande summons the police to the gang’s hideout, where they are celebrating their triumphs over staid society. Instead of swiftly alternating shots of Philippe waiting, the police racing to the rescue, and the Vampires partying, Feuillade gives us a thirtythree- second shot of Philippe standing in the street, with the police van emerging in the very far distance and eventually drawing up to him. Then come six shots of cops piling out and climbing over the estate’s wall (consuming fifty-two seconds). Only then does Feuillade cut back to the party, when the Vampires launch a dance that lasts a minute. Cut back outside, to two shots of the raiders approaching the house and entering through a rear door (forty-five seconds). Cut back to the party, where the chief Vampire amuses his crew by drawing a caricature of Mazamette and then firing his pistol at it, a gag that employs axial cut-ins and takes another seventy-five seconds. And then, as the Vampires strike up a frenzied dance in the full tableau, the police burst in at the rear.<sup>13</sup></p>
        <p>The nineteen shots in this sequence, the climax of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em>, average 15.5 seconds each (a characteristic ASL for any episode of the serial). By contrast, several American films from 1915 to 1916 average four to ten seconds per shot across their entire running time,<sup>14</sup> so a comparable climax in one of them would have a much lower ASL than Feuillade’s. Griffith and some of his contemporaries would have split the police raid into many more shots and crosscut more often among the converging dramatic forces. Consider Griffith’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Intolerance</em>, released only a few months after <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em> “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Bloody Wedding</span>” installment. The final phase of the rescue of the Boy from the gallows covers a mere ro2 seconds in thirty-six shots, yielding an ASL of only 2.8 seconds.<sup>15</sup> Just as important, Griffith repeatedly switches between the rescue party and scenes at the prison, returning to the Boy at the gallows six times. Feuillade makes do with a minimum of alternation: Philippe and the police (7 shots) / the Vampires (2 shots) / Philippe and the police (2 shots) / the Vampires interrupted by the police (8 shots).<sup>16</sup> He has not absorbed Griffith’s lesson that each line of action can be reduced to one brief, telling image (often a close-up), thereby enabling many more switches between plotlines.<sup>17</sup></p>
        <p>We shouldn’t exaggerate the differences: European filmmakers relied on a rudimentary form of continuity, and many American films employed virtuosic staging within the frame.<sup>18</sup> Still, the broad contrast provides a useful point of departure. Well into the late 1910s most directors outside the United States tended to favor ensemble performance within the sustained single shot.<sup>19</sup> Long before Alexandre Astruc asked, “<span>What is miseen- scene?</span>” European directors were providing brilliant examples.</p>
        <p>What did these filmmakers gain by playing down editing ? Feuillade can help us find an answer. He stands between the first generation of filmmakers (Lumiere, Melies) and that younger generation (Gance, I.:Herbier, Kuleshov, Dreyer, Murnau, Lang ) who took up the new American style. His pressurized production routines seem to have favored a technique far more straightforward than that developed by his contemporaries; he is, we might say, the Howard Hawks of the 1910s, exploiting current conventions of staging with an almost diagrammatic sobriety. His straight lines, uniform illumination, and sparsely decorated sets make his assured choreography of bodies in space all the more vivid.</p>
        <p>Start with one of the crucial representational tasks that every filmmaker faces: directing the viewer’s attention. The idea behind American-style cutting was that changing the shot scale and angle would highlight what is dramatically significant at each moment. Some Soviet directors, admiring the American methods, saw this guidance as a central virtue. A protracted full shot permitted the viewer’s attention to stray to a minor player or an irrelevant bit of setting, but a close-up drove the eye to the essential detail. What continuity advocates tended to ignore, however, was that before cutting intervenes, we are already scanning the frame for important elements, and many factors cooperate to guide us. As humans, we are likely to pay attention to other humans, particularly to the most informative features of their bodies: eyes, mouths, and hands. Fortunately, those are features that tend to carry a great deal of dramatic weight as well. In following the story we are encouraged to concentrate on characters-their carriage and expressions, their gestures and the props they handle. And since movies consist of images, the filmmaker must use pictorial cues to guide us too. The director can manipulate movement, the size of the figures in the frame, differences of tonality, and the compositional design as a whole. Such cues can reinforce the elements toward which our eye would gravitate anyhow, for example by centering the protagonist within the frame. Alternatively, pictorial cues can provide a gradation of emphasis whereby figures on whom we might spontaneously concentrate are given less weight than other components of the scene. A protagonist in the foreground, for instance, can turn away from us in order to draw our attention to someone in the distance.<sup>20</sup></p>
        <p>Moreover, in Feuillade’s day it was not enough to direct the spectator’s eye; one had to do so gracefully. Directors were expected to display a skill in pictorial composition-not least in order to help raise the cultural prestige of cinema. Feuillade wrote in 1910: “<span>In reality, the cinema proceeds as much, if not more, from the art of the painter than from that of the stage director, since cinema addresses itself to our eyes by combinations of light and changing tonalities, and by qualities of composition. Why have films not given us sensations of beauty comparable to those aroused by a painting by Millet or a fresco by Puvis de Chavannes ?</span>”<sup>21</sup> By 1910 a director could conceive the film image as requiring the kind of organization found in late-nineteenth-century academic painting.<sup>22</sup></p>
        <p>But how to achieve it ? The most obvious way to highlight a piece of information is to put it smack in the middle of the picture format, as Feuillade does in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Une nuit agitee</em> (Fig. 2.1). In several of his 1910s films Feuillade uses a stark geometrical centering to heighten the drama (Figs. 2.7-2.8). Often Feuillade utilizes the center to introduce new material, as when in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em> the supposedly dead bank courier reappears in the office and flabbergasts Irma Vep (Figs. 2.9-2.10). Yet this moment also indicates how even a little variance from geometric centering becomes quite compelling. No great sweeps of our eyes are required to move off center from the resurrected “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Spectre</span>” to Irma, or, in Figure 2.11, from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em> to the mysterious face in the train car above him and to the right. Such instances remind us that it is often useful to think of an image, in painting or in cinema, as having several different centers of interest. The challenge for the skillful director is to guide our attention among them. In another shot from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em> Feuillade tucks a doorbell into the right upper corner of the image, thereby setting himself the problem of directing the audience’s eyes to the ringing bell and back to Moche. Feuillade solves the problem by the straightforward expedient of obliging Moche to look at the bell (Fig. 2.12) and then turn to us, thoughtful (Fig. 2.13). In the l9ros, as today, an image need not be strictly centered if its design harmonizes elements within the frame.</p>
        <p>Such harmony usually involves one of two basic principles, both of which Feuillade handily delineates in his diverting 1908 short <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les agents tels qu’on nous les represente / Les agents tels qu’ils sont</em> (Policemen as We Portray Them/Policemen as They Are). The first part, consisting of a single shot, shows cops sneaking a smoke while an upright citizen is attacked and abducted by thieving apaches (Fig. 2.14). The second part employs two shots to present burglars spotted and pursued by tenacious policemen ( Figs. 2.15-2.16). The thieves are captured, but one cop i s wounded in the fray, and a final shot shows him recovering at a sanitarium, where he is awarded a medal ( Fig. 2.17). Each episode exploits a different staging schema. In the first the cops and robbers are stretched out laterally along a fence. In the second the action moves diagonally, as was common in chase films of the time, drawing the action from the distance into the foreground. (Interestingly, the satire on cinematic stereotypes utilizes the horizontal arrangement, whereas the portrayal of heroic cops “<span>as they are</span>” relies on deep diagonals, as if depth signaled greater realism.)</p>
        <p>When staging horizontally-that is, setting two or more figures on the same planeFeuillade sometimes leaves the center of the image vacant. This obliges him to organize the frame by balancing competing centers of attention, as in the shot of Moche’s doorbell (Figs. 2.12-2.13). Usually, however, such balance is not achieved by planting the figures in one place for the duration of the shot. Much of the appeal of Feuillade’s films, and of the cinema of his epoch, stems from the fact that cinematic composition creates not a snapshot but a dynamic flux whose stabilities and instabilities unfold over time. In the first part of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les agents</em> . . . , Feuillade carefully alternates centered action, such as the robbery of the passerby, with two centers of interest, spread symmetrically across the frame (Fig. 2.14). Feuillade and his contemporaries show that in the cinema centering, balance, and other pictorial strategies find their most subtle fulfillment instant by instant. An element may move out of the geometrical center, arousing a spatial tension that is relieved or developed by a new element’s arriving in the vacant spot. At such moments decentering may be only a prelude to recentering; directing the audience’s attention to one element often prepares for shifting attention to another item.</p>
        <p>Our study of Feuillade’s unfolding horizontal arrangements can start with a comparatively simple example from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bebe apache</em> (1910), one of his many comedies starring the child star Bebe. With his girl companion Bebe arrives at an outdoor party held by apaches. The first phase of the action seesaws from the extreme left of the frame (Figs . 2.18-2.20) to the right (Fig. 2.21), and the bulk of the scene develops in the geometrical center of the frame (Fig. 2.22). There is comparatively little sense of diagonal depth, and the main plane of action is quite distant from us.</p>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em>, three years later, Feuillade sets the action closer to the camera and creates a more spare and dramatic lateral arrangement. Lady Beltham has lured the actor Valgrand to her home while Gum (a.k.a. Fantomas) is lurking behind the curtain. The plan is to call the police and induce them to mistake the actor for the escaped convict he has portrayed onstage. The action starts with Lady Beltham seated on the left and Valgrand on the right (Fig. 2.23). He reacts to the drug she has put in his drink, and she walks to the right side of the frame. As she passes the center of the frame, the curtains part and Gum starts to peek out (Fig. 2.24). Once Lady Beltham arrives at Valgrand’s side, Feuillade has her look leftward, directing our eye back to Gum, who obligingly widens the curtain’s gap (Fig. 2.25). The revelation of Gum would not have been so vivid if Lady Beltham had not cleared his zone of the shot by going to frame right.</p>
        <p>The frame dynamic is soon inverted. Lady Beltham strides leftward, turning to Valgrand at about the center of the frame. This clears a space on frame right for the prison guards, who enter almost immediately. Gum closes the curtain (Fig. 2.26). After the guards have arrested the groggy actor and departed, Lady Beltham sees them out on the right while Gum emerges, creating a neatly balanced composition (Fig. 2.27). Throughout the scene, decentering serves only to resettle the shot and to direct attention to key elements.</p>
        <p>This example is instructive in another way. It reminds us that directors of the l9ros do not have to assume that every viewer must pick up on every item at the same instant. Rather, without seeming to be merely marking time, the director must stretch out an action long enough for all viewers to notice. For instance, perhaps some viewers spot Gum at the moment Lady Beltham starts her rightward stroll across the frame (Fig. 2.24). But by the time she turns to look at him as he peers out of the curtain (Fig. 2.25), most viewers have registered his presence. Feuillade can only prompt, not force, the spectator’s attention; but he can prompt it through a cascade of cues.</p>
        <p>We usually think that a deep pictorial space demands diagonal compositions, but lateral staging can achieve considerable depth by setting rows of figures perpendicular to the camera. Near the end of the same episode Juve believes that Fant6mas is disguised as Gum, so he brings Gum into the jail, only to discover that he is actually the actor Valgrand (with whom Fantomas/Gurn had switched identities). Instead of the single horizontal plane of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les agents</em> . . . , this scene is conceived in depth but with depth itself consisting of several parallel layers (Figs . 2.28-2 .34).</p>
        <p>The main alternative to lining actors up, either in one layer or several, is diagonal staging. Staging of this sort was common in exterior shots since the beginning of cinema, and within interiors it became more frequent between 1906 and 1913. Kristin Thompson has traced how American directors worked to fill the empty foreground area of interiors by designing sets with rear entryways and by placing furniture downstage so that figures were motivated to approach the camera.<sup>23</sup> Feuillade’s films make robust use of diagonal depth, usually with all planes in focus. Gaumont took pride in his films’ crystalline photography, achieved largely by shooting in daylight, both in exteriors and in sets built in the glass-walled studio. Sunlight allowed Feuillade’s cameramen to keep both foregrounds and backgrounds sharp, and moving to the brilliant climate of Nice only increased the prospect of extreme depth of field, an effect apparent in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Nouvelle Mission de Judex</em> and made altogether splendid in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tih Minh</em> (Figs. 2.7-2.8).</p>
        <p>Striking though diagonal depth is, it also poses compositional problems . Given players of comparable height, to put one closer to the camera is to unbalance the shot and give him or her more prominence. Three solutions suggest themselves. The director can push the more distant figure to the geometrical center of the format, compensating for its lesser size by its prime location. In some scenes we’ve already examined, a background figure gains saliency simply because it is more centered than a foreground one (Fig. 2.9). A second solution relies o n the fact that in cinema a s in painting, frontality i s an eyecatcher. So a foreground figure can compensate for its large size by turning its (and our) attention to a more frontal figure in the distance. This is what happens when the bank manager swivels to call attention to the disguised courier in Fig. 2.10. Finally, the depth arrangement can exploit movement. We can add visual weight to the smaller figure by letting it change position while the foreground actor stays comparatively still. This tactic operates in Figs. 2.31-2.32.<sup>24</sup> All three tactics allow depth staging to achieve compositional balance.</p>
        <p>As with lateral staging, the most dynamic depth compositions are constantly being reconfigured, so very often the person in the rear creates compositional balance in yet another way-by moving to the foreground. From the very beginning of cinema, directors displayed a strong urge, at least in exteriors, to pull distant figures to meet their counterparts in the front of the shot.<sup>25</sup> This tactic not only permits performers to interact on the same plane; it also promotes compositional stability by spreading roughly equal masses across the frame. Thus diagonal interaction often becomes only one moment in a suite of activities that culminates in horizontal layout. And, since the foreground area is by optical necessity narrower than that of the background, characters coming forward are squeezed closer together. With its effect of enlarging the figures, bringing them to the same plane, and narrowing the gap between them, the movement from background to foreground became the norm for initiating a scene’s action or developing the drama to a higher pitch.</p>
        <p>Feuillade pursues exactly these implications of forward-thrusting action, as a simple example from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em> will illustrate. The crooked prison guard Nibet calls on Lady Beltham, preparatory to the substitution of Valgrand for Gum. He arrives far back in the shot, while she stands downstage. But by turning away from the camera, she grants Nibet some saliency (Fig. 2.35). Moreover, instead of having him simply walk to the vacant foreground chair on the right, Feuillade has Lady Beltham cross to sit in the chair while he strides diagonally forward to assume her previous position (Fig. 2.36). By passing through the central zone of the shot, Nibet receives momentary emphasis before he sits on the love seat on the left, rebalancing the shot.</p>
        <p>Again, once Feuillade has mastered this principle, he sets himself fresh difficulties. During one scene of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Nouvelle Mission de Judex</em>, the foreground figures pile up so rapidly that Feuillade must juggle them very carefully. He draws two, then three, then four men from the distance into a crowded middle ground (Figs. 2.37-2.41). To make things interesting, he adds a woman. Her arrival motivates a judicious cut-in (Fig. 2.42), after which the front-row ensemble has been reconfigured to make room for her (Fig. 2.43-2.44). Feuillade solves his visual problems by elegant rules of thumb: line the figures up in planes; given an even-numbered group, balance them around the frame’s vertical axis; with an odd-numbered grouping keep one figure in the center.</p>
        <p>And, we might add, block and clear a central avenue for upcoming developments. At intervals Roger conceals the doorway (Figs . 2.39, 2.41), which is revealed at just the right moments when he swings aside (Figs. 2 .40, 2.43). More sustained is the virtuosic play with visibility in the opening scene of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em>. The journalist Philippe Guerande comes in to his office and finds his dossier on the Vampires missing; he accuses the clerk, Mazamette, who confesses. Apart from some titles and inserts of written matter and a photograph, Feuillade plays out the four-minute scene within a single camera setup. Philippe enters through the rear door-an aperture that, throughout the scene, will frame foreground elements and provide a channel for entrances and exits (Fig. 2.45). In the frontmost plane Philippe bends to investigate the drawer, and his body blocks the central journalist (Fig. 2.46). This allows our attention to shift to Mazamette’s worried response, given in a fairly frontal view: we may already start to suspect that he is the culprit. Philippe rises as he discovers the robbery, and Feuillade further calls our attention to Mazamette by having him rise in synchronization on frame left (Fig. 2.47). Philippe interrogates his colleagues, and Mazamette tries to sneak out in the distance. Philippe’s body blocks our view of him, accentuating the moment when, clearly if distantly in view on the threshold, Mazamette is halted by Philippe’s question (Fig. 2.48). Thereafter, as Philippe interrogates Mazamette in the foreground, the pair alternately block the other journalists and reveal their reactions (Fig. 2.49).</p>
        <p>Note that this sequence could not be as tightly choreographed on the stage. For those spectators at the center of the auditorium, Philippe’s entry (Fig. 2-45) would be visible in the gap between his two colleagues. But for the theatergoers on the side Philippe would be partly blocked in the course of his entrance. For viewers in the balcony his face would not be centered between them. Similarly, the moment when Mazamette halts in the doorway (Fig. 2.46) could not be seen by everyone in a theater situation; for many viewers Philippe would be standing in the way. And the minute blocking and revealing of the reporters simply could not be achieved on the stage, since only a few spectators would have a view corresponding to that given in our image.</p>
        <p>Theater staging, working within a wide and shallow rectangle, tends to be spacious and lateral, spreading the figures out to accommodate many sightlines. By contrast, thanks to the laws of optics, the film camera captures a pyramidal chunk of space, with the tip of the pyramid at the lens and the playing. space radiating out from there (See box, Fig. 2.50). Since the camera views a unique configuration of bodies in space, you can not only pack the shot with many figures and objects. You can move each one as slightly as you like, blocking or exposing whatever area is necessary, all in the confidence that, in contrast to the live-theater situation, every viewer can easily notice the changes. This is what allows the samovar and the uncle’s head (Figs. 1.33-1.41) to blod: the revolutionary’s daughter so exactly.</p>
        <p>The tactic of blockage and revelation thus becomes one of the most useful tools in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">metteur en scene</em>’s kit. Blocking and revealing can guide the spectator’s attention quite delicately across layered arrangements , as we’ve seen when the crowd of top-hatted officials momentarily blots out Juve and allows us to concentrate on Valgrand (Fig. 2.30). The tactic can work in diagonal layouts, too, as the opening sequence of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em> shows: thanks to the optical pyramid, tiny slices of space slip in and out of view when actors shift position.</p>
        <p>One schema for unobtrusively guiding the viewer’s attention lets a downstage character occupy a maj or zone before moving away to reveal another figure that is en route to the foreground. We’ve seen a simple example already in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bebe apache</em>, where the apaches in the front slide off to let us see the children’s arrival (Figs. 2.18-2.20); their movement prepares us to watch the area they vacate. A scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Nouvelle Mission de Judex</em> provides a more graceful integration of frame balancing with this blocking-and-clearing maneuver. Judex traps two crooks in a cellar and materializes behind them. The most rudimentary diagonal staging would have put the two men in a foreground corner, with Judex emerging from the opposite side of the background. And indeed, the shot begins with the two men in the far right foreground (Fig. 2.51). But when they hear Judex shout, “<span>You’re prisoners! Throw down your weapons!</span>” they move forward and leftward as they drop their guns and raise their hands (Fig. 2.52). There’s now a problem of visibility: the man with the cap blocks the doorway. So while his partner halts, he continues leftward just as the door opens (Fig. 2.53), and Judex is revealed (Fig. 2.54). The crook continues his westerly drift until Judex stretches his arm commandingly across the doorway (Fig. 2.55). The man’s foreground movement wiping across the doorway draws our attention to the center while also delaying and underscoring the revelation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Judex</em>. The crook’s final freezing in place gives the climax of the shot a nicely triangulated stability.</p>
        <p>What is striking in nearly every instance I’ve mentioned is the timing of a coordinated ensemble. Despite the haste with which these films were made, the synchronization of movements and poses is uncannily precise. Exactly as the Spectre turns away to be led to the background, Irma Vep swings back to us so that we can register her shock (Fig. 2.10). In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em>, when Fandor follows Nibet and his accomplice through an underground passage over a canal, Feuillade brilliantly orchestrates the characters’ silhouettes leaping from side to side, pursuing each other in a gentle oscillation across the central axis, blending moments of poise with symmetrical arrangements (Figs. 2.56-2.58). Could any director today execute the opening of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em>, that ballet of smooth changes of position and short, sharp instants of stasis involving so many figures in a stationary shot ? Our practitioners of intensified continuity don’t display much mastery of flexible centering, the use of doors and windows to mark out zones of action, the virtually unnoticeable balancing and rebalancing of the frame, the subtle pivoting of characters to and from the camera, the power of lateral staging, the rush to the foreground and the clearing of the front line, the slight shifts that conceal and reveal background action. Feuillade’s films of the 19ros offer inexhaustible lessons in a craft nearly forgotten. They show us how the simple choreography of bodies in space can create a dynamic, intelligible presentation of a scene’s action. The same tactics were employed by Feuillade’s peers too, but he gave them a trim efficacy that suited the swiftly moving stories he had to tell.</p>
        <p>While Feuillade and his European contemporaries were refining techniques of ensemble staging, American filmmakers were developing editing tactics that crystallized into the Hollywood continuity system. Many of these devices appeared sporadically in earlier European and Russian films. Directors felt free to cut to action in adjacent rooms or hall-ways or nearby areas outdoors. The “<span>insert</span>” of printed matter or a photograph was very common. Well before 1913 Feuillade occasionally used closer views, changes of angle, and point-of-view shots,<sup>30</sup> and the films I’m considering here display a gradual adoption of continuity devices .</p>
        <p>The reciprocities between staging and editing ought not to surprise us, since both are tactics for guiding our attention. Most European filmmakers (and some of their US counterparts) treat cutting not as an absolute alternative to staging in depth but rather as a complement to it, often an instrument of it. Broadly speaking, American decoupage after 1915 subordinates staging to editing. The master shot establishes and orients; the space will be articulated primarily through closer views , matches on vision or movement, cuts to adjacent spaces, and the like. These carry us to the heart of the action (Figs. 2.2-2.4). Here cutting back to the long shot serves as a transition, usually to show the characters moving into a new arrangement, which will then be dissected by a new passage of analytical editing. Sometimes the cut back to an establishing shot will provide an expressive accent: in today’s cinema, a cut back to a master shot underscores a moment of tension or a pregnant silence. Still, in this tradition, from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The On-the-Square Girl</em> (Figs. 2.2-2-4) to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jerry Maguire</em> (Figs . 1.46-1.59), the primary burden of a drama within a single locale is carried by analytical cutting and shot/reverse shots.</p>
        <p>To this we can counterpose an alternative that was prominent in Europe during the 1910s-a minimal continuity editing in which the tableau carries the dramatic weight. The few closer views tend to be straight cut-ins, serving usually to enlarge small items like letters and newspaper articles. Less often, the cut-in creates an accent, even a slight shift in emotional register, usually by enlarging a character’s expression at a key moment. This minimal or attenuated continuity editing, subordinated to staging, can highlight a region of the tableau for our scrutiny-as in one moment of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Judex</em>, when a single closeup of a photograph assures that we will make it a target in the dynamic of glances played out in the full shot (Figs. 2.59-2.62).</p>
        <p>Throughout the scene the photograph of Jacqueline Favraux sits quite visibly in the foreground right of Judex’s desk, and we have plenty of time to become aware of it. Sometimes, however, composition or movement in the tableau cannot sufficiently stress dramatic factors, and then cutting can supplement staging. Sometimes this leads to remarkably daring decoupage. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tih Minh</em> the Marquise Dolores is stealing Sir Francis Grey’s wallet, but she hides herself when he enters. Grey bends over his drugged valet, alongside a full-length mirror (Fig. 2.63). A sharp-eyed viewer may spot, in the bottom of the mirror’s reflection, Dolores’s face peering out from under the bed. Feuillade could have seized our attention by letting Dolores make a big movement, but instead he cuts in to the reflection at the moment she pokes a revolver out (Fig. 2.64). More boldly, a return to the initial framing shows the pistol firing (Fig. 2.65) and Grey ducking aside (Fig. 2.66) before he hurls himself onto the offscreen bed-an action revealed in the upper right of the reflection (Fig. 2.67). The close -up has encouraged the viewer to attend to a slice of space available in the mirror, highlighting the narrative action while also leading us to notice activity around the bed, an adjacent region of reflected depth.</p>
        <p>In such ways the principle of enlarging a detail can be extended to a piece of action, even when the staging makes that action difficult to see. Our example of characters rushing toward the foreground desk in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Nouvelle Mission de Judex</em> has shown that the blocking- and- concealment strategy can be combined with editing: when Jacqueline comes into the room, Feuillade cuts in to her (Fig. 2.42) before returning to the master shot (Fig. 2 -43). Here Feuillade’s cut stresses the character whose reaction will be most important. ( Judex has just insisted that she not be told of the danger facing her family.) But the more general principle seems to be that when a foreground figure blocks something in depth, that may motivate a cut to whatever is momentarily concealed (Figs. 2.68-2.70).</p>
        <p>In our early example from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The On-the-Square Girl</em> the figure entering in the background is perfectly visible in the establishing shot (Fig. 2.2), and the cut drastically shifts camera position to show Rene’s disdainful reaction (2.3) before enlarging Anne’s face (Fig. 2.4) Feuillade, however, remains tied to the camera axis; in our <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tih Minh</em> case (Figs. 2.68-2.70) he cuts directly “<span>through</span>” Jeanne to Jacques and provides no reverse shot of her. Curious though this practice may seem today, it suggests that Feuillade feels obliged to provide a closer view only when something cannot be made fully visible in the long shot because it is tiny ( printed matter, a photo), peripheral (a hand under a bed), or blocked from view. (Had Feuillade been directing the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On-the-Square</em> scene, he would presumably have made Rene’s expression visible by having him turn to face the camera, as we’ve seen in Figs. 2.10, 2.43, and 2.47) In this respect, as others, Feuillade’s method seems typical of the . European approach. Directors staging in depth tended to push their luck, filling the frame with so many blocked and revealed figures that some actors were obscured. An axial cut could bring those souls back into the action, even if the positions did not match perfectly (as often happens in Feuillade).</p>
        <p>So the 1910s director could choose between full-fledged decoupage in the American manner, which emphasized the string of closer views from varied angles, and a kind of sparse or attenuated continuity, which emphasized the full shot and supplemented it with a cut-in or two. Alternatively, the director could treat the larger views and the cut-ins as roughly equal in weight. This usually occurs when the cut-ins are not tight close -ups but medium shots, and fairly densely composed ones at that. Interestingly, they don’t fulfill the Soviets’ dictum that an insert should carry only one piece of information. Feuillade and his contemporaries show that cutting together moderately close views can creatively rearrange data given in the full view.</p>
        <p>For instance, during the famous gun battle among the barrels in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em>, changing camera positions yield a variety of foreground/ background configurations, all anchored in adjacent space by the skiff moored in the distance (Figs . 2 .71-2.73 ). No less remarkable, though more dramatically motivated, is the banquet scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Judex</em>. As the guests at banker Favraux’s home await the clock’s striking ten, Feuillade’s analytical editing permutes the elements of the scene, preserving and refreshing the depth relations (Figs. 2.74-2.76). Arguably, this is a more inventive use of closer views than the fairly naked medium shots of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The On-the-Square Girl</em> (Figs. 2.3-2.4). Historians influenced by Kuleshov and Pudovkin have too often presupposed that cutting to closer views necessarily reduces and simplifies the pictorial field. Feuillade’s jammed but cogently composed midrange shots remind us that guiding the audience’s attention is still necessary when the camera is fairly close to its subjects.</p>
        <p>Feuillade was not entirely conservative; he adopted continuity devices selectively and gradually.<em class="notranslate" translate="no"> Judex</em> (1917) sometimes opens scenes with medium shots of characters , and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Nouvelle Mission</em> (1917) includes occasional shot/reverse shots and matches on action, although usually without distinctly changing the angle or penetrating the scenic space in the US manner. Across the 1910s his cutting pace accelerates, rising from 17.1 seconds per shot for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantomas</em> (1913) to 7.6 seconds for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Barrabas</em> (1919). By the time he made <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Deux gamines</em>, Feuillade was exploring most of the decoupage alternatives I’ve reviewed. Some scenes are built almost completely out of stripped-down American-style medium shots (Figs. 2 .77- 2 .78). Others revert to tightly timed depth staging, with cut-ins to accentuate a scenic element. In one clever scene the girl Ginette goes with her benefactor Bersange to see her father, now working in a cafe (Figs. 2.79-2.84). Such moments show that complex staging was not an absolute alternative to editing but could often be supplemented and strengthened by it.</p>
        <p>In his last years Feuillade converted to something close to decoupage in the American manner. All eight of the 1920s films that I’ve seen have AS Ls between four and seven seconds . Sometimes scenes of physical action are cut very fast; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Orphe’line</em> (1921) contains shots shaved down to five or six frames . In these films Feuillade’s staging serves principally to arrange figures in the establishing shot and reestablishing shots . Ironically, now his long shots often avoid depth in favor of simple lateral layouts . He seldom attempts shot/reverse-shot cutting in these films (and when he does, he sometimes botches it). Instead, his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cine-romans</em> rely on a characteristically cheap and fast solution, one he had explored in the 1917 serials: the medium two-shot showing people in lengthy conversation (Fig. 2.85), broken by many dialogue titles. (In some of his late films, titles constitute a fifth of all shots.) As prudent a strategy as any he adopted earlier, the sustained two-shot minimized changes of camera position. This proto-talking-cinema style doubtless allowed him to turn out footage quickly. By the early 1920s he had added a second cameraman, who would film details while the principal camera concentrated on the whole scene.<sup>31</sup> Moments of clever staging crop up in Feuillade’s late films, but by and large he had abandoned complex choreography.</p>
        <p>Feuillade’s staging principles grow out of two decades of explorations conducted by filmmakers throughout Europe. We can trace the principles back to the Lumiere films, although a more proximate predecessor would be the French “<span>Film d’Art</span>” cycle, an effort to upgrade the new medium by importing plots and players from the legitimate stage. The most famous Film d’Art production, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Assassinat du Due de Guise</em> (1908), was long deprecated by historians who saw editing as the essence of cinema. Although granting that the film brought a new realism of performance to cinema, Georges Sadoul claimed that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Assassinat</em> “<span>retains, ten years after <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Affaire Dreyfas</em></span>”, the technique which Melies created in his Montreuil studio. The film didn’t know, didn’t even suspect, the existence of editing [<em class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</em>] , although several contemporaneous films had begun to make systematic use of it. The work is merely a succession of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tableaux vivants</em>, each scene taken from a vantage point centered in the orchestra seats. In this respect, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Due de Guise</em> is a piece of filmed theatre.<sup>32</sup> Eventually, historians would praise <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Assassinat</em> for its smooth contiguity cutting, which carries its hapless title character through a series of adjacent rooms.<sup>33</sup> Now we can see that the film also constitutes a model of the techniques of balance, aperture framing, and precisely timed rearrangement that would be so important for the next dozen years. The scene leading up to the assassination opens with the duke moving toward the camera; it closes with his exit via the same doorway. Across the scene the actors play out a ballet of blocking and revealing, concentrated in a few zones of spatial and dramatic tension (Figs . 2.86 -2.87). As early as 1908, then, filmmakers were creatively exploiting cinema’s trapezoidal playing space to create precise compositions. Our early examples like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bebe apache</em> suggest that Feuillade mastered the staging tactics on display in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Assassinat</em> and proceeded to bend them to his own ends.</p>
        <p>In studying those ends I’ve concentrated on certain denotative qualities, particularly the ways in which staging steers our attention to narratively salient information. Instant by instant Feuillade draws our eye to the most important zones of the frame without our being aware of the process. This is a primary goal of any plot- driven cinema. Only by tracking the flow of the drama can we respond with curiosity, suspense, or surprise. In order to enjoy the stages through which Valgrand falls into the trap laid by Fantomas and Lady Beltham, we must follow Feuillade’s lead and pick up on the salient shifts of figures (Figs . 2.23-2.27). With a lovely inevitability each image provides a wholly adequate viewpoint on the action. At bottom, Feuillade’s staging techniques function as crisp, unobtrusive cinematic narration. His work reveals a kind of optimal design within the 19ros long-take tradition.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that his style lacks expressive qualities. The clean lines of his staging permit a relatively understated acting. “<span>Feuillade asked us to suppress the useless gestures of pantomime</span>”, the actor Rene Navarre remarked years later. “<span>He all but forced me to keep my hands in my pockets and to act just with my eyes and my body.<sup>34</sup> In the crime serials the sobriety of staging and performance throw into relief the outlandish plot twists</span>”. A python slithering out of an air duct or a cannon assembled in a hotel room are treated as laconically as a man slitting open a telegram at the breakfast table. Moreover, although the pithiness of the staging doesn’t invite us to call it “<span>ornamental</span>”, it displays a strong impulse toward symmetry, echo effects, visual tensions sustained until they subtly resolve-all of which can be savored for their own sake. Throughout, Feuillade sets himself problems that he overcomes, often in elegant ways.</p>
        <p>Feuillade eventually won a measure of fame outside specialist circles; at intervals <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em> is rediscovered as a great classic that is also good fun. (Perhaps some day the same recognition will be granted to the superb <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tih Minh</em> and Feuillade’s sparkling short comedies.) Yet the subtleties of his art remain little appreciated. Even less celebrated are his gifted contemporaries who worked in the same tradition. First among them, it now seems, was Victor Sjostrom, remembered more for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Phantom Carriage</em> (1921) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Wind</em> (1928) than for his splendid films of the early 19ros, particularly the masterpiece <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ingeborg Holm</em> (1913).<sup>35</sup> There are other masters well worth studying, such as the Swedish director Georg af Klercker, who delighted in cramming his interiors with tables, lamps, armchairs, and hanging curtains, creating a maze of furnishings that the actors would negotiate unflappably. In effect, he plays Visconti to Feuillade’s Hawks (Fig. 2.88). There is also Robert Reinert, a German filmmaker who also presents a well-filled frame, but thanks to the narrowing tip of the optical pyramid, he stages many scenes in claustrophobic proximity to us (Fig. 2.89). Eisenstein might say that Reinert employs montage within the shot, but we can also see his tactic as one European director’s way of finding functional equivalents of cut-ins, a solution that yields a bonus-an expressively asymmetrical composition that heightens the intensity of the developing action.<sup>36</sup></p>
        <p>Both Klercker and Reinert give us quite florid elaborations of the premises that governed Feuillade’s staging. Wilder still are the baroque inventions offered in Yevgenii Bauer’s films. He, too, found ways of packing his sets, particularly with massive columns, which divide the space into zones and provide opportunities for character hide-and-seek. One of Bauer’s most memorable scenes, however, uses yawning vertical spaces surrounding his characters in order to disorient us again and again.</p>
        <p>The intertitles for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The King of Paris</em> (1917) have been lost, so it’s difficult to reconstruct the exact purport of the scene taking place on the staircase. Yet that hasn’t kept it from becoming a favorite of researchers into l9ros film.<sup>37</sup> The rapacious Marquis de Predalgonde, the “<span>king</span>” of the title, flirts with a young woman in a large foyer. After she leaves, he talks with his mentor, Rascol. Nothing complicated about this, except for a simple addition to the decor: a stupendous mirror. It stands across from a large open staircase, and it has an extraordinary power to confound our sense of the locale. At the start of the shot, because we cannot see the edges of the mirror, we are inclined to assume that it starts on the left and ends midway into the image, with the staircase extending rightward past the central column and off into the background. Bauer confirms this assumption at the outset of the shot by showing the woman touching up her hair, complete with reflection, while other women go up the stairs on the right side (Fig. 2.90). We cannot know that they too are reflections in the same mirror.</p>
        <p>The shot unfolds as a string of weird incompatibilities and delays. At one point, in reflection the marquis seems to be moving quite close to the woman (Fig. 2.91), but in reality he is far away, indeed off-frame right (Fig. 2.92); it’s as if there are actually two couples, mimicking each other slightly out of sync. Similarly, when the marquis chats with the woman, the spatial cues force us to assume that Rascal is descending the stairs behind them, in a classic eavesdropper situation (Fig. 2.93). Yet when the woman bolts out frame right (Fig. 2.94), she suddenly reappears (Fig. 2.95) in a reflection on the very stairs we thought we were observing directly, revealing as well that Rascal has been standing not behind the couple but across the foyer facing them. This challenge to our sense of the layout is reinforced after a pause: Rascal descends the stair (Fig. 2.96) and enters not from the background but from the right, coming to stand by the marquis (Fig. 2.97).</p>
        <p>So robust i s the illusion that we have to struggle constantly to remember that the staircase “<span>behind</span>” the characters is actually offscreen. Bauer cunningly gives us a recognizable mirror in the left half of the frame and a “<span>hidden</span>” mirror in the right half. Whereas Feuillade strives for a maximally informative spatial layout, Bauer exploits our perceptual inclinations in order to disorient us (in a manner reminiscent of Manet’s famous painting <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bar at the Folies Bergere</em>). Perhaps the original dialogue in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The King of Paris</em> gave these treacherous reflections a thematic significance, but in any event the virtuosic play with illusion seeks to frustrate our efforts to grasp the action, while also indulging in flagrant pattern making-a swerve toward a decorative use of style.</p>
        <p>How might we explain the emergence of such a rich tradition of staging in the period 1908-1920? If we reflect on the tasks and problems faced by filmmakers, we can sketch out some answers. E. H. Gombrich has suggested that many changes in the history of visual representation can be understood as efforts to adapt inherited visual forms (the “<span>schemas</span>” I’ve invoked) to new purposes or functions. One example is the growth of realistic painting in Europe around the thirteenth century. The Christian Church, Gombrich argues, sought to dramatize sacred stories for the unlettered faithful. In order to fulfill this purpose, artists experimented with ways to depict figures and locales with greater expressiveness and spatial realism. Painters were obliged to adapt the schemas available to them, drawing on the narrative painting of the Greeks and on the Hellenistic traits that persisted in Byzantine art. Once artists had discovered new means of realistic and expressive depiction, those very means became ends in themselves, and artists competed to find ever-more evocative and virtuosic ways to render the appearance of the visible world.<sup>38</sup></p>
        <p>Imagine a similar process at work in film around 1909. From the start films had tended to grow longer. One-shot films became multiple-shot films; multiple-shot films became one-reelers; films expanded to several reels and then to feature length-all in response to industrial and cultural demands. As films got longer, they were obliged to tell more complicated tales.<sup>39</sup> So filmmakers linked episodes, embedded stories within stories, multiplied lines of action, added twists and complications, and created more complex characters. At the level of style directors were faced with several tasks, notably that of guiding the audience’s attention to the most important elements of these increasingly complicated plots. And as the film became longer, the director would have to find ways to intensify the audience’s emotional involvement-to make the extra time spent on the film a satisfying investment.</p>
        <p>One cluster of solutions was pursued by the Americans: let editing pick out a scene’s salient details, switch from one plotline to another, and arouse the viewer through delay and suspense. Another option was to direct the audience’s attention by means of more intricate staging. This alternative encouraged directors to expand their compositional repertoire so that the audience could follow a more elaborate intrigue and enj oy a stronger emotional response. From this perspective Philippe’s discovery of the rifled dossier in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Vampires</em> ( Figs. 2.45-2.49) and the piling up of figures in the foreground desk of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Nouvelle Mission de Judex</em> (Figs. 2.37-2.44) constitute elegant solutions to the problem of conveying a rapid flow of story events while also maximizing curiosity and excitement.</p>
        <p>Another goal may have governed filmmakers’ efforts. As films became longer and moved into dedicated venues, apologists for the new medium sought to justify film’s cultural credentials. The prestige of literature and theater could legitimize cinema, so directors drew plots , players, and techniques from the stage.<sup>40</sup> Significantly, as we’ve seen, Feuillade broached the idea that artistic cinema would borrow from tasteful salon painting. His efforts to balance the frame. smoothly, to create an overall visual dynamic that lets each narrative element stand out cleanly at the proper moment, may constitute another means of differentiating a more aesthetically dignified cinema from its comparatively crude predecessors.</p>
        <p>Any new means that Feuillade and his contemporaries might devise could build on deep-seated visual predispositions: the eye is attracted by contrast, frontality, movement; and specific items, such as faces and gazes. At the same time, filmmakers could borrow and modify certain pictorial devices already available in their milieu. Many tactics, such as turning from the viewer, letting secondary characters look at key figures, and balancing figures laterally, probably came from the theater. Comparable schemas were doubtless available from academic painting, particularly realist and narrative traditions of the late nineteenth century. Consider, as one example, William Frederick Yeames’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Defendant and Counsel</em> (1895; Fig. 2.98). The dark-robed lawyers balance the brightly lit defendant, and the men’s wigs and profiles form a wedge pointing to the pale, frontally positioned woman on the right. One task that Feuillade and his peers set themselves was to shift actors into and out of such harmonious compositions, extending to the moving image principles of visual design already canonized in academic art.<sup>41</sup></p>
        <p>Gombrich also points out “<span>Each gain or progress in one direction entails a loss in another</span>”.<sup>42</sup> The Renaissance painter had to reconcile the commitment to a new realism of detail with the demands of clear and harmonious composition.<sup>43</sup> Similarly, Kristin Thompson has suggested that editing was a mixed blessing for early film, with the cut promising a freedom of time and space but also threatening a loss of narrative clarity.<sup>44</sup> From this standpoint the mise- en-scene of the European tradition can be seen as a conservative, low-risk strategy. At a time of stylistic change directors who had already mastered ways of guiding the viewer within the sustained shot may have been reluctant to tackle the new demands of continuity editing.</p>
        <p>Economic factors may also have played a role. A cinema dominated by editing required fairly careful planning, if not full-blown shooting scripts. (As Feuillade cut more, he began to write out his scripts in more detail.) By contrast, staging-based production can get by with less blueprinting. Cutting-based shooting also requires new production roles, such as that of the American “<span>script girl</span>”, who kept track of the many camera setups. If the director has authority in the studio and works with the same personnel from film to film, as Feuillade did, a style based on long takes can be very efficient, turning out many minutes of footage per day. Feuillade was paid by the meter, so any time spent planning rather than filming would eventually have to justify itself in greater output. Perhaps directors in Europe, Russia, and the Nordic countries relied on master scenes for so long partly because they had no incentives to embrace the pre- and postproduction control afforded by editing or the constraining routine of shooting many setups.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, a reliance on long takes triggered problems—problems of pacing, of maintaining interest, and of keeping everything in proportionate significance as the action unfolded. Precision staging in depth offered a reliable solution. A frontal figure in the foreground is an eye-catcher, a point of orientation for the rest of the action. By presenting other figures as competing centers of interest, or as engaged in more vigorous movement, the director could balance the shot and encourage a scanning that would pick out the salient elements. And, as we’ve seen, the powerful advantages of carrying the players downstage coordinate naturally with the rising tension of a scene’s action. To adopt precision staging, however, initiates a fresh crop of problems. Once characters move closer to the camera, they occupy more frame space and may mask important action behind them. Hence the need to alter the arrangement in the course of the scene. Diagonal layouts of figures become lateral ones in the foreground (Figs . 2.35- 2.36), lateral arrangements rotate or oscillate around the central axis (Figs. 2.23-2.27), impulses thrusting directly to the camera hit the foreground and spread out (Figs. 2.38-2.44).</p>
        <p>The admirable choreography developed by Feuillade and his contemporaries constitutes a sustained effort to shape the viewer’s attention by ever-more refined control of composition and depth relations. Once the incentive to innovate was in place, artists had a formal problem: to shape existing schemas to the new demands of narrative presentation. Feuillade and his peers discovered staging techniques adequate to films displaying more twists of action and greater emotional complexities than the one -reelers of earlier years. As filmmakers’ mastery increased, many also explored the expressive resources of staging. They set themselves new difficulties, often sheerly for the sake of overcoming them. In the process they created a cinema of subtle beauty.</p>
