                </header>
                <p>God is the name by which I designate all things which cross my wilful path violently and recklessly, all things which upset my subjective views, plans and intentions and change the course of my life for better or worse. (Edinger, 1986: 32)</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Symbolic Life</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Jung’s whole approach to living centred around leading a symbolic life guided by the symbolic language revealed in dreams. In this way, the individual could reach a degree of self-understanding which would lead to a full and meaningful life. Jung’s view was that any individual coming into therapy was ultimately in quest of a spiritual solution to their problems and that this resolution could only come through developing a capacity for symbolization. It is this that is at the centre of Jung’s approach, which he called ‘analytical psychology’.</p>
                <p>Jung was aware of the decreasing influence of religion and ritual in the everyday life of most individuals and of the consequent impoverishment of daily life. ‘We have no symbolic life and we are all badly in need of the symbolic life. Only the symbolic life can express . . . the daily need of the soul. . . Everything is banal . . . and that is the reason why people are neurotic’ (Jung, 1977: 274).</p>
                <p>Jung’s definition of symbol is that it is ‘the best possible description or formulation of a relatively unknown fact, which is nonetheless known to exist or is postulated as existing’ (Jung, 1971: 474). Symbols are different at different historical epochs and, like everything in life, symbols have their day and then cease to be. Their function is to play a psychological mediatory and transitional role through which they can add to the personality of an individual and point attention to another position which may help to resolve an individual’s conflict.</p>
                <p>Poignantly, Jung writes about the transitory nature of symbolism in the following manner: ‘We cannot turn the wheel backwards; we cannot go back to the symbolism that is gone’ (Jung, 1977: 276). In this passage he is writing about the symbolism of the Mass in the Catholic Church and says that because Catholics are contained in this they find protection in the lap of the all-compassionate Mother. For those who have lost their religious roots, their souls become lonely and they are in a state of non-salvation and become neurotic. Jung was a life-long Protestant who tried to reintroduce dogmatic symbolism.</p>
                <p>Symbol formation is an unconscious response to a consciously perceived problem and its origin is in the <em>archetypal</em> realm which lies beyond that of consciousness. The former is the innate, nonpersonal part of the psyche also called by Jung the <em>collective unconscious</em>. The archetypal language of the collective unconscious expresses itself through imagery, fantasies and symbols and has a separate existence from ego consciousness or the known part of the psyche. These two realms may be united by what Jung termed the <em>transcendent function</em> and he later spelt the divine aspect of the <em>Self</em> with a capital ‘S’ to distinguish it from the use of self as denoting a person’s identity.</p>
                <p>In Jung’s approach, the conscious and unconscious realms are seen as compensatory to each other and it is the transcendent function that enables the transition of contents from one realm to the other. It is this self-regulating function of the psyche which leads to psychic health in the individual but it is just this self-regulating that has, according to Jung, been eliminated in civilized humankind by critical attention and directed will. Unconscious material is needed for the transcendent function to become activated but Jung thought that dream material does not have sufficient energy for this purpose. Nor do unconscious slips because these are too fragmentary. Instead, fantasy is necessary and this must be allowed free play while the individual remains as conscious as possible. This latter prerequisite is an essential part of what is known in analytical psychology as <em>active imagination</em>. This will be elaborated further in Chapter 3.</p>
                <p>While fantasy is vital to the above process, so too is the function of the ego, which Jung saw as being at the centre of consciousness. It must take the lead and must not be overwhelmed by unconscious contents. An important way forward in activating the transcendent function is the development of an inner dialogue. Through this transcending of opposites, consciousness is widened by confrontation with unconscious, symbolic contents. From a teleological or purposeful point of view, Jung argued that the transcendent function does not proceed without aim and purpose but can enable a person to move beyond pointless conflict and avoid one-sidedness and direct them onto the path of <em>individuating</em>. The <em>individuation</em> process is the end goal of an in-depth Jungian analysis and is the way of wholeness and distinctness from others.</p>
                <p>This introduction to Jung’s psychology has a t its heart the idea of the healing power of the symbol. So central was this to his approach that many of his papers have the word ‘symbol’ in their title and two of the books of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em> are called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>, 1912, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Symbolic Life</em>, 1977.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Texts</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Most of the material reproduced here on Jung’s personal life is taken from various texts, including: Jung’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>; Bennet’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">CG. Jung</em>; and Ellenberger’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Discovery of the Unconscious</em>. The first of these has claims to being Jung’s autobiography but this has been disputed by the Jung scholar, Sonu Shamdasani in his paper, ‘Memories, Dreams, Omissions’. The reason he gives for his critique is that large tracts of what Jung dictated to his secretary, Aniela Jaffe, have been omitted. There are also telling ‘omissions’ with regard to the degree of unhappiness in the parental marriage and in relation to the seriousness of Jung’s mother’s depression. According to R. F. C. Hull, who translated Jung’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em> into English, Jung visited him in 1960 and told him that he did not want his work to be ‘auntified’ and that he personally would see that it did not happen. However, Jung died in 1961 before this could be ensured.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, much was made of Jung’s omissions. On the one hand, Jung was much criticised for the absence of any mention of his lifelong extramarital affair with Toni Wolff, of figures such as Eugen Bleuler and Pierre Janet, and the vexed issue of his alleged collaboration with the Nazis. (Shamdasani, 1995: 120)</p>
                <p>The latter, in particular, continues to be used as an indictment of the Jungian movement.</p>
                <p>Thomas Kirsch (2000) states that the first three chapters on Jung’s childhood in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memories, Dreams, Reflections are</em> his own writing but the rest is Aniela Jaffe’s, based upon the notes she took in conversation with Jung. Only half the manuscript is contained in the book because legal battles have kept the remaining material from being published.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em> was published in 1963 as Jung’s autobiography instead of as a biography. D.W. Winnicott wrote a long and famous review of it at the time in which he says that Jung’s picture of himself in the book shows that he was suffering from childhood schizophrenia (Winnicott, 1964). This mental split was eventually healed, according to Winnicott, but resulted in a life-long quest for ‘the self. The theme of duality runs throughout Jung’s writing and he recounts that at the age of four or five he became aware of another personality, an older man from the eighteenth century, as part of himself. He named his four-year-old self No. l personality and the second No. 2. Bennet suggests that this may have been the beginning of Jung’s theory of the collective unconscious.</p>
                <p>For reasons stated above, I have checked everything I have used from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em> as far as possible against what Jung said personally to E.A. Bennet, reproduced in the latter’s 1961 book, C.G. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung</em>. Bennet was himself a Jungian analyst and close friend to Jung, who stayed with him in London in 1935 while he was delivering the Tavistock Lectures. Bennet, an establishment figure who was a general in the army and a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudesley Hospital, was a member of one of the first Jungian institutes to be founded in 1946 in London, the Society of Analytical Psychology (SAP). Bennet was a ‘classical Jungian’, that is one who has remained faithful to Jung’s own teachings and found himself increasingly at odds with the psychoanalytic drift at the SAP. He eventually resigned in 1963.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Early Life</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Carl Gustav Jung was born on 26 July 1875, at Kesswil by Lake Constance in Switzerland. Before his birth two boys had been born to his parents, both of whom died in infancy and so Jung remained an only child until a sister, Trudi, was born when he was nine years old. He grew up with country girls and boys, which, he claimed, gave him an early education in sex and led to him being surprised later in life at Freud’s attaching so much importance to sexual matters.</p>
                <p>Jung’s father was a parson of the Basel Reformed Church and an Oriental and classical scholar, who taught him Latin from the age of six. His father showed an early promise of being a Hebrew scholar and married the daughter of his Hebrew teacher. Jung found his mother enigmatic because of her unpredictable moods and described her as alternately pleasant and uncanny. She spent a few months in a mental hospital in Basel when Jung was a child and he seems never to have forgiven her for her absence.</p>
                <p>One persistent family legend was that Jung’s grandfather, Carl Gustav Jung, was the natural son of Goethe and from the time in his youth that his mother introduced him to Goethe’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em>, the writer was a life-long inspiration for Jung.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Important dreams</h3>
                <p>At the age of four Jung had a dream which stayed with him for years. He first told it to his wife when he was 65 years of age and subsequently to E.A. Bennet—this is an illustration of how introverted Jung was. He recounted the dream to Bennet as follows:</p>
                <p>He dreamt he was alone in the field beside their home where he usually played, when to his surprise he noticed a square hole in the ground. Filled with curiosity, he looked into the hole and saw a flight of stone steps; down these he went slowly, with hesitation. At the bottom was a door covered with a green curtain, which he pulled aside. To his amazement, he saw a large, rectangular room with stone walls; a strip of red carpet stretched from the door to the opposite end, where there was a dais with steps, and upon it a big chair. It was not an ordinary chair, but a large golden throne with a red cushion, and on it rested what he took to be a tree trunk about twelve inches high. This had a red, fleshy top, a sort of head, not yet shaped as a head, with an opening like the eye of a demonic god. He had never before seen such a thing and had no idea what it could be, but he felt a strong wave of panic. Then he heard his mother calling to him. Her voice was quite clear, as though she were at the entrance to the steps in the field, yet he realized - in the dream - that she was in the house about 200 yards away. ‘Just look at him,’ she said. ‘He is the Man-eater.’ Here the dream ended. (Bennet, 1961: 10)</p>
                <p>It was only many years after having the dream that Jung realized that it was about the phallic <em>archetype</em>: the principle of creativity in life. Another dream at the age of 12 was probably the most significant one of his whole life. He reported it to Bennet a s follows:</p>
                <p>I was in the rather gloomy courtyard of the Gymnasium at Basel, a beautiful medieval building. From the courtyard I went through the big entrance where the coaches used to come in, and there before me was the Cathedral of Basel, the sun shining on the roof of coloured tiles, recently renovated, a most impressive sight. Above the Cathedral God was sitting on His throne. I thought: ‘How beautiful it all is! What a wonderful world this is - how perfect, how complete, how full of harmony.’ Then something happened, so unexpected and so shattering that I woke up. There the dream ended. I could not allow myself to <em>think</em> of what I had seen, for had I done so I would be compelled to accept it, and this I couldn’t possibly do. So I made every effort to put the thought from my mind. (Bennet, 1961: 12)</p>
                <p>He had a sleepless night or two trying to repress the terrible part of the dream as he was at the time a devout Christian following the religious teaching of his pastor father. When he could finally face the thoughts that came out of this dream he realized that God had poured scorn on the Church, his father’s teachings and his own beliefs. The acceptance of this gave him the self-assurance that he was now a person in his own right.</p>
                <p>The two lengthy accounts above about dreams illustrate the influence of these early intimate experiences on Jung. He was an <em>introvert</em>, that is, someone for whom the inner world has far more importance than that of the outer world of objects, and he claimed that what took place in his own mind was of greater significance than anything else in life. He exemplifies <em>introverted thinking</em>, which will be elaborated in the section on his typology further in the book.</p>
                <p>The above dreams represent two key childhood experiences for Jung. There were other ritualized acts that were part of his secret life and helped him with his feelings of uncertainty about the world at large. He had a pencil case that was given to all school children at the time and in this was lodged a ruler. At the end of this he carved a manikin with a frock coat, top hat and black boots and hid this in the pencil case with a coloured stone in the attic of his house, which he would visit from time to time. In adulthood, he linked this ritual to the sacred stones of aboriginals and came to see it as emanating from the collective unconscious which is common to all human beings. It was these kinds of ritual that were highly symbolic for Jung and not the ritual of organized religion associated with his father. Wood carving was something he enjoyed doing in itself and, according to his grandson, he often whittled away and gave carved pieces of wood to his friends.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Student years</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Jung was an indifferent pupil until his twelfth year when he fell and hit his head on a kerbstone. He heard an inner voice saying that he would not have to go to school any more and from that time had frequent fainting spells whenever he had to return to school. For a while, all he could think of was indulging his passion for solitude and nature. His parents grew increasingly worried about him but it was only when he heard his father wondering what would become of him if he could not earn his own living that he realized that he must get down to work. From that time he was an industrious student at the Gymnasium, where he spent his school years.</p>
                <p>After school he was faced with the difficult choice of what to study at university and found himself pulled between science and the humanities. On the one hand, it seemed to Jung that if he chose science he would be studying something real but he was strongly drawn to philosophy and to Egyptology and was inclined to take up archaeology. Once again, Jung experienced this internal conflict as that between his No. l and No. 2 personalities and his worried father expressed it thus: ‘The boy is interested in everything imaginable, but he does not know what he wants’ (Jung, 1963b: 104). His father had been in poor health for some time and died shortly after, in 1896.</p>
                <p>As a result of two dreams around this time, Jung finally decided on science and the thought suddenly came to him that he could take up medicine like his paternal grandfather. In any case, due to the family’s impecunious state he had to restrict himself to studying at Basle University where he could do medicine. Even then his father had to apply to the University for a stipend for Jung.</p>
                <p>The conflicting internal dialogue between No. l and No. 2 personalities continued but his awareness was increasing that No.2 personality was a total vision of life, of meaning and historical continuity. This connected him with Goethe’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em> and Jung became convinced that in this character Goethe had portrayed the answer to his time. From now on, Jung gratefully acknowledged Goethe as his spiritual godfather. He also felt this about Nietzsche’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zarathustra</em> when he read <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Thus Spake Zarathustra</em>. About this time he had the following dream:</p>
                <p>It was night in some unknown place, and I was making slow and painful headway against a mighty wind. Dense fog was flying along everywhere. I had my hands cupped around a tiny light which threatened to go out at any moment. Everything depended on my keeping this little light alive. Suddenly I had the feeling that something was coming up behind me. I looked back, and saw a gigantic black figure following me. But at the same moment I was conscious, in spite of my terror, that I must keep my little light going through night and wind, regardless of all dangers. (Jung, 1963b: 108)</p>
                <p>For Jung, the illuminating power of the dream lay in the realization that it was his No. l personality, with all its limitations, that offered the light of consciousness against the superior intelligence and timelessness of the No. 2 inner personality. ‘As far a s we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being’ (Jung, 1963b: 358). For now, it was his No. l personality’s task to take up the challenges posed by the external world - those of study, money-making, responsibilities, etc. Interest in the Occult In 1898 the time was approaching when Jung had to start thinking of which branch of medicine to specialize in. He was initially inclined to surgery but an incident occurred that changed this. One day during the summer holidays his mother was sitting in the dining-room next door to the room in which Jung was studying. Suddenly, the dining-table, which was a family heirloom about 70 years old, split from the rim to the centre with a deafening explosion. Two weeks later, a similar sound was heard from the sideboard and, on investigation, Jung found that the blade of the bread knife had split in several places.</p>
                <p>There was no rational explanation for either occurrence. A short time later, Jung joined some of his relatives who were engaged in table-turning using his cousin, Helene Preiswerk, as a medium. Jung’s interest in the occult increased during the course of these seances and his doctoral thesis, published in 1902, was based on them. Its title was <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On the Psychology and Pathology of So-called Occult Phenomena</em>. This was written some time after the seances had finished and was greatly influenced by the work of the French- Swiss psychiatrist, Theodore Flournoy. Around this time, Jung was also drawn to the work on the occult conducted by the English physicist, William Crookes, and by the American philosopher and psychologist, William James (brother of the novelist, Henry James). However, it was Flournoy’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Prom India to the Planet Mars</em>, that was the model for Jung’s doctoral thesis. The reason for this, Sonu Shamdasani points out, was as follows: ‘In comparison to Janet, Flournoy posited the existence of non-pathological and creative components of the subconscious, and stressed that automatic activity, such as the productions of the trance states of mediums, need not be inferior to voluntary activity’ (Shamdasani, 1998a: 118). Shamdasani’s own three-volume work on Jung is in progress.</p>
                <p>In order to disguise his cousin’s identity, she is called ‘S.W.’ in the thesis. The seances would start with those present joining hands on the table at which point it would begin to move. S.W. gradually went off into an ecstatic sleep where she would recount on waking that she played a distinguished role in the spiritual world. Her name in that world was Tvenes’ and she visited relatives or found herself in the Beyond in ‘that space between the stars which people think is empty, but which really contains countless spirit worlds’ (Jung, 1957: 33). Jung modelled much of his thesis on the way that Flournoy had written <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Prom India to the Planet Mars</em>. In this way, he depicted Tvenes’ as a psychogenic potential aspect of Helene’s, who was in advance of her conscious personality.</p>
                <p>As Tvenes’ she understood and spoke the language of the spirits, who still speak to one another out of habit even though they do not need to do so as they can see one another’s thoughts. On her return from an ecstatic sleep, she would describe the characteristics of the spirits, for instance, that they do not study science and philosophy but are far advanced in technology. She also disclosed that she had been through several incarnations. There was a great deal of interest in double personality towards the end of the nineteenth century and Jung was no exception. As we will see, he continued to be interested in it throughout his life.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychiatric Studies</h3>
                </header>
                <p>In keeping with his interest in double personality, Jung had decided to specialize in psychiatry and in 1900 he took up his post at the Burghölzli Mental Hospital in Zurich under the celebrated psychiatrist, Eugen Bleuler. Here he undertook research into the nature of the psychoses and, in particular, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dementia praecox</em> (a term coined by Bleuler) or schizophrenia. Bleuler was a vital figure in starting Jung on his professional life by giving him his first post. If Jung had succeeded to the Chair in Psychiatry at the Burghölzli after Bleuler stood down he may well have stayed in psychiatry. He and Bleuler also collaborated on the project they shared in working with schizophrenia.</p>
                <p>While at the Burghölzli he became interested in the wordassociation test that was discovered by the German experimental psychologist, Wilhelm Wundt. The latter’s work was enormously formative of Jung’s thinking, whose basic mindset was psychology. Wundt’s word-association test was already in use at the Burghölzli in treating psychotic patients and Bleuler had drawn up a list of 156 stimulus words and using a stop-watch would time a patient’s response to each. Bleuler became interested in comparing this experiment on psychotic patients with one on normal people and asked Jung to test several men and women in this way. Jung observed that the individuals were susceptible not only to external distractions but also to internal ones.</p>
                <p>Theodor Ziehen, the German psychiatrist, had discovered the ‘feeling-toned <em>complex’</em> in 1898—a combination of images and ideas clustered around an emotional centre. Jung became increasingly interested in <em>complexes</em> and developed the work Bleuler was doing with word-association tests further in experimenting with them. Jung first became interested in complex theory through attending Pierre Janet’s seminars at the Salpetriere Hospital. Janet had followed in the steps of the great neurologist, Jean- Martin Charcot, with whom the former had planned to collaborate on experimental psychology before Charcot’s sudden death in 1893. Janet’s concepts exerted a considerable influence on psychiatry and the rising school of psychoanalysis. Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia was largely derived from Janet’s on psychasthenia, where the basic disturbance is the lowering of psychological tension. Freud was influenced by concepts such as the ‘subconscious’, ‘psychological analysis’ and the ‘fonction du reel’ which led to the ‘reality principle’. Freud was particularly influenced by Janet’s work in bringing ‘subconscious fixed ideas’ back to consciousness through the patient’s transference onto the doctor.</p>
                <p>Alfred Adler’s ‘inferiority complex’ derived from Janet’s ‘sentiment d’incompletude’ and the term ‘complex’, which came to have so much importance for Jung, grew out of ‘subconscious fixed ideas’. Jung also became interested in other concepts from Janet like ‘double consciousness’, the ‘lowering of the conscious level’ and his work on introverted and extraverted personality. However, when Janet claimed priority over psychoanalysis for the discovery of concepts like ‘fixed ideas’ and ‘catharsis’, Jung and Ernest Jones attacked him at the London Congress in 1913.</p>
                <p>Although Janet’s work continues to be immensely influential on French psychiatry, his published work is hard to obtain elsewhere. As Ellenberger says at the conclusion of the chapter on him: ‘Thus, Janet’s work can be compared to a vast city buried beneath ashes, like Pompeii’ (Ellenberger, 1970: 409).</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychiatry</h3>
                </header>
                <p>To return to Jung’s work at the Burghölzli Hospital, the hospital itself had gained a considerable reputation in the world of psychiatry for the enlightened approach of its practitioners. Auguste Forel, Bleuler’s French predecessor, had taken up hypnotism and written a great deal on the subject. By the time Jung arrived there in 1900, hypnotism was still being used as a treatment and he practised it a great deal and, for a while, was in charge of the hypnotism clinic. However, Jung tired of hypnotism as it appeared to him to be superficial and although he used it successfully in the elimination of symptoms, it in no way helped to shed light on the meaning of those symptoms. The latter was what really interested him.</p>
                <p>Forel’s other interests were also to play a part in Jung’s development - for instance, he put together a combined social, psychological and anthropological study on sexuality. He was also a devotee of eugenics, the study of human improvement by genetic means, and was more of an extremist than the English eugenicist, Francis Galton. Forel’s ideas in this area are the instigators of Jung’s Larmarckian views as expressed in his writings on a racial psyche. Jung’s approach to the study of histology followed a similar path to the one he displayed with regard to hypnotism. He threw himself into it with enthusiasm at first and conducted microscopic examinations of brain tissue but this in turn proved unavailing in enlightening him about ‘the intruders of the mind’, as he called mental disturbances such as hallucinations and delusions.</p>
                <p>In addition to this work, Jung spent a great deal of time talking to patients in the wards hoping that in this way he would discover something about the origins of their illness and what their symptoms meant to them. One woman patient had been an inmate for 40 years and was treated by the nurses as just another senile patient. She had a habit of moving her hands up and down and shovelling food into her mouth in this way, which the medical students diagnosed as catatonic schizophrenia.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, Jung asked one of the nurses if she knew anything about the patient’s personal history. The nurse replied that there was some connection with shoemaking and Jung was struck by the resemblance between the patient’s hand movements and those of the cobblers he had seen at work. When the patient died, her brother came to the hospital and Jung asked him why his sister had been admitted to the hospital. He said that his sister had gone mad when she had been jilted by a shoemaker. This case led to Jung proposing that there was a psychogenic element in dementia praecox/schizophrenia.</p>
                <p>Jung also continued with, and greatly elaborated, his work on the word-association test. This had originally been used as a kind of intelligence test but was of little use in this regard. Along with the time taken for a response to each word, Jung also often recorded the rate of heart-beat and respiration, as well as the psycho-galvanic reaction. The graph of such a test showed a correspondence between the verbal response and the respiration rate which, in turn, demonstrated that the mind and body worked in unison. In other words, the responses to the test depended on the emotional and not the intellectual state of the participant. Along with a colleague, Jung published a paper, ‘Psycho-physical Investigations with the Galvanometer and Pneumograph in Normal and Insane Individuals’, which showed that the influence of emotion can be demonstrated physiologically as well as psychologically.</p>
                <p>In a paper Jung published on a female patient suffering from paranoid dementia he illustrates how he used the association test. She was an unmarried dressmaker who had heard voices slandering her for years before she was admitted as an inpatient. They told her that she was a doubtful character, that her child had been found in a toilet, and that she had stolen a pair of scissors in order to poke a child’s eyes out. As a result, she often thought of drowning herself and was admitted to hospital in 1887.</p>
                <p>The patient produced vivid delusions which were at first coherent, such as that she had a fortune of many millions and that her bed was full of needles. Gradually these became less coherent and more grandiose, for instance, she claimed to be Noah’s Ark and the Empress Alexandra. Over the course of two years, Jung took simple word tests from her but each stimulus word was followed by a prolonged silence sometimes lasting up to 14 seconds. The following are a few examples of her associations.</p>
                <p>To the stimulus word ‘pupil’ she responded ‘Socrates’; to ‘love’, ‘great abuses’; to ‘ring’, ‘bond’, ‘alliance’, or ‘betrothal’. The long time in responding shows that these are all complex constellations and the seeming lack of affect is related in dementia praecox to the fact that affect is deeply repressed. The extraordinarily long time in responding may be explained by the continual interference of the complexes, which assimilate everything that come within their orbit.</p>
                <p>With this patient the three complexes that can be deduced from the association tests are: <em>the complex of personal grandeur, the complex of injury-</em>, and <em>the erotic complex</em>. Jung thought that the latter may be the most important one but that it was displaced by the first two. This patient was also given to neologisms - making up new words - which is another symptom of dementia praecox. When Jung tried to get her to explain a neologism ‘she immediately came out with a string of fresh neologisms resembling a word salad’ (Jung, 1960a: 111).</p>
                <p>Jung’s approach to this patient, which demonstrates what a gifted psychiatrist he was, is encapsulated in the summary he makes at the end of the long case history he wrote on her. He points to the fact that the confused and senseless fantasies the patient has constructed in her psychosis have similarities with ‘dream-thoughts’ in their symbolic imagery. He puts it this way: ‘The patient describes for us in her symptoms, the hopes and disappointments of her life, just as a poet might who is moved by an inner, creative impulse’ (Jung, 1960a: 144). He goes on to say: ‘In dreams he remoulds his complexes into symbolic forms, in a disconnected, aphoristic manner, and only seldom do the dream-formations assume a broader, more coherent structure, for this requires complexes of poetic—or hysterical—intensity.’ These symptoms expressed symbolically become more understandable once the patient’s life-history is taken into account. What Jung is at pains to show in his psychiatric work is how dreamformations develop out of complexes and how a patient’s conscious psychic activity may be limited to a systematic creation of fantasies that ‘compensate’ for a wretched life. For Jung, the psyche works in a compensatory way to balance the conscious attitude.</p>
                <p>There were several important results of the lengthy research Jung conducted with the association test. One was that this confirmed his theory about complexes which became one of his central theories to the extent that many years later he seriously thought of calling his approach ‘Complex Psychology’. Another was that complexes were shown to be located in the personal unconscious and were not part of the realm of the collective unconscious. A further, related result, was that the experiments demonstrated the autonomous character of complexes which behave independently of conscious thoughts and wishes and which can affect objects and people in the person’s vicinity like a poltergeist. The Jungian term <em>constellation</em> related to complexes refers to a psychologically charged moment when the contents of a complex are about to manifest in consciousness. This may be experienced as disturbing or exhilarating depending on the affect with which the complex is imbued.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most important result of the association tests was the part it played in bringing Jung and Freud into collaboration with each other. From Jung’s point of view, the tests confirmed the latter’s theory of repression, one of the cornerstones of psychoanalysis, which threw light on how complexes worked. For Freud, on the other hand, the association tests conducted by Jung provided a scientific underpinning to important parts of his work. As to the association tests themselves, Jung found the paraphernalia surrounding them cumbersome and increasingly boring and a hindrance to the doctor - patient relationship. He used them less and less and eventually abandoned them altogether.</p>

                </header>
                <p>‘From the start of my psychiatric career the studies of Breuer and Freud, along with the work of Pierre Janet, provided me with a wealth of suggestion and stimuli’ (Jung, 1963b: 169). In his obituary on Freud in 1939 Jung wrote that his work was ‘epoch-making’ and ‘probably the boldest attempt that has ever been made to master the riddles of the unconscious psyche upon the apparently firm ground of empiricism. For us, then young psychiatrists, it was . . . a source of illumination, while for our older colleagues it was an object of mockery’ (Jung, 1963b: 169).</p>
                <p>Jung’s first meeting with Freud took place on 27 February 1907, at Freud’s home in Vienna, although the two had been corresponding for a year and Jung had been applying Freudian concepts in his work since 1904. This was illustrated in his linking the thought-formations produced by schizophrenics with dreamformations as he became more and more impressed with Freud’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Interpretation of Dreams</em>. Their friendship and collaboration lasted for seven years, from 1907 to 1913, although Jung continued as the President of the International Psycho-Analytical Association until 1914. Volume 4 of Jung’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em> is entitled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Freud and Psychoanalysis</em>, and incorporates his writings on Freud from 1906 - 16 with a couple of later additions. In the earlier papers on psychoanalysis, Jung ardently defends classical Freudian concepts such as the sexual aetiology of neurosis and the theory of dreams, including manifest and latent content, wish-fulfilment, condensation and the dream censor. However, even at the outset Jung expresses doubt with regard to the sexual theory in a letter to Freud in 1907, as follows:</p>
                <p>Do you regard sexuality as the mother of all feelings? Isn’t sexuality for you merely one component of the personality (albeit the most important), and isn’t the sexual complex therefore the most important and most frequent component in the clinical picture of hysteria? Are there not hysterical symptoms which, though co-determined by the sexual complex, are predominantly conditioned by a sublimation or by a non-sexual complex (profession, job, etc.)? (Maguire, 1974: 79)</p>
                <p>Let us look at Jung analysing a dream according to Freudian precepts. We shall see later in this book how much Jung’s approach t o dream analysis changed after the break with Freud. The following is a dream told to Jung by a man of whose intimate life Jung was ignorant at the time:</p>
                <p>I found myself in a little room, seated at a table beside Pope Pius X, whose features were far more handsome than they are in reality, which surprised me. I saw on one side of our room a great apartment with a table sumptuously laid, and a crowd of ladies in evening-dress. Suddenly I felt a need to urinate, and I went out. On my return the need was repeated; I went out again, and this happened several times. Finally I woke up, wanting to urinate. (Jung, 1961: 31)</p>
                <p>The dreamer was an intelligent and well-educated man who felt that the dream was meaningless and due only to a physiological urge. Jung asked him what his associations to the Pope were and he replied that ‘the Pope lives royally’ (Jung, 1961: 32). His associations to sitting next to the Pope were that he had been seated next to a Sheikh who was polygamous whose guest he had been in Arabia. ‘The Sheikh is a sort of Pope’ (Jung, 1961: 32). Jung says that the idea behind the dream seems clear: the man is a celibate like the Pope but would like to have many wives like the Sheikh. Other associations to the dream were to the sumptuously laden table which reminded him that he would shortly have to go to the wedding of two friends of his. The urge to urinate linked to the fact that he wet his trousers at the wedding ceremony of a relative when he was 11 years old. The associations to the handsome features of the Pope were in particular to the nose, which was exceedingly well-formed. This was like the nose of a woman in whom the dreamer was currently interested. Also, the Pope’s mouth was very shapely and this reminded the dreamer of another woman in whom he was interested. Jung summarizes this part of the dream as follows: he says that the ‘Pope’ is a good example of condensation in synthesizing the dreamer because of his celibate life, but also the polygamous Sheikh. He is also two women in whom the dreamer is interested and the associations to weddings are linked to these. The later papers increasingly show Jung’s growing criticism of psychoanalysis and, in particular, of the sexual theory. In a paper on the Oedipus complex and the problem of incest, Jung puts forward his own theory as follows: ‘Here religion is a great help because, by the bridge of the symbol, it leads his libido away from the infantile objects (parents) towards the symbolic representatives of the past’ (Jung, 1961: 156).</p>
                <p>The paper ends on a note of complete rejection of Freud’s Oedipus complex:</p>
                <p>He therefore takes the tendency towards incest to be an absolutely concrete sexual wish, for he calls this complex the root-complex, or nucleus, of the neuroses and is inclined, viewing this as the original one, to reduce practically the whole psychology of the neuroses, as well as many other phenomena in the realm of the mind, to this one complex. (Jung, 1961: 156)</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sexual theory</h3>
                </header>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em> Jung says that he had doubts from the beginning about Freud’s theory that sexual repression and trauma were the cause of all neuroses. However, because he felt that Freud had opened up a new path of investigation, Jung tried to suppress his own misgivings. He says that on occasion when he tried to air them Freud would attribute these to Jung’s lack of experience. On one occasion in 1910 Jung recalls Freud saying to him: ‘My dear Jung, promise me never to abandon the sexual theory. That is the most essential thing of all. You see, we must make a dogma of it, an unshakable bulwark.’</p>
                <p>Jung asked what it was a bulwark against and Freud famously replied: ‘Against the black tide of mud of occultism’ (Jung, 1963b: 173). This confirmed Jung’s intuition that for Freud sexuality was a sort of <em>‘numinosum’</em>—that is a tremendous and compelling force akin to religious experience. ‘Freud, who had always made much of his irreligiosity, had n ow constructed a dogma; or rather, in the place of a jealous God whom he had lost, he had substituted another compelling image, that of sexuality’ (Jung, 1963b: 174).</p>
                <p>In the early 1900s when Jung was first coming in contact with Freud’s ideas, the latter was still <em>persona non grata</em> in academic and scientific circles. Jung himself had mixed feelings about the fact that his association experiments were in agreement with Freud’s theories and was tempted to publish his conclusions without mentioning Freud’s name. But then he heard the voice of No. 2 personality saying: ‘If you do a thing like that, as if you had no knowledge of Freud, it would be a piece of trickery. You cannot build your life upon a lie’ (Jung, 1963b: 171).</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Heir Apparent</h3>
                </header>
                <p>From this time on, Jung became an open supporter of Freud and in 1906 published a paper, ‘Freud’s Theory of Hysteria: A Reply to Aschaffenburg’, supporting him. He was warned by two German professors that he was endangering his academic career but nevertheless went on defending Freud. In 1907, the latter invited Jung and his wife to visit him in Vienna. As this was one of the great meetings of minds of the last century, I will give two brief accounts of it - one from the Jungian perspective, the other from the Freudian.</p>
                <p>Jung in his turn was eager to know Freud, and he records that he was the most remarkable person he had then met. Their first talk, in Freud’s house, lasted for thirteen hours! . . . According to Jung, the talk was protracted because he continued to question Freud, hoping to get beyond these limitations, and in particular Freud’s insistence on the importance of the infantile sexual trauma as a settled, unalterable basis of his work. (Bennet, 1961: 33)</p>
                <p>In July 1907 at the International Congress of Neurology in Amsterdam:</p>
                <p>Jung gave me a lively account of his first interview (with Freud). He had very much to tell Freud and to ask him, and with intense animation he poured forth in a spate for three whole hours. Then the patient, absorbed listener interrupted him with the suggestion that they conduct their discussion more systematically. To Jung’s great astonishment Freud proceeded to group the contents of the harangue under several precise headings that enabled them to spend the further hours in a more profitable give and take. (Jones, 1955: 36)</p>
                <p>Their mutual admiration after this first meeting was unbounded and Jung declared that Freud was handsome and asked his wife to send him - Jung - a photograph of Freud. To continue with Jones’s account, Jung regarded this meeting as the high point of his life (confirmed by Bennet) and said that: ‘whoever had acquired a knowledge of psychoanalysis had eaten of the tree of Paradise and attained vision’ (Jones, 1955: 37).</p>
                <p>Freud, for his part, was equally inspired and grateful to have the support of an aryan as he wanted psychoanalysis to be opened up to the non-Jewish world. He claimed that Jung was one of the only two original minds among his followers.</p>
                <p>He soon decided that Jung was to be his successor and at times called him his ‘son and heir’ . . . Jung was to be the Joshua destined to explore the promised land of psychiatry which Freud, like Moses, was only permitted to view from afar. Incidentally, this remark is of interest as indicating Freud’s self-identification with Moses, one which in later years became very evident. (Jones, 1955: 37)</p>
                <p>There are strong undertones of an idealized father/son transference and countertransference in which both men appear to have been swept up at the moment of their first meeting.</p>
                <p>Freud and Jung were to come together on nine or ten further occasions, including four Congresses and the journey to America together, but the freshness of the first meeting could never be experienced again. The last time they saw each other was at the Munich Congress in September, 1913. (Jones, 1955: 38)</p>
                <p>Two years later they met again in Vienna and were talking of the psychoanalytic movement in Freud’s study. According to the account Jung gave Bennet of this encounter he was for the first time finding Freud unyielding and their association almost impossible. During this discussion, they were both startled to hear a formidable crash as if the bookcase in the room was about to fall down. Jung said, ‘It will happen again,’—at which point it did. When they both examined the bookcase they could find nothing. This event represented for Jung a parapsychological phenomenon. He says that he tried to discuss it with Freud as a synchronistic event, that is one not explainable by cause and effect, which might augur a split between the two of them. However, Freud refused to take it seriously and dismissed the whole matter.</p>
                <p>Jones’s account of this affair is again somewhat different:</p>
                <p>On one of his first visits to Vienna on March 25, 1909, he (Jung) regaled Freud one evening with astonishing stories of his experiences, and also displayed his powers as a poltergeist by making various articles in the room rattle on the furniture. (Jones, 1957: 411)</p>
                <p>However, Jung, Freud and Jones are in agreement in being unimpressed by the followers that Freud surrounded himself with in Vienna.</p>
                <p>Jung had told me in Zurich what a pity it was that Freud had no followers of any weight in Vienna, and that he was surrounded there by a ‘degenerate and Bohemian crowd’ who did him little credit. (Jones, 1959: 169-70)</p>
                <p>The reader may perhaps gather that I was not highly impressed with the assembly. It seemed an unworthy accompaniment to Freud’s genius, but in the Vienna of those days, so full of prejudice against him, it was hard to secure a pupil with a reputation to lose, so he had to take what he could get. (Jones, 1959: 169-70)</p>
                <p>I [Freud] no longer get any pleasure from the Viennese. I have a heavy cross to bear with the older generation, Stekel, Adler, Sadger. (Jones, 1955: 78)</p>
                <p>Jones did, however, impute the antagonism between Jung and the Vienna Group to the former’s anti-Semitic streak. John Kerr in his book <em>A Most Dangerous Method</em>, named after a saying by William James with regard to psychoanalysis, says that this charge is unfair:</p>
                <p>At the time of his first visit, Jung was still in the grip of what can best be described as his Jewish romance. He was positively attracted by the Jewishness of psychoanalysis . . . Having early abandoned Swiss Calvinism, the faith he was raised in, Jung was without a church of his own; for him Judaism, like occultism, was an intriguing church next door. (Kerr, 1994: 133)</p>
                <p>Freud came to rely on Jung increasingly and made him the editor of the <em>The Yearbook for Psychoanalytic and Psych op athological Researches</em>, which had its first edition in 1909. At the second Psychoanalytic Congress held at Nuremberg in 1910, the International Psychoanalytic Association (IPA) was founded and Freud’s initial idea was to appoint Jung as the president in perpetuity, with complete power to appoint and remove analysts. Wittels’s biography of Freud gives a glimpse of how the Viennese analysts reacted to this, for instance, Alfred Adler and Wilhelm Stekel were utterly dismayed as it meant that from then on analysts would have to submit their scientific writings to Jung for approval before publication (Wittels, 1934). Further, the future development of psychoanalysis would lie in Jung’s and not Freud’s hands.</p>
                <p>The Viennese analysts held a private meeting in the Grand Hotel at Nuremberg to discuss the new situation and Freud made an unexpected appearance. He burst into an excited speech, as follows:</p>
                <p>Most of you are Jews, and therefore you are incompetent to win friends for the new teaching. Jews must be content with the modest role of preparing the ground. It is absolutely essential that I should form ties in the world of general science. I am getting on in years, and am weary of being perpetually attacked. We are all in danger. [Seizing his coat by the lapels, he said:] They won’t even leave me a coat on my back. The Swiss will save us - will save me, and all of you as well. (Wittels, 1934: 12)</p>
                <p>The furore all this caused, particularly amongst the Viennese analysts, resulted in a modification of the original proposals. Jung was made president for two years and the official seat of the IPA was to be in Zurich for the duration of his presidency. Alfred Adler was made president of the Vienna Society. The organizational birth of the psychoanalytical movement was fraught with difficulties on all sides and even Bleuler refused to join. By August 1910, Freud had expressed doubts but was reassured by Jung in such a heartening way that the founding of the IPA had one positive outcome:</p>
                <p>that of reconciling them to each other after the tensions engendered by the American trip described below.</p>

                </header>
                <p>According to Jung, the year 1909 proved to be a decisive one for his relationship with Freud. The two had been invited to lecture at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts and they decided to travel together with Sandor Ferenczi accompanying them. They met up in Bremen and, according to Jung’s account, this was where the famous fainting fit of Freud’s occurred. It was provoked by a discussion on the prehistoric ‘peat-bog corpses’ which are to be found in northern Germany. Jung seems to have discussed these on several occasions, including once at the dinner table during which Freud became agitated and suddenly fainted. Later, he interpreted Jung’s fascination with corpses as a death-wish against himself.</p>
                <p>Freud fainted another time in Jung’s presence during the Psychoanalytic Congress in Munich in 1912. This time the discussion centred on the monotheistic Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, Akhenaten. Jung disputed strongly against those who interpreted Akhenaten’s monotheism as a personal resistance to his father because he had obliterated his father’s names from statues. At this point, Freud slid off his chair in a faint and Jung picked him up and carried him to a sofa in the next room. Jung attributes both instances of fainting to Freud’s fantasy of father-murder.</p>
                <p>Jung says that though Freud made frequent allusions to him as his successor, he himself was not greatly enamoured of the idea as he had no real desire to be the leader of the movement. He declares that it was not in his nature to be that and that he felt it would mean sacrificing his intellectual independence. We will revisit this point later and, in the meantime, let us return to the visit to America.</p>
                <p>Jung and Freud spent seven weeks in the USA where they were together every day. As a result, they took to analysing each other’s dreams but something occurred one day which ‘proved to be a severe blow to the whole relationship’ (Jung, 1963b: 181). Freud had a dream which Jung interpreted and then asked for more information about the former’s private life in order to interpret it in more depth. Jung reports that Freud’s response was to look at him with suspicion and say: ‘But I cannot risk my authority’ (Jung, 1963b: 182). At this point Jung says that in his eyes Freud lost his authority for placing himself above truth.</p>
                <p>It was during the American trip that Jung had a dream that was to give him the first intimation of his theory of the collective unconscious. It went as follows:</p>
                <p>I was in a house I did not know, which had two storeys. It was ‘my house’. I found myself in the upper storey, where there was a kind of salon furnished with fine old pieces in rococo style. On the walls hung a number of precious old paintings. I wondered that this should be my house, and thought, ‘Not bad’. But then it occurred to me that I did not know what the lower floor looked like. Descending the stairs, I reached the ground floor. There everything was much older, and I realized that this part of the house must date from about the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The furnishings were medieval; the floors were of red brick.</p>
                <p>Everywhere it was rather dark. I went from one room to another, thinking, ‘Now I really must explore the whole house’. I came upon a heavy door, and opened it. Beyond it, I discovered a stone stairway that led down into the cellar. Descending again, I found myself in a beautifully vaulted room which looked exceedingly ancient. Examining the walls, I discovered layers of brick among the ordinary stone blocks, and chips of brick in the mortar. As soon as I saw this I knew that the walls dated from Roman times. My interest by now was intense. I looked more closely at the floor. It was on stone slabs, and in one of these I discovered a ring. When I pulled it, the stone slab lifted, and again I saw a stairway of narrow stone steps leading down into the depths. These, too, I descended, and entered a low cave cut into the rock. Thick dust lay on the floor, and in the dust were scattered bones and broken pottery, like remains of a primitive culture. I discovered two human skulls, obviously very old and half disintegrated. (Jung, 1963b: 183)</p>
                <p>Jung told this dream to Freud, who returned repeatedly to the theme of the skulls, asking for Jung’s associations with them. Jung says that he knew that Freud was thinking again of death-wishes against himself so, in order to deflect this, Jung lied and said that he associated them with his wife and sister-in-law.</p>
                <p>Jung’s own interpretation of the dream was that it represented an image of the psyche: the first floor standing for his conscious state; the ground floor for the first level of unconsciousness and so on. He saw the cave as representing the most primitive layer of psyche bordering on the animal soul. For Jung, the dream contained the history of successive layers of consciousness.</p>
                <p>It was these kinds of incidents that started to show up the growing rift between Freud and Jung and the strain engendered by the unknown that the USA represented added to their tensions. A.A. Brill met them in New York and took them on expeditions to Chinatown and Central Park. From New York, Freud, Jung, Ferenczi and Brill went to Worcester for the Congress. Their host was Stanley Hall, who had been William James’s star pupil at Harvard in the study of physiological psychology. Ernest Jones was also there bringing with him James Jackson Putnam, holder of the first American Chair in neurology at Harvard. Freud and Jung had a huge success at the Congress and their American audiences were enormously interested to hear more about psychoanalysis and the experiments with complexes. Freud’s conflict theory—’libido’ versus ‘repression’ - was seen as shedding much-needed light in explaining Janet’s constitutional theory of hereditary weakness combined with moral degeneration as progenitors of hysterical symptoms.</p>
                <p>Both Freud and Jung were gratified at the adulation with which such sophisticated audiences greeted their lectures and they were awarded honorary degrees at the end of the Congress. William James remained sceptical saying:</p>
                <p>I confess that he (Freud) made on me personally the impression of a man obsessed with fixed ideas. I can make nothing in my own case with his dream theories, and obviously ‘symbolism’ is a most dangerous method. (Kerr, 1994: 245)</p>

                </header>
                <p>The best witness to the nature of the collaboration between Freud and Jung is the lengthy correspondence between them from the years 1906 to 1913. The first actual letter was written by Freud on 11 April 1906, warmly acknowledging a volume sent to him by Jung. Their letters to each other remained unpublished until after the death of both men and as late as 1959, two years before Jung’s death, he was interviewed by John Freeman for the BBC as follows:</p>
                <p><em>Freeman</em>: When are the letters which you exchanged with Freud going to be published?</p>
                <p><em>Jung</em>: Well, not during my lifetime.</p>
                <p><em>Freeman</em>: You would have no objection to their being published after your lifetime?</p>
                <p><em>Jung</em>: Oh, no, none at all.</p>
                <p><em>Freeman</em>: Because they are probably of great historical importance.</p>
                <p><em>Jung</em>: I don’t think so.</p>
                <p><em>Freeman</em>: Then why have you not published them so far?</p>
                <p><em>Jung</em>: Because they were not important enough. I see no particular importance in them. (Maguire, 1974: xxx)</p>
                <p>However, shortly after this Jung wrote to a pupil he had asked to go through his correspondence with Freud:</p>
                <p>Best thanks for the quotation from that accursed correspondence. For me it is an unfortunately inexpungeable reminder of the incredible folly that filled the days of my youth. The journey from cloud-cuckoo-land back to reality lasted a long time. In my case Pilgrim’s Progress consisted in my having to climb down a thousand ladders until I could reach out my hand to the little clod of earth that I am. (Maguire, 1974: xxx)</p>
                <p>There was a great deal of negotiation before agreement w a s reached between the Freud and Jung families to publish. Finally, on 25 February 1970, Jung’s son, Franz, flew from Zürich to London with the original Freud letters to meet with Freud’s son, Ernst, at the latter’s home in St. John’s Wood. The two got on well and had much in common as they were both architects.</p>
                <p>A cross-section of the correspondence will be reproduced below to illustrate key moments of the interaction between the two men. Freud started off by addressing Jung as ‘Dear Colleague’ which changed to ‘Dear Friend’, while Jung out of deference as the much younger of the two addressed Freud always as ‘Dear Professor Freud’. Even as early as 1906, Jung is writing of his doubts of the sexual aetiology of all neuroses, as follows.</p>
                <p>Jung (23 October 1906):</p>
                <p>It is possible that my reservations . . . are due to lack of experience. But don’t you think that a number of borderline phenomena might be considered more appropriately in terms of the other basic drive, <em>hunger</em>: for instance, eating, sucking (predominantly hunger), kissing (predominantly desexuality)? Two complexes existing at the same time are always bound to coalesce psychologically, so that one of them invariably contains constellated aspects of the other. (Maguire, 1974: 7)</p>
                <p>Jung (24 May 1907):</p>
                <p>Your <em>Gravida</em> is magnificent. I gulped it at one go . . . Often I have to transport myself back to the time before the reformation of my psychological thinking to re-experience the charges that were laid against you. I simply can’t understand them any more . . . So you may be absolutely right when you seek the cause of our opponents’ resistance in affects, especially sexual affects. (Maguire, 1974: 49)</p>
                <p>Freud (6 June 1907):</p>
                <p>I am very much surprised to hear that I am the rich man from whose table you glean a few crumbs. (Maguire, 1974: 58)</p>
                <p>Jung (19 August 1907):</p>
                <p>Do you regard sexuality as the mother of all feelings? Isn’t sexuality for you merely one component of the personality (albeit the most important) . . . Are there not hysterical symptoms which, though co-determined by the sexual complex, are predominantly conditioned by a sublimation or by a non-sexual complex (profession, job, etc)? (Maguire, 1974: 79)</p>
                <p>Freud (27 August 1907):</p>
                <p>For the present I do not believe that anyone is justified in saying that sexuality is the mother of all feelings . . . I regard (for the present) the role of sexual complexes in hysteria merely as a theoretical necessity. (Maguire, 1974: 80)</p>
                <p>Jung (28 October 1907):</p>
                <p>Actually - and I confess this to you with a struggle—I have a boundless admiration for you both as a man and a researcher, and I bear you no conscious grudge. So the self-preservation complex does not come from there; it is rather that my veneration for you has something of the character of a ‘religious’ crush. Though it does not really bother me, I still feel it is disgusting and ridiculous because of its undeniable erotic undertone. This abominable feeling comes from the fact that as a boy I was the victim of a sexual assault by a man I once worshipped. (Maguire, 1974: 95)</p>
                <p>Freud (2 January 1910):</p>
                <p>It has occurred to me that the ultimate basis of man’s need for religion is <em>infantile helplessness</em>, which is so much greater in man than in animals. After infancy he cannot conceive of a world without parents and makes for himself a just God and a kindly nature, the two worst anthropomorphic falsifications. (Maguire, 1974: 284)</p>
                <p>Freud (3 March 1911):</p>
                <p>Since the day before yesterday I have been the chairman of the Vienna group. It had become impossible to go on with Adler; he was quite aware of it himself and admitted that his chairmanship was incompatible with his new theories. Stekel, who now sees eye to eye with him, followed suit . . . I now feel that I must avenge the offended goddess Libido . . . I see now that Adler’s seeming decisiveness concealed a good deal of confusion. I would never have expected a psychoanalyst to be so taken in by the ego. (Maguire, 1974: 400)</p>
                <p>Freud (5 March 1912):</p>
                <p>I have pointed out to you that the Association cannot prosper when the president loses interest in it over a period of months, especially when he has so unreliable an assistant as our friend Riklin. You seem to recognize that I am right . . . You make it clear to me that you don’t wish to write to me at present, and I reply that I am trying to make the privation easy for myself . . . You speak of the need for intellectual independence and quote Nietzsche in support of your view . . . But if a third party were to read this passage, he would ask me when I had tried to tyrannize you intellectually, and I should have to say: I don’t know. (Maguire, 1974: 492)</p>
                <p>Jung (2 August 1912):</p>
                <p>In certain circumstances, indeed as a general rule, the fantasy object is <em>called</em> ‘mother’. But it seems to me highly unlikely that primitive man ever passed through an era of incest. Rather, it would appear that the first manifestation of incestuous desire was the prohibition itself. (Maguire, 1974: 512)</p>
                <p>Jung (3 December 1912):</p>
                <p>Our analysis, you may remember, came to a stop with your remark that you ‘could not submit to analysis <em>without losing your authority</em>.’ These words are engraved on my memory as a symbol of everything to come. (Maguire, 1974: 526)</p>
                <p>Freud (5 December 1912):</p>
                <p>For the present I can only suggest a household remedy: let each of us pay more attention to his own than to his neighbour’s neurosis. (Maguire, 1974: 529)</p>
                <p>Jung (18 December 1912):</p>
                <p>I would, however, point out that your technique of treating your pupils like patients is a <em>blunder</em>. In that way you produce either slavish sons or impudent puppies . . . You go around sniffing out all the symptomatic actions in your vicinity, thus reducing everyone to the level of sons and daughters who blushingly admit the existence of their faults. Meanwhile you remain on top as the father, sitting pretty. (Maguire, 1974: 535)</p>
                <p>Freud (3 January 1913):</p>
                <p>It is a convention among us analysts that none of us need feel ashamed of his own bit of neurosis. But one who while behaving abnormally keeps shouting that he is normal gives ground for the suspicion that he lacks insight into his illness. Accordingly, I propose that we abandon our personal relations entirely. (Maguire, 1974: 539)</p>
                <p>Jung (6 January 1913):</p>
                <p>I accede to your wish that we abandon our personal relations, for I never thrust my friendship on anyone. You yourself are the best judge of what this moment means to you. ‘The rest is silence’. (Maguire, 1974: 540)</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Break with Freud</h3>
                </header>
                <p>There is an archetypal, even tragic, feel to the decline of the relationship that existed for a few years between Freud and Jung. The last time the two actually met was in September 1913 in Munich at the fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress. Jung was again put forward as president of the IPÄ and Freud’s close followers, Abraham, Ferenczi, Jones, Rank amongst them, handed in 2 2 blank ballot papers. However, 52 analysts voted in favour of Jung so he was reinstated in office. Over the following months there was consternation in the Freudian camp about Jung’s continuing role in the IPA and as editor of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yearbook</em> but on 29 October of that year he stood down as editor followed in April 1914 by his resignation as president of the IPA.</p>
                <p>Jung and Bennet, in their written accounts of what led to the final rupture, cite Jung’s book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious</em>, published in 1916. The title was later changed to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>, as Volume 5 of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em>. While Jung was working on this book he had dreams that presaged the break with Freud but as he says in the Foreword to the fourth Swiss edition:</p>
                <p>The whole thing came upon me like a landslide that cannot be stopped . . . it was the explosion of all those psychic contents which could find no room, no breathing-space, in the constricting atmosphere of Freudian psychology and its narrow outlook. (Jung, 1956: xxiii)</p>
                <p>In this work, Jung put forward his own view of libido and incest which portrayed them as having a spiritual meaning:</p>
                <p>Sexuality is of the greatest importance as the expression of the chthonic spirit. That spirit is the ‘other face of God’, the dark side of the Godimage. The question of the chthonic spirit has occupied me ever since I began to delve into the world of alchemy. Basically, this interest was awakened by that early conversation with Freud, when, mystified, I felt how deeply stirred he was by the phenomenon of sexuality. (Jung, 1963: 192)</p>
                <p>Paul Stepansky, in his paper, ‘The Empiricist as Rebel: Jung, Freud and the Burdens of Discipleship’, takes a very different view of both the book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>, and of the final cause of the parting of the ways between Jung and Freud. H e starts with a close scrutiny of the supposed controversial parts of the book and concludes that these could in no way have given cause for the contentious split between the two men. The move away from a narrow formulation of the libido concept was instigated by Freud himself in his analysis of paranoia in the Schreber case history. Jung himself stated that Freud here demonstrates that the paranoiac’s longing for the reality principle cannot be traced to the withdrawal of libido alone. ‘Freud as well as myself, saw the need of widening this conception of libido’ (Stepansky, 1992: 177).</p>
                <p>Stepansky also points to Freud as the original source of Jung’s exploration of the collective unconscious as the realm of mythmaking and symbolism, for instance, in his study of Leonardo da Vinci. After reading this, Jung wrote to him in 1910:</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Leonardo</em> is wonderful. The transition to mythology grows out of this essay from inner necessity, actually it is the first essay of yours with whose inner development I felt perfectly in tune from the start. (Maguire, 1974: 329)</p>
                <p>Stepansky further suggests that: ‘However extensive the classical and philological themes contained in the Miller fantasies, Miss Miller’s “vision of creation” remains first and foremost a function of an “erotic impression”; the source of her symbolical productions is “an erotic conflict’” (Stepansky, 1992: 176).</p>
                <p>Most significantly of all, he points out that in the chapter on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbolism of the Mother and Rebirth</em>, Jung’s hypothesis that incestuous desire signifies the wish to return to the mother in order to be re-born is similar in kind to Freud’s concept of ‘primal narcissism’. As early as 1910, the latter had given his blessing to an early draft of the work.</p>
                <p>Stepansky’s aim in revising this account of the Freud/Jung split is to pave the way for his own hypothesis about what took place. He questions why Freud, for whom the sexual aetiology of neuroses was the central tenet of psychoanalysis, would have named ‘as his heir apparent a disciple whose ruthless empiricism undercut the social and clinical crusade that was already under way?’ (Stepansky, 1992: 187).</p>
                <p>In a letter of 1908 responding to his Berlin disciple, Karl Abraham, Freud tries to assuage the former’s qualms over Jung’s silence on the sexual theory. Freud says that it is easier for Abraham to accept this as they are racial kinsmen while Jung ‘as a Christian and a pastor’s son finds his way to me only against great inner resistance. His association with us is the more valuable for that analysis escaped the danger of becoming a Jewish national affair’ (Stepansky, 1992: 191).</p>
                <p>Freud also pinned his hopes on Jung to take his work further in applying it to the psychoses as well as the neuroses. For these reasons:</p>
                <p>Freud . . . consciously deceived Jung in allowing him to believe his conditional appropriation of dream mechanics and energetics constituted full-fledged loyalty to the movement . . . The entire episode . . . is a long and ominous testimony to Freud’s emotional investment in the institutionalized movement his work had created. (Stepansky, 1992: 192)</p>
                <p>Freud’s view of the rupture is different to this as he demonstrates in a scathing attack on Jung and what he terms the ‘Neo-Zurich’ school in his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On the History of the Psycho-Analytic Movement</em>. As he says there about them:</p>
                <p>Suppose - to make use of a simile—that in a particular social group there lives a <em>parvenu</em>, who boasts of being descended from a noble family living in another place. It is pointed out to him, however, that his parents live somewhere in the neighborhood, and that they are quite humble people. There is only one way of escape from his difficulty and he seizes on it. He can no longer repudiate his parents, but he asserts that they themselves are of noble lineage and have merely come down in the world; and he procures a family-tree from some obliging official source. It seems to me that the Swiss have been obliged to behave in much the same way . . . (i)f ethics and religion were not allowed to be sexualized but had to be something ‘higher’ from the start, and if nevertheless the ideas contained in them seemed undeniably to be descended from the Oedipus and family-complex . . . (Freud, 1966: 73)</p>
                <p>Freud makes it clear that, as far as he is concerned, Jung’s modification of the sexual theory represented both an abandonment of psychoanalysis and a secession from it. This was formalized in the UK when the British Medical Association (BMA) set up a committee that included Ernest Jones to investigate psychoanalysis. The BMA Report of 1928 defined psychoanalysis as ‘the technique devised by Freud, who first used the term, and the theory which he has built upon his work’ (King and Steiner, 1991: 12). The Report went on to recognize the distinction between ‘psychoanalysts’ and ‘pseudoanalysts’. In this way, Jones enabled psychoanalysts to differentiate themselves from other forms of psychotherapeutic practice and to be treated like any other form of specialism in medicine.</p>
                <p>This was the first time an official national body of the medical profession from any country had recognized the distinction between ‘psychoanalysts’ and ‘pseudo-analysts’, as well as the qualifications established by membership of the International Psychoanalytical Association. (King and Steiner, 1991: 13)</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Aftermath</h3>
                </header>
                <p>The professional aftermath of the rupture between Freud and Jung was as follows. Zurich up to this point had been the second most important centre of psychoanalysis after Vienna. There was a flourishing Psychoanalytical Association which was initially attached to both the Burghölzli Hospital and the University of Zurich. In 1912 this separated f r om the Burghölzli and became an independent institution in its own right. In 1914, after Freud published his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On the History of the Psychoanalytic Movement</em>, the Zurich Psychoanalytical Association voted to leave the International Psychoanalytic Association. This group consisted mainly of medical doctors that met regularly until 1918 when it became absorbed into the newly formed Analytical Psychology Club.</p>
                <p>The emotional impact of the rupture on both men was profound and Jung suffered from what Ellenberger calls a ‘creative illness’ for a few years after the break with Freud. The background to the relationship with Freud, including the final denouement, is illuminated by the Jungian analyst, Murray Stein, in his study of Jung’s problematic relationship to both his personal father and to what might be called the archetypal Father in the form of Christianity. Stein’s account of Jung’s childhood shows the latter’s growing awareness of the ailments of Christianity and of his father’s resultant withered attitude to spiritual life. As has already been mentioned, Jung senior was a pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church but, in spite of this, he was unable to help his son with his own doubts about Christian theology and doctrine. Jung was left feeling that neither was able to struggle with the great spiritual issues of the day.</p>
                <p>Stein’s convincing argument is that Jung saw his spiritual vocation as the path to healing the source of his father’s suffering. In this way, Jung’s attitude to Christianity was akin to a patient who needed ‘treatment’. (Casement, 1998: 73)</p>
                <p>The main thrust of Stein’s thesis is that Jung experienced his father as being content to go along with a conventional view of the allgood Christian God with the consequence that he never had the courage to experience God’s dark or shadow side. ‘This made his religion shallow . . . and in the end, Jung felt, “faith broke faith with him’” (Stein, 1985: 74).</p>
                <p>The encounter with Freud was to a greater or lesser extent fuelled by a wish-fulfilment for the idealized father, one who had the courage to face the dark side of life. As the idealization began to break down and Jung experienced Freud as one-sided and dogmatic, his father complex resurfaced with renewed energy as he tried to ‘redeem’ Freud from the error of his ways. Michael Fordham, the eminent English Jungian analyst, in the account he wrote of his own life, describes his last meeting with Jung shortly before the latter’s death in 1961. Jung had written a letter to an English colleague saying that he had failed in his mission and was misunderstood and misrepresented. Fordham visited him in an effort to ease his distress but ends by saying: ‘When I came to see him I did not touch on these matters but spoke superficially. If I had not done that I would have had to convey my thought that it was the delusion of being a world saviour that made him feel a failure’ (Fordham, 1993: 120).</p>
                <p>All of which helps to explain the strength of feeling he expresses in the final written communications with Freud and in subsequent publications. In 1958 he published <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em>, his own account of the confrontation between the Hebrew God, Yahweh and his disciple, Job. For Jung, Yahweh is a being consumed with his own omniscience and omnipotence and finally has to acknowledge the superior integrity of Job, who manages to remain true to his own faith in the face of Yahweh’s onslaughts. The following quote is ostensibly written about the latter but it could equally apply to Freud:</p>
                <p>With his touchiness and suspiciousness the mere possibility of doubt was enough to infuriate him and induce that peculiar double-faced behaviour of which he had already given proof in the Garden of Eden, when he pointed out the tree to the First Parents and at the same time forbade them to eat of it. In this way he precipitated the Fall, which he apparently never intended. (Jung, 1958: 13)</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Creative Illness</h3>
                </header>
                <p>From 1913 until 1918 Jung experienced what he called a period of confrontation with the unconscious when he had apocalyptic dreams and visions.</p>
                <p>After the parting of the ways with Freud, a period of inner uncertainty began for me. It would be no exaggeration to call it a state of disorientation. I felt totally suspended in mid-air, for I had not yet found my own footing. (Jung, 1963b: 194)</p>
                <p>I lived as if under constant inner pressure. At times this became so strong that I suspected there was some psychic disturbance in myself. (Jung, 1963b: 197)</p>
                <p>He felt the need to return to childhood and began to play childish games building houses and villages with stones. He found that this contact with stone helped to connect him to his fantasies and creativity. In the autumn of 1913 he had an overpowering vision in the course of which he s aw a monstrous flood covering the northern and low-lying lands between the North Sea and the Alps. As it approached Switzerland, the mountains grew higher to protect the country from the mighty yellow waves in which floated the rubble of civilizations and the bodies of thousands of people. Then the whole sea turned to blood. At the time he thought that this indicated that he was menaced by an approaching psychosis and did not think of war at all.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 1913 he had the following dream:</p>
                <p>I was with an unknown, brown-skinned man, a savage, in a lonely, rocky mountain landscape. It was before dawn; the eastern sky was already bright, and the stars fading. Then I heard Siegfried’s horn sounding over the mountains and I knew that we had to kill him. We were armed with rifles and lay in wait for him on a narrow path over the rocks. Then Siegfried appeared high up on the crest of the mountain, in the first ray of the rising sun. On a chariot made of the bones of the dead he drove at a furious speed down the precipitous slope. When he turned a corner, we shot at him, and he plunged down, struck dead. (Jung, 1963b: 204) Jung pondered for a long time on this dream before its meaning began to dawn. His initial reaction had been remorse and disgust that he had killed something so great and beautiful. Then he realized that Siegfried represented the Teutonic wish to impose their will heroically on the world. This had also been true of himself but he began to see that that was no longer what suited him and that the heroic attitude that Siegfried personified had to be ‘killed’.</p>
                <p>In abandoning the heroic attitude which may also be equated with consciousness, Jung let himself experience the depths of the psyche, in the course of which he encountered many figures that impressed him and made him realize that there were things in his psyche that he did not produce but which had a life of their own. One such personification he named Philemon, a wise-old-man figure. It was from Philemon that Jung learned about the <em>objective psyche</em> which is different from the personal unconscious. He also represented for Jung superior insight and became almost like a living personality with whom Jung would walk in the garden.</p>
                <p>It is, of course, ironical that I, a psychiatrist, should at almost every step of my experiment have run into the same psychic material which is the stuff of psychosis and is found in the insane. This is the fund of unconscious images which fatally confuse the mental patient. But it is also the matrix of a mythopoeic imagination which has vanished from our rational age. (Jung, 1963b: 213)</p>
                <p>What Jung also encountered in the years 1916 - 18 was what he came to see as the bedrock of psychological wholeness, that which both keeps the psyche from falling apart at times of great stress but also transcends and goes beyond the psyche. He termed this the <em>‘self’</em>, which he began to express in circular drawings or mandalas. As a result of this, he realized that the goal of psychic development is the self and that this comes about as a result of the circumnamulation of the self that lies at the centre of the individual. This will be elaborated later in the book.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Women in Jung’s Life</h3>
                </header>
                <p>What Jung claims kept him sane at the time of his ‘creative illness’ was his family and his work. He first s aw his future wife, Emma Rauschenbach, when he was 21 and she was 14. She came from an affluent family of watchmakers whose lifestyle contrasted greatly with Jung’s impoverished background. They met again when he was 2 7 and she 20, were married in 1903 and had four daughters and a son over the next few years. Their first married home was a flat above Eugen Bleuler and his wife at the Burghölzli Hospital. In the meantime, a house was being built for them at Küsnacht, a village on the side of the lake at Zurich.</p>
                <p>The marriage lasted for 52 years until Emma’s death in 1955 by which he was deeply moved, telling Michael Fordham at the funeral that she was a queen. There is no doubt that Emma Jung was the most important woman in Jung’s life. She had a mind of her own as well as being psychologically minded and, unlike Jung, she was interested in the personal lives of individual patients and their environment. Although she wrote little in her own right, Emma contributed more than any of the other women in Jung’s life to his ideas, for instance, in giving the <em>animus</em> the positive aspect as a woman’s logos that it lacked before.</p>
                <p>Despite his own happy marriage, Jung appears to have had little respect for the conventions of marriage and parenthood, as shown by a remark of his that is on record made at a meeting in Vienna 1931: ‘There are few things which have caused as much anxiety, unhappiness, and evil as the compulsion to give birth’ (Adler, 1976: 15). Emma Jung feared that her pregnancies would turn Jung away from her.</p>
                <p>For his part, Jung wrote a paper on marriage in 1925 called ‘Marriage as a Psychological Relationship’, in which he talked about one partner in the relationship being the ‘container’ and the other the ‘contained’. By this he meant that the contained - that is, the simpler personality - finds everything they need within the marriage, whilst the container - the more complex one - becomes increasingly frustrated and seeks fulfilment elsewhere. If this remains unresolved between the two it can lead either to the breakdown of the marital relationship or to an increasingly collusive state of affairs.</p>
                <p>On the whole, Jung’s written accounts of external marriage are tinged with a negative aspect and he always expressed a bias in favour of individual development versus the mutual understanding that may come out of the marital relationship. This balance was redressed by the Jungian analyst, Guggenbühl-Craig, who wrote in 1977 an account called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marriage—Dead or Alive?</em>, of how people can develop as individuals within the kind of marriage that serves the deepest interests of both.</p>
                <p>For Jung, it was the higher marriage or <em>hierosgamos</em> signifying an internal connection that fascinated him. This was represented by the archetypal union in the rebirth mysteries of antiquity, in the symbolic marriage of Christ and the Church and in the alchemical conjunction of sun and moon. The higher or sacred marriage may lead to the birth of the divine child. This will be elaborated in a later chapter on the alchemical container of analysis and the symbolic ‘marriage’ of analyst and analysand.</p>
                <p>Jung’s attitude to women appears to have been ambivalent. On the one hand, he seems to have needed an anima figure or <em>femme inspiratrice</em> with whom to have ‘poetry’. However, he also called them ‘animus hounds’ a particularly damning expression he used for any woman that he found opinionated or overpowering.</p>
                <p>There was also the group of women analysts and colleagues who were gathered around Jung in Zurich, some of whom remained unmarried and instead devoted their lives to working with his ideas. The most prominent amongst these were Marie-Louise von Franz, the daughter of an Austrian nobleman, and Barbara Hannah, the Dean of Chichester’s daughter. The Jungian analyst, Thomas Kirsch, the son of a close collaborator of Jung’s, James Kirsch, has written a book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Jungians</em>, chronicling the development of the Jungian world. In this he states that von Franz was the person who carried on Jung’s legacy and that her position to Jung may be compared to Anna Freud’s to Freud.</p>
                <p>Another woman devotee of Jung’s was Yolande Jacobi, a Hungarian Jewess married to a prominent lawyer, who managed to escape from Vienna after the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Anschluss</em>—the union of the Austrian Republic and the German Reich in 1938. All three of these women were prolific writers.</p>
                <p>Jung visited the USA again in 1912, this time without Freud. In the course of this visit, he associated with some of the wealthiest American families and became acquainted with Edith Rockefeller, the daughter of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil Trust. She married Harold Fowler McCormick, another wealthy American. Edith McCormick suffered from agoraphobia and she offered to set Jung up in practice in the USA in order that he could treat her. Instead, he suggested she come to Zurich, which she did in 1913. It was the McCormick money that funded the first Psychological Club in Zurich. This was the prototype of many Analytical Psychology Clubs that flowered in other parts of the world that preceded the formal establishment of training institutes.</p>
                <p>Another key woman in this context was Aniela Jaffe, mentioned above as the co-author with Jung of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>. She started analysis with him in 1937, became the secretary of the Jung Institute in Zurich in 1947 and subsequently Jung’s own secretary.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Femmes Inspiratrices</h3>
                </header>
                <p>There was a line of inspiring women in Jung’s life, starting with his cousin, Helene Preiswerk, who had mediumistic gifts and to whom he dedicated his doctoral thesis.</p>
                <p>Another was Frank Miller, an American patient of the Swiss—French psychiatrist, Theodore Flournoy. Sonu Shamdasani says of her: ‘A feminine icon stands at the head of Jung’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>, presiding over the birth of Analytical Psychology’ (Shamdasani, 1990: 26). This is the book that has been cited as leading to the final rupture with Freud in 1913. The main theme of the book is the heroic struggle for deliverance from the Mother so that the individual who achieves autonomy is the one who is born twice - once physically and the second time symbolically.</p>
                <p>Frank Miller, like Jung, was given to mythological fantasies and this is what struck a deep chord in him when he read the case history that Flournoy sent him. It released in Jung the fantasies that he felt had been bottled up during the years with Freud.</p>
                <p>The material that Miller produced was in the form of fantasies and active imagination rather than having its origins in childhood and this was to become Jung’s own approach. It led him to conceptualize that there are two forms of thinking: directed and fantasy. The former he viewed as culturally formed by education, which transformed it from the subjective, individual sphere to the objective, social sphere. The second was effortless and spontaneous and guided by unconscious motives. This was a crucial landmark in Jung’s development and everything he wrote since that time was informed by this duality.</p>
                <p>In his paper on Frank Miller, Shamdasani also points to the enormous impact Flournoy had on Jung’s work, which he claims was at least as great as Freud’s. Some of these influences include the autonomy of the psyche; teleology based on Aristotle’s doctrine of final causes; the compensatory nature of the unconscious and synchronicity. In his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">From India to the Planet Mars</em>, Flournoy showed ‘the ancestral and extraterrestrial existences of his medium, who he dubbed Helene Smith, to be the work of the subconscious creative imagination fueled by cryptomnesias’ (Shamdasani, 1990: 39).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sabina Spielrein</em></p>
                <p>Another inspiring woman in Jung’s life was the young Russian Jewess, Sabina Spielrein. She was admitted as an inpatient to the Burghölzli in August 1904 diagnosed as suffering from psychotic hysteria and became Jung’s first psychoanalytic patient. He treated her intensively with this method for two months, using Janet’s method of sitting behind the patient. Her presenting symptom was that she oscillated between masturbating and bouts of self-disgust; this appeared to be associated to fantasies of being beaten by her father which produced in her erotic feelings followed by a sense of disgust with herself.</p>
                <p>Jung quickly became aware that she was unusually bright and treated her both psychoanalytically as well as didactically, giving her his doctoral dissertation to read. In 1905, she was well enough to enrol as a medical student at the University of Zurich. There are two accounts of this lengthy relationship, which later included Freud, to whom Jung turned for help when he felt out of his depth. The first account was written in 1984 by the Jungian analyst, Aldo Carotenuto, which maintains a neutral position on whether Jung and Spielrein actually had a physical affair (Carotenuto, 1984). She certainly seemed to want a soulful union with Jung, which would give birth to a creative idea that she conceptualized as a symbolic son (whom she called ‘Siegfried’).</p>
                <p>The other, later account by John Kerr, the American clinical psychologist and historian, is entitled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Most Dangerous Method</em>. Kerr is in no doubt that the two consummated their love in an erotic relationship but he also rehabilitates Spielrein as a significant contributor to psychoanalytic thinking in areas such as repression, schizophrenia and the death-wish (Kerr, 1994).</p>
                <p>Although Carotenuto appears uncertain as to the full extent of the relationship between Spielrein and Jung, he acknowledges that they were erotically involved and that Jung’s letters about the matter to Freud in 1908 are fearful and guilt-ridden. Freud rallied around Jung and Carotenuto is critical of the two men’s attitude to Sabina. For instance, Freud writes to Jung in 1909: ‘The way these women manage to charm us with every conceivable psychic perfection until they have attained their purpose is one of nature’s greatest spectacles’ (Carotenuto, 1982: 175).</p>
                <p>In contrast, Carotenuto says that her letters to Freud, starting in 1909, display dignity and a sense of responsibility: ‘So my last hope of salvation was to speak with a person who deeply loves and respects him (Jung), who possesses a profound knowledge of human nature, and when I received your last letter, unfavorable though it was to me, tears came to my eyes: “He loves him! What if he could understand all this!’” (Carotenuto, 1984: 176).</p>
                <p>The two—Jung and Spielrein—suffered all the bitter-sweet torments that are the inevitable accompaniments to passion: ecstasy, jealousy, anguish. Jung, for his part, feared exposure and ruin and tried in vain to separate from Spielrein. When her mother wrote a pleading letter to Jung asking him not to undo the good work he had done by exceeding the bounds of friendship, he replied:</p>
                <p>You do understand, of course, that a man and a girl cannot possibly continue indefinitely to have friendly dealings with one another without the likelihood that something more may enter the relationship. For what would restrain the two from drawing the consequences of their love? A <em>doctor</em> and his <em>patient</em>, on the other hand, can talk of the most intimate matters for as long as they like, and the patient may expect her doctor to give her all the love and concern she requires. But the doctor knows his limits and will never cross them, for he is <em>paid</em> for his trouble . . . if you wish me to adhere strictly to my role as doctor, you should pay me a fee as suitable recompense for my trouble. (Carotenuto, 1984: 94)</p>
                <p>Spielrein sent this to Freud with an accompanying letter, as follows: How terribly insulting that must have been for my mother . . . though my mother did not know that Dr. Jung had the right to accept private patients, she did give him gifts in lieu of money . . . the entire matter has become complicated lately (precisely because he has ceased to figure as a doctor in my life). (Carotenuto, 1984: 95)</p>
                <p>As more letters between the protagonists have come to light, recent scholarship has taken an increasingly nuanced view of the most famous triangle in psychoanalysis. Zvi Lothane’s (1999) paper in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">International Journal of Psychoanalysis</em> divides the relations between Jung and Speilrien from 1904 - 1911 into four phases: 1904 - 5—the inpatient treatment; 1906 - 8—the deepening friendship; 1909 - 10—the erotic/sensual relationship; 1911—Jung published her doctoral dissertation in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jahrbuch</em>.</p>
                <p>Lothane dissents from the view that the relationship between Spielrein and Jung in the years between 1904 - 10 was a sexual one and an ethical breach of the doctor-patient boundary. Jung appears to have misinterpreted rumours concerning a sexual scandal to do with another woman as emanating from Spielrein and Lothane’s conclusion is that the episode had no ill effect on the Freud/Jung relationship. In an unpublished letter of Spielrein’s written in 1908 to her mother she declares:</p>
                <p>So far we have remained at the level of poetry that is not dangerous, and we shall remain at that level, perhaps until the time when I will become a doctor. (Lothane, 1999: 1197)</p>
                <p>Lothane interprets the much-discussed term ‘poetry’ in this letter as pointing to tender embraces, as the letter makes it clear that she and Jung have not consummated a sexual relationship. Freud is even-handed in his interpretation of both Spielrein and Jung being caught in ‘endopsychic’ phenomena and confesses that he himself has come close to it a number of times. According to Lothane, Freud’s letter of 1909 about the woman patient who had introduced herself to a colleague as Jung’s mistress refers to another woman entirely.</p>
                <p>Sabina eventually moved to Vienna where she trained to be a psychoanalyst. She moved to Geneva in the 1920s, where she was a member of the Psychoanalytic Society along with Piaget (whom she analysed) and de Saussure. She returned to Russia in 1923 and was shot with both her daughters by the Nazis in 1941.</p>
                <p>Perhaps her greatest legacy for Jung was the insight into the erotic transference/countertransference they experienced together, which he later wrote up as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Psychology of the Transference</em>. Her paper ‘Destruction as the cause of Coming into Being’, prefigures Freud’s theory of the <em>death instinct</em> which he expounds in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em>, and in which he acknowledges his debt to Spielrein.</p>
                <p>Another woman who was intimately involved with Jung and with the first Psychological Club founded in Zurich in 1916 was a Dutchwoman, Maria Moltzer. According to his close associate, Jolande Jacobi, Jung had an affair with Moltzer.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Toni Wolff</em></p>
                <p>The most long-lasting extra-marital relationship of Jung’s was with Toni Wolff, a young woman in her twenties when he first met her, who came from a wealthy Swiss family. She was initially a patient of his whom he treated for depression. Later, when Jung struggled with the psychotic images that arose from the depths of his unconscious after the break with Freud, it was Toni who was his guide and who helped him through the difficult years. In the following quote <em>‘nekyia’</em> refers to Odysseus’s return from the land of the dead in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Odyssey</em>.</p>
                <p>When Jung began his <em>nekyia</em> into the unconscious, Toni Wolff was the one he turned to. He shared his dreams and active imaginations with her, which he recorded in his Red Book. She became his soul mate for psychological matters in a way that Emma could not provide. (Kirsch, 2000: 8)</p>
                <p>She was a gifted analyst and helped Jung with his work in every way becoming a founding member of the Psychological Club in Zurich in 1916 and its president from 1928 to 1945. For much of that time, individuals who entered analysis with Jung would also have analysis with Toni Wolff.</p>
                <p>A triangular relationship existed between Emma, Toni and Jung for forty years but their relationship had cooled by the end of the 1940s and he did not attend her funeral after her sudden death in 1953. Gerhard Adler had an analytic session with her on the day before she died, which he described as follows:</p>
                <p>I could tell her how I felt that all the splintered bits of my psyche seemed to have come together, how conscious and unconscious, female and male aspects, felt in a true <em>coniunctio</em>. It was one of those rare hours, when everything seemed ‘in Tao\ Toni was so near and warm and human, with a charming smile—we laughed a lot during this hour—that our relationship seemed closer than ever. (Adler, 1978: 11)</p>
                <p>Adler was brought to this final, fateful meeting with Toni Wolff through a series of synchronistic happenings. Jung’s concept of synchronicity is described by Adler as follows:</p>
                <p>. . . the concept of a space-time-continuum . . . explains synchronistic phenomena as well as the knowledge of future or spatially distant events . . . Here we are in the realm of transcendental phenomena, in the realm of absolute knowledge not mediated by the sense organs. The space-timecontinuum of modern physics is irrepresentable just as archetypes and synchronicity produce a picture of the world so irrepresentable as to be completely baffling. (Adler, 1978: 13)</p>
                <p>Robert Hinshaw’s collection of papers on Toni Wolff, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Essays on Jung’s Psychology</em> (2000), will shortly be available in English.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Subjective confession</h3>
                </header>
                <p>This chapter has attempted to show the major personal formative encounters in Jung’s life and work. His relationship to his parents was crucial in forming him both as an individual and in his ideas. As a young man, one of his influential experiences was with the occult through his mediumistic cousin, Helene Preiswerk. A number of women after this featured prominently in his life either as coworkers and/or personal relationships. There were also several significant men, perhaps the most important being C A . Meier, who for many years was Jung’s ‘crown prince’ and the first president of the Jung Institute in Zurich. Other important male figures included Gerhard Adler, Peter Baynes, James Hillman, James Kirsch, Erich Neumann, Franz Riklin and Father Victor White, some of whose ideas are to be found in this book. Jung seems to have considered Neumann the most brilliant of them and the one who would continue his work - which inspired a great deal of envy from some of the other analysts around Jung.</p>
                <p>Part of this chapter has been devoted to the controversial impact on Jung by Freud. In the volume of his works devoted to Freud and psychoanalysis, Jung states that the modern psychologist cannot make statements about the nature of the psyche that are ‘true’ or ‘correct’ but can only formulate statements that are the truest expression of their personal psychologies. Even when dealing with empirical data, the psychologist is necessarily speaking about him or herself. For Jung , Freud could not get beyond his own psychological state which was neurotic and one-sided.</p>
                <p>The subjective nature of psychology is summarized by Jung as follows: ‘Philosophical criticism has helped me to see that every psychology—my own included—has the character of a subjective confession’ (Jung, 1961: 336). Here Jung demonstrates that he is an existential thinker, viz. one who draws his entire existence into his philosophical reflections. Further, this confession, with its overtones of a religious nature, was well-suited to his own approach which grew largely out of himself as <em>homo religiosus</em> for whom the meaning of life was of supreme importance.</p>
