                    <h1 class="notranslate" translate="no">3 Jung’s Major Practical Contributions</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Jung’s practical contributions evolved out of his own approach to the analytic process which for him consisted essentially in a dialogue and a mutuality requiring the emotional involvement of the analyst for change to occur. In recent times, psychoanalysis has also begun to address the importance of the subjectivity of the analyst for the analytic work. The Jungian techniques elaborated in this chapter are mostly those specifically discovered by Jung himself, although it has to be said that many Jungian practitioners have turned to clinical techniques from psychoanalysis to provide insights into pathological states such as denial, resistance, defences, acting-out, enactment, attacks on linking, projection, projective identification, reverie and above all, transference and countertransference and have integrated these into their clinical practice.</p>
                <p>Those who incorporate the clinical with the mythological and remain in the tension between the two find that it is creative in their analytic work. For other practitioners it is experienced as a mythological/clinical split and it is along this fault line that the splits in the Jungian world have occurred.</p>
                <p>In setting up the analytic contract with a patient or analysand, Jungian practitioners follow the same procedure used by psychoanalysts from other schools. Frequency of sessions per week, the possible duration of the therapy and the fee are discussed and agreed on in the initial session. Some Jungian practitioners favour the chair over the couch for the patient’s use, as Jung himself did. However, many use either the couch or chair depending on the individual patient’s perceived requirements at the time of starting therapy.</p>
                <p>Some of Jung’s specific contributions to practice include: <em>amplification</em>, his concept of <em>archetypal</em> transference/countertransference, <em>active imagination</em> and dream analysis. These will be elaborated further in what follows.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Amplification</h3>
                </header>
                <p>As has already been pointed out, Jung was inspired by Frank Miller’s raw material to go on and develop many of his own ideas. One of these, amplification, is a way of connecting the content from a dream or fantasy with universal imagery by way of using mythical, historical and cultural analogies. Jung takes the title and related content of a poem of Frank Miller’s, ‘The Moth to the Sun’, and amplifies it to bring out its metaphorical meaning.</p>
                <p>Jung states that in this poem God becomes the sun, which is a perfect representation for divinity with its polarized beneficent lifegiving powers counter-balanced by its destructive ones. For this reason, its zodiacal manifestation is the lion, which Samson killed to free the parched earth from its scorching rays. This powerful force, the libido, is the driving strength of the soul, which may be diverted into either creative or destructive acts.</p>
                <p>Jung then looks to the Upanishads and the Persian sun-god Mithra to amplify his theme. One quote from the Upanishads goes as follows:</p>
                <p>The Man of the size of a thumb, resides in the midst within the self, of the past and future, the Lord.</p>
                <p>The Man of the size of a thumb like flame free from smoke, of past and of Future the Lord, the same is today, tomorrow the same will He be.</p>
                <p>T om Thumb then represents the phallic symbol of the libido which is also found in Goethe’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em> (1951 abridged version):</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mephistopheles</em>: I’ll praise thee ere we separate: I see Thou knowest the</p>
                <p>devil thoroughly: Here take this Key.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em>: That little thing!</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mephistopheles</em>: Take hold of it, not undervaluing!</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em>: It glows, it shines, increases in my hand!</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mephistopheles</em>: How much it is worth, thou soon shalt understand, The key will scent the true place from all others! Follow it down! - ‘twill lead thee to the Mothers!</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the drama the devil, in the form of the black dog, says the following: ‘Part of that power, not understood, Which always wills the bad and always creates the good.’ This paradox is at the heart of Jung’s approach and he often quotes it to support his contention that without evil nothing can be created.</p>
                <p>The phallus is the symbolic representative of universal creative power and many of the creatures that personify this power wear the phallic pointed hat that denotes it. These include dwarves, Attis (the earlier manifestation of Christ), and Mithra. The dwarf form conjures up the idea of the eternal youth, the personification of the creative impulse in Jungian psychology. Jung continues to amplify in this vein until he ends by linking the term libido, in its broadest sense, to Schopenhauer’s meaning of Will. The highest expression of libido used in this way in human form is in the manifestation of the religious hero.</p>
                <p>Returning to the myth of Pramantha, touched on in the previous chapter, which denotes the phallus that bores rhythmically into the opening in the feminine wood to produce the resulting fire, Agni, which is the offspring of this sexualized symbolic act of fire production. What Jung is trying to show here is the link both to what the patient was doing unconsciously but also to a universal phenomenon of the discovery of fire through sublimation of sexualized libido.</p>
                <p>Jung links this sexualized libido with the libido from the presexual stage of the infant’s development which, as we saw above, is different for him to Freud’s autoerotic stage. The presexual stage for Jung is the nutritional stage and it is the regression to the presexual psychological stage that combines with the sexualized libido to produce the ancient symbols of agriculture.</p>
                <p>In the work of agriculture hunger and incest intermingle. The ancient cults of mother earth and all the superstitions founded thereon saw in the cultivation of the earth the fertilization of the mother. The aim of the action is desexualized, however, for it is the fruit of the field and the nourishment contained therein. The regression resulting from the incest prohibition leads, in this case, to the new valuation of the mother; this time, however, not as a sexual object, but as a nourisher. (Jung, 1991: 152)</p>
                <p>In the case of the production of fire, Jung again points to the regression back to the presexual stage, in particular to the displaced rhythmic activity. As we saw, he relates the latter to masturbation or onanism, and the conclusion he arrives at is that fire production was originally an act of quasi-onanistic activity.</p>
                <p>Similarly with the development of human speech, Jung traces its origins to a regression to the presexual stage where it turns to the external world to find an outlet. In the Upanishads, speech is called a light and related to the light of the Atman, the creative psychic force or libido. In this way, speech and fire may be seen as the first human arts that have resulted from the transformation of libido.</p>
                <p>Both Agni and Christ are the ones who are sacrificed and who leave their redeeming fluids behind. With Christ it is his redeeming blood; with Agni it is the Soma, the holy drink of immortality. Both these link back to the presexualized libido of the presexualized nutritional stage. Christ’s body and blood are ingested and the Soma is seen as the nourishing drink. The link back to the nutritional stage is why so many myths depict gods being devoured.</p>
                <p>Jung links the sexualized libido that produces fire through rhythmic activity to onanism. The latter activity is a way of protecting the perpetrator from being involved in life because through onanism the greatest magic of sexual gratification lies within one’s own power. In this way, one does not have to conquer sexual desire through wrestling with reality.</p>
                <p>Aladdin rubs his lamp and the obedient genii stand at his bidding; thus the fairy tale expresses the great psychologic advantage of the easy regression to the local sexual satisfaction. Aladdin’s symbol subtly confirms the ambiguity of the magic fire preparation. (Jung, 1991: 166)</p>
                <p>Jung relates this to the case of the peasant boy who was an incendiary. He was caught because it was noticed once that he was masturbating while watching the latest of his conflagrations. Although the preparation of fire has become an ordinary everyday activity, there is still the ceremonial preparation of fire which is hedged about with ritual activity. There are different ways of responding to the psychological regression that lies between the acting-out of a sterile onanism or the alternative, which is the path of sublimation.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The ‘Analytic Third’</em></p>
                <p>As can be seen from the above, the traditional usage of amplification as a technique takes the object as its starting point and then enlarges on it by way of mythological motifs. In a recent paper written by the American analytical psychologist, Joe Cambray, amplification has been rethought to take in its evolving role in analysis incorporating subjective and objective aspects of the amplifactory process (Cambray, 2000). Jung himself said: ‘If I wish to treat another individual psychologically at all, I must for better or worse give up all pretensions to superior knowledge, all authority and desire to influence. I must perforce adopt a dialectical procedure consisting in a comparison of our mutual findings’ (Jung, 1954: 5).</p>
                <p>The use of the term ‘subjective’ traditionally applied to the patient’s subjectivity in contributing personal and dream contents in a session. Cambray explores instead the analyst’s subjectivity in using the amplifications that come to mind during a session. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>, Jung was seeking to locate himself in what he called ‘my myth’ through which he became linked to a profound sense of self. ‘Thus the subjectivity of this “my myth” attitude is inextricably linked to a reified, perhaps somewhat autistic self, rather than a post-modern self emerging out of the play of psychological processes. The latter is more in accord with the inescapable subjectivity of the analyst in relation to the reality of an other’ (Cambray, 2000: 13).</p>
                <p>Cambray advocates sparing use of the analyst’s internal amplifications rather than silence or transference interpretations when a patient is curious about those. It is vital to guard against overindulgence on the part of the analyst in airing their internal processes as this can lead to narcissistic displays with corresponding envious feelings on the part of the patient. The need for a combined analyst/analysand narrative in the amplicatory process arises in the interactive field between the two and can give rise to the ‘analytic third’ which is constellated between the two in the interactive field that exists between them and is not entirely the analyst nor entirely the analysand. These concepts are explored more fully in the section below that deals with Schwartz-Salant’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Archetypal Foundations of Projective Identification</em>.</p>
                <p>The exploration through amplification of the myths embedded in both the analyand’s, as well as the analyst’s, psyche ultimately <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(ideologically)</em> emanates from the ‘analytic third’. ‘Amplification, in this light, can be re-presented as an unfolding of the objective psyche as it plays through our diverse subjectivities’ (Cambray, 2000: 20).</p>
                <p>Cambray illustrates the shared amplificatory discourse with the following piece of case material that took place just before a break. The patient was a psychologically sophisticated entrepreneur who had recently been diagnosed as suffering from an untreatable, chronic, debilitating illness and this was ‘casting a pall over the analytic work’. The symbolic and relational aspects of his psychosomatic illness were looked at analytically but this did nothing to alleviate his despair. As a result of the analyst’s reverie and amplification, the countervailing theme of ‘hope’ becomes important as we shall see.</p>
                <p>My own reveries as we entered this impasse led me back to a memory of a childhood illlness that similarly had been poorly understood and to how I had had to try and manage my mother’s anxieties, as well as my own, especially around visits to the family physician. I recalled a coping strategy from that period in which reading myths played a prominent role. These had provided containing images for my distress, and heroic figures I could identify with to counter the ills. Pursuing these memories of the discomfort in having to supply hope then led me to remember the tale of Pandora. (Cambray, 2000: 23)</p>
                <p>Briefly, the myth of Pandora stems from Zeus’s planned retaliation for the theft by Prometheus of fire from the gods to give to humankind. She is fashioned into a desirable woman from earth and water and bestowed with desirable attributes to make her even more alluring. She was brought to earth along with a great sealed jar and first offered to Prometheus, who was too canny to be seduced. Epimetheus, however, is easily taken in and eagerly accepts her. When Pandora opened the sealed jar, all the ills that beset humanity were released leaving only hope behind.</p>
                <p>The accessing of this myth in response to the anger and despair directly related to illness and absence experienced by the ‘analytic third’ led Cambray to share it too quickly with the patient, who scornfully dismissed it. The analyst had Pandora-like spilled the contents of his mind into the session and the patient’s scornful reaction was a form of projective identification that inhibited the analyst’s capacity for symbolic play. Instead, he became embarrassed. The analyst’s sharing at the moment that he did so had been inappropriately timed and was experienced by the patient as trying to shift the emphasis too quickly from the complexed interactive field, in which the ‘analytic third’ was caught, to the symbolic field. The Pandora amplification accessing hope was tactless, even though accurate, as it proved unbearable for the patient at that moment.</p>
                <p>As a result of this insight, the analyst was able to empathize with the emotional suffering the patient was trapped in and this resulted in a more secure alliance and ‘deeper exploration of the analysand’s schizoid defenses (as well as my own) became possible’ (Cambray, 2000: 25).</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Archetypal Transference and Countertransference</h3>
                </header>
                <p>The importance of alchemy for Jung in establishing an historical precedent for his approach to psychology has already been written about above. The principal goal the two had in common was the extracting of gold from base metals, although this was, of course, symbolic in the more sophisticated alchemical work as it was in the psychological. This section will illustrate how Jung applied alchemy in practice with regard to its use in archetypal transference and countertransference. Jung had ambivalent views about transference and at one time called it the alpha and omega of the analytical method. At others, he talks of its importance as relative, for instance, where he says: º personally am always glad when there is only a mild transference or when it is practically unnoticeable’ (Jung, 1954: 172).</p>
                <p>However, this was not the case when it came to a powerfully erotic instance of it and Carotenuto, in his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Secret Symmetry</em>, claims that it was Jung’s own experience of this in his work with Sabina Speilrein that led to his writing about it many years later in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Psychology of the Transference</em> (Carotenuto, 1982).</p>
                <p>Some of the concepts from alchemy have already been touched on above, for instance, the <em>coniunctio</em>. This referred to the idea of the mystic or higher marriage which has two sources in alchemy: one Christian, the other pagan. The Christian denotes the union of Christ and the Church; the pagan that of the marriage of the mystic with God.</p>
                <p>The image of the coniunctio has an archetypal basis in the unconscious and it is this imagery that can become activated in an in-depth analysis. According to Jung, the analyst and the analysand are both equally in the work and will thus be equally affected by the unconscious processes they encounter. Jung used the image of the alchemical vessel to denote the analytical container in which the transformation of the two takes place. This is why individuals in Jungian analysis often talk of analysing ‘with’ someone rather than being analysed ‘by’ them.</p>
                <p>Dreams may signal the onset of an archetypal transference in producing the kind of symbolism that is associated with a conjoining or coming together of opposite forces. Examples of this would be a dove, the classical symbol of reconciliation, or a winged serpent, denoting the symbolic union of above with below.</p>
                <p>The sort of psychic energy that becomes activated between analyst and analysand at this time is experienced as having a mercurial, even impish or diabolical quality. In alchemy, this was personified as Hermes or Mercurius—the patron g o d of both alchemy and analysis. Jung came to call this figure the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Trickster</em>, and it is everywhere and at all times active in human doings which is why one is always saying and doing foolish things which, with a little foresight, could be avoided. It also explains why millions of people can get caught in mass cults like that of Nazism and why Pythagoras could not set up, once and for all, the rule of wisdom, or Christianity the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth.</p>
                <p>As the patron g o d of both alchemy and analysis, the Trickster is to be found at work in alchemical texts that at times describe in astonishing detail the sort of phenomenology that can be observed in the analysis of unconscious processes. Jung turned to one, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em>, to shed light on archetypal transference/countertransference phenomena in the analytical situation. This is a medieval text illustrated with drawings of a royal couple dating from 1550 for as Jung says: ‘These curiosities of the Middle Ages contain the seeds of much that emerged in clearer f o rm only many centuries later’ (Jung, 1954: 201).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rosarium</em></p>
                <p>The idea of the quaternity is a universal phenomenon denoting the idea of wholeness that is central to alchemy. There are the four seasons, four elements, four primary colours and four psychological orientations as explored above under psychological types. The whole work of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em> revolves around Goethe’s life-long search for the fourth function, thinking, which was his inferior one. In the same way, what some of the more perceptive alchemists were in quest of was the ‘gold’ that was to be found through contacting the inferior function buried deep in the unconscious. For Jung, the alchemical quest was akin to the central goal of analysis which he came to call <em>individuation</em> and the integration of the ‘inferior’ fourth function into consciousness is one of the major tasks of individuation.</p>
                <p>As the illustrations are an important part of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em>, I will paint word pictures of the relevant ones. If the reader wishes to look at them, they are in Volume 16, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Practice of Psychotherapy</em>, in the chapter entitled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Psychology of the Transference</em>. They are also to be found in Nathan Schwartz-Salant’s (1989) <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Borderline Personality</em>, which is dealt with in the next section and in Elie Humbert’s (1984) <em class="notranslate" translate="no">C.G. Jung</em>, in the section after that. Picture 1 of the text is of the mercurial fountain and contains much alchemical symbolism: the sun and moon as opposites; the four elements depicted by four stars; and the fountain or vessel wherein the transformation takes place. The uprising and flowing back of the water in the mercurial fountain characterizes Mercurius as the serpent endlessly fertilizing and devouring itself until it gives birth to itself again.</p>
                <p>Picture 2 brings in the element of incest that is an essential component of the archetypal transference and countertransference. The King and Queen, bridegroom and bride, are depicted as standing on the sun and moon pointing to the incestuous brother-sister relationship of Apollo and Diana. Sun and moon in alchemical texts are called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sol</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Luna</em> and this more mature model took the place of Jung’s early division of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Logos</em> (differentiatedness) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eros</em> (relatedness). The incestuous nature of the relationship depicted in the picture is emphasized further by the left-handed contact between the two - that is from the sinister or unconscious side. Further associations with the left side are to do with the heart which is related to love but also with all the moral contradictions that are connected with affective states.</p>
                <p>This left-sided contact in the picture indicates the dubious nature of the relationship, which is a mixture of heavenly and earthly love with the added ingredient of incestuous love. The couple are holding a device of two flowers each in their right hands which criss-cross each other. These are further crossed at their meeting point from above by a flower held in the beak of a dove.</p>
                <p>The incest that is portrayed here is a central characteristic of the alchemical and the analytical work. It must be emphasized here that Jung is not advocating actual incest but, instead, is pointing to the symbolic kind which was also portrayed in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>. What he is actually getting at is that individuating, becoming one’s own person, entails a symbolic re-entry into mother, that is, a regression back to the incestuous relationship in order to be reborn. Symbolic incest, therefore, represents a coming together with one’s own being, a union of like with like which is why it exerts an unholy fascination—as we know from the all-too-frequent occurrences of it in ordinary life.</p>
                <p>In much the same way, a powerful ‘incestuous’ attraction may be activated between analyst and analysand when the archetypal processes come into play during the course of an in-depth analysis. The criss-crossing remarked on above is now revealed in the pattern of relationship that comes into play between the analyst and the analysand. The energy can flow in a variety of directions but does not usually do so at the same time. However, there may arise times during the course of an in-depth analysis when all the energy channels are active simultaneously, which leads to massive confusion. These are the times when the relationship is in danger of breaking down or of being acted-out in some way.</p>
                <p>One path that is open between the two is the uncomplicated personal relationship. Another is the relationship of each to their <em class="notranslate" translate="no">anima/animus</em>, also known as the <em>syzygy</em>, lying in the unconscious. The animus is the archetypal active principle and the anima the archetypal passive one. In Jung’s ‘classical’ theory, the animus belonged in the woman’s unconscious and the anima in the man’s. More-recent thinking has revised this to incorporate the yoked syzygy equally into male and female unconsciousness.</p>
                <p>The next path of relationship is between the yoked anima/animus of each to the other. Lastly, there can be a one-sided projection onto the analyst of the woman’s animus or of the man’s anima when the conscious attitude is identical with animus or anima. This may activate a corresponding counter-projection on the part of the analyst so that the two are then caught in an anima/animus projection onto each other which usually results in an acting-out of some sort. The acting-out may at this point take the form of a sexual relationship and, as it is of a deeply unconscious kind, it would be tinged with unresolved incestuous impulses.</p>
                <p>Jung went on to call this kind of incestuous attraction <em>kinship libido</em> and it is ultimately through the spiritualization of this incestuous libido that the psychological alchemical work comes to its fruition in the constellation of the coniunctio and the birth of the divine child, which is individuation.</p>
                <p>Picture 3 of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em> shows the King (Sol) and Queen (Luna) in naked confrontation with the dove once again between them. The text says: ¼ Luna, let me be thy husband,’ and Luna responds, ¼ Sol, I must submit to thee’ (Jung, 1954: 236). The eroticism of the picture is mediated by the dove both as a symbol of the soul which provides the relational aspect between the King (spirit) and the Queen (body). The psyche is then seen to be half spirit and half body.</p>
                <p>Picture 4 depicts the two figures naked in the alchemical bath with the dove again between them. The psychology of this picture centres on a descent into the unconscious - a kind of ‘night sea journey’ - which is the path taken in all heroic myths leading to symbolic rebirth.</p>
                <p>Picture 5, The Coniunctio, shows the pair in a passionate embrace enclosed by the water and they have returned to the chaotic beginnings. At first sight it looks as if instinct has triumphed but the psychology of the coniunctio is not so simple. The union depicted here denotes the symbolic union of opposites and in this way instinctive energy is transformed into symbolical activity. The dove, the uniting symbol, has disappeared as the pair themselves have become symbolic.</p>
                <p>Picture 6 shows the death or <em>nigredo</em> stage that follows on from the coniunctio as once the opposites unite the flow of energy ceases. Death means the extinction of consciousness and the stagnation of psychic life. The two are united in one body but with two heads. ‘The situation described in our picture is a kind of Ash Wednesday’ (Jung, 1954: 260). This annual lamentation which takes place in many cultures corresponds to an archetypal or typical event. This is linked to the incestuous theme which runs through the whole of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em> in the following way. The difficult dilemma that anyone undertaking a confrontation with the unconscious is faced is that nature will be mortified either way because to commit incest goes against nature but equally so does not yielding to ardent desire. With the integration into the ego of the powerful contents in the unconscious there results an inevitable inflation which has a serious impact on the ego which may be experienced as a death.</p>
                <p>Picture 7 shows the soul mounting to heaven out of the decaying unified body of the King and Queen. This corresponds psychologically to a dark state of disorientation and the collapse of egoconsciousness. When the ego is overwhelmed by unconscious contents this is experienced as a loss of soul - the dark night of the soul that is depicted in the writings of St. John of the Cross.</p>
                <p>Picture 8 shows the dead couple being sprinkled on by falling dew from heaven. The previous stage of the darkness of death when the union of opposites reaches its nadir now begins to lighten. This is what Jung calls an <em>enantiodromia</em>, the psychological law touched on above which was discovered by Heraclitus where everything eventually transforms into its opposite. This law underwrites Jung’s concepts of the self-regulating power of the psyche and of <em>compensation</em>.</p>
                <p>Picture 9 shows the soul returning from heaven and unifying with the purified body. It is this unification which is the goal of the perceptive alchemists and depth-psychologists alike—in the latter case it is the freeing of ego-consciousness from contamination with the unconscious. Just as relationship is at the centre of the alchemical transformation so, too, in analysis it is the relationship between analyst and analysand that effects the transformation of both.</p>
                <p>Picture 10 shows the birth of the <em>androgyne</em>, the symbol of wholeness, with the right side of the body being male and the left female. This signifies that the individual has reached the stage of consciousness where the opposites represented by Sol and Luna are held in balance. This is different to the earlier figure of the <em>hermaphrodite</em> which is the state of primordial union. In Picture 10, the <em>androgyne</em> stands on the moon—the feminine principle—and holds a snake depicting the principle of evil which is connected with the work of redemption. This section will conclude with a quote from the text of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em>:</p>
                <p>It is manifest, therefore, that the stone is the master of the philosophers, as if he (the philosopher) were to say that he does of his own nature that which he is compelled to do; and so the philosopher is not the master, but rather the minister, of the stone. (Jung, 1954: 313)</p>
                <p>The androgyne symbolizes nothing less than the philosopher’s stone or individuation and is the end result of a slow process of analysis during which the libido is extracted from the alluring fascination of the eroticized transference/countertransference. The two sections below will flesh out the above with clinical approaches to the alchemical text of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em>.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Archetypal Foundations of Projective Identification</em></p>
                <p>The American analytical psychologist, Nathan Schwartz-Salant, has related the alchemical imagery of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Transference</em> to Klein’s concept of <em>projective identification</em>, both of which appeared in 1946 (Schwartz-Salant, 1989). They met with very different receptions: Klein’s work had an electrifying effect on many psychoanalysts, while Jung’s was seen as too abstract, even by analytical psychologists, to be useful in clinicial work.</p>
                <p>As this paper uses projective identification as its central motif, it would be a s well to say a few words about it. It is an unconscious way of interacting with another which is often accompanied by feelings of confusion and panic but there is another aspect to it as Rosemary Gordon (in Schwartz-Salant, 1989) has pointed out: it has the power to break down boundaries. These include inner psychic boundaries, as well as those between self and others. Jung uses several terms which equate with projective identification: ‘unconscious identity’; ‘psychic infection’; ‘participation mystique’; and ‘feeling-into’.</p>
                <p>As with everything in Jung, there is always a positive as well as a negative aspect to anything and he was interested in the creative/ destructive possibilities that were inherent in projective identification. Schwartz-Salant relates this to Jung’s work based on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em>, which was the latter’s Ariadne’s thread that led him through the complexities of the transference.</p>
                <p>The dominant image in this work is of the hermaphrodite linking aspects between opposites. Both the positive and negative aspects of the hermaphrodite are experienced in projective identification, for example, the harmonious linking of opposites leads to complementary aspects of a process. On the other hand, conflicting opposites lead to the chaotic states—fusion and splitting—of projective identification experienced in borderline states of mind.</p>
                <p>In the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Transference</em>, Jung proposes that the phenomenology of participation mystique activates the archetypal transference. Schwartz-Salant claims that Jung’s alchemical speculations addressed processes in what he calls the <em>subtle body</em> area which is akin to Winnicott’s concept of <em>transitional space</em>. This space is not located inside, outside or between people but to a ‘third’ area whose processes can only be perceived by the eye of the imagination. This lies in an interactive field structured by images that have a strong effect on the conscious personality. Projective identification is directed to the transformation of processes in this third area.</p>
                <p>Identifying it is crucial in the initiating of the alchemical opus, for instance in getting into the <em>prima materia</em> or unconscious or in arriving at the <em>nigredo</em>. The therapist must be able to maintain sufficient emotional distance from the powerful feelings that are engendered in him by the borderline patient otherwise the former will continue to be manipulated into enacting the latter’s fantasies. The strong affects that may be engendered in this way include boredom, fury, avoidance and anxiety.</p>
                <p>Schwartz-Salant gives an example of what it feels like to be the ‘container’ for contents projected into it. A male patient was having a conversation with him when he stopped suddenly at a point where it would have been more natural for him to continue talking. At the same time, the patient behaved as if nothing were wrong. After a while it became clear that each was waiting for the other to say something. This became gradually more painful until the therapist felt impelled to bridge the intolerable tension.</p>
                <p>The reason for the powerful feelings in this period was the result of the patient’s projective identification which was putting his blank mind into the therapist: ‘He was easing this “absence”, encased in a paranoid shell, into me, then watching me in hope that I would somehow return to him his (functioning) mind . . . when I disengaged and ended the encounter, the patient grew angry’ (Schwartz- Salant, 1989: 102).</p>
                <p>The alchemical model moves the therapist out of the sphere of having to know it all by the discovery of the ‘unconscious couple’. The process causes the two parties to get involved in transforming the third, which is Mercurius, and in this way to be transformed themselves.</p>
                <p>As was shown above, the early pictures depict dangerous fusion/ splitting states. The alchemical process offers the possibility of transforming negative projective identification of this kind into a more positive outcome without undervaluing its dark, chaotic aspect. At the height of feelings of dissociation on the part of the analyst and analysand as portrayed in Picture 7, a mystery at the interactive level is being enacted and the soul is ascending toward a state of union with the transcendent self.</p>
                <p>When the higher marriage between analyst and analysand begins to feel more stable, positive experiences of the hermaphrodite begin to emerge to create a linking quality between the two that is the source of the therapeutic alliance which is crucial to the work with borderline patients. The unified self that is constellated becomes the generator of shared experiences which are the proper goal of projective identification.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Alchemical Process</em></p>
                <p>The French analytical psychologist, Elie Humbert, has written an accessible book on Jung’s work entitled C G . <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung</em>. One chapter of the book is about the transference as elaborated by Jung through the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em> text. Although transference/countertransference projections are an everyday part of living, the clinical version offers the possibility for both therapist and patient to make these projections more conscious and in that way to reclaim them as part of oneself.</p>
                <p>In common with Jung and Schwartz-Salant, Humbert reiterates that the way to enable this to happen is through relationship which is why an individual would find it impossible to analyse themselves through reading a book. Mere abstract knowledge will not enable the necessary unconscious processes to become active that are needed for psychological growth. This psychotherapeutic relationship, for Jung, is founded on ‘psychic contagion’:</p>
                <p>The patient, by bringing an activated unconscious content to bear upon the doctor, constellates the corresponding unconscious material in him, owing to the inductive effect which always emanates from projections in greater or lesser degree. (Jung, 1954: 176)</p>
                <p>For Humbert, what Jung means by ‘psychic contagion’ refers to the countertransference and a state of mutual unconsciousness is essential in the analytic relationship. There are obvious dangers in this and both may become fixed in the eroticized component of the transference/countertransference when the mutual demand for actual physical intimacy becomes overwhelming. There are various typical responses to this state on the part of the analyst and if the latter becomes caught in any of them it is likely to lead to acting-out of one sort or another.</p>
                <p>Powerful anxiety feelings is one response on the part of the analyst who feels out of their depth and this can result in a defensive admonitory way of dealing with the patient. One actual incident I know of was of a male analyst saying to a woman patient: ‘I am not Jung and you’re not Toni Wolff!’ This kind of stern acting-out of the countertransference is potentially destructive of the analytic work and an analysis may break down at this point. The opposite response is a mutual ‘falling into’ the erotic feelings culminating in an actual affair.</p>
                <p>As we saw in Jung’s elaboration of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em> incest is the underlying motif of both that text and of the analytical relationship. This needs to be contained and not acted-out so that it may eventually culminate in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hieros gamos</em> or endogamous marriage. Jung took the terms ‘endogamy’ and ‘exogamy’ from anthropology and they apply in the first instance to marriage within the kinship group and in the second to marriage outside of it. Jung applied these terms to his two models of marriage—one the spiritual/ psychological one, the other the outer/legal one.</p>
                <p>The incestuous feelings experienced in the analytical relationship draw their power <em>teleologically</em> from the goal in analysis of bringing consciousness back to its unconscious sources. As we saw from Jung’s treatment of the alchemical text, what interested him was the analogy between the royal couple depicted there and the unconscious process that develops between analyst and analysand which generate the multiple relationships that can arise between the two.</p>
                <p>Pictures 3 and 4 show the King and Queen naked and Humbert interprets this to mean that the honeymoon phase of the analysis is over and that <em>shadow</em> contents are beginning to be constellated in the analytic relationship.</p>
                <p>But it happens eventually that analysts make a mistake: an error, a forgetful moment, a lapse, they stumble—a small thing perhaps, yet their shadow appears. This is a moment of truth. (Humbert, 1984: 75)</p>
                <p>The analysis may break down at this point because the analysand may feel either critical of the analyst for not being perfect or released from a transference coloured by the fantasy of the ‘allknowing one’. This may be as far as an individual analysand needs to go as it enables the person to live more authentically.</p>
                <p>Picture 5 shows the couple having intercourse, which figuratively points to them uniting in the quest for greater consciousness. This is followed by the depression generated by the inhibition of the incestuous longings. The long process of death—depression—and purification has now been embarked on. This is a long initiation that involves psychological death leading eventually to rebirth and in tribal cultures is accompanied by instructing of the initiate by the elders as to what they are experiencing. The analyst must now be wary of succumbing to this way of dealing with the patient’s feelings of anguish and despair during this initiatory period as the analysis could then degenerate into a purely intellectual or spiritual exercise.</p>
                <p>In Picture 9 the figure of the androgyne, the psychologically more evolved figure to the earlier one of the hermaphrodite, is shown now in a purified state as the soul returns to join with it. The importance of the androgynous figure is that it symbolizes the true realization for the analysand that what has been looked for on the outer level in a partner or the analyst is now found <em>within</em> where it truly belongs. The resolution of transference/countertransference feelings is now well on the way as the energy constellated has been used up. The end result is the ability on the part of both to walk away from the analytic work with mutual feelings of wellbeing and satisfaction. An analysis that is aborted has a deleterious impact on both parties as an in-depth analysis involves a lengthy investment of time and energy and the ability of the analyst and analysand to withstand the rigours that are a part of the process.</p>
                <p>Humbert says that Picture 10 depicting the new birth through the royal marriage shows the androgynous two-headed figure wearing two crowns. The new birth has come about through the relationship between the ego and the self which engenders the symbolic function. The capacity for symbolization is the fount of all creativity and it is the realization of this through the conjunction of opposites that Jung saw as ‘the principle of humanization at work’ (Humbert, 1984: 81).</p>
                <p>An important point to bear in mind about Jungian analysis is that its true goal is not narcissistic self-absorption for the length of its duration but the continuing investment in relationships with others. ‘The unrelated human being lacks wholeness, for he can achieve wholeness only through the soul, and the soul cannot exist without its other side, which is always found in a “You”‘ (Jung, 1954: 244).</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Active Imagination</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Jung’s writing on the <em>transcendent function</em> has been touched on already in the first Chapter and is closely allied to the use of active imagination so that a description of the former is necessary before going on to delineate the latter. Jung first wrote his paper on the transcendent function in 1916 and it remained unpublished until it was discovered many years later by students of the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich. Jung revised it in 1958, 42 years after he had first tackled the subject.</p>
                <p>In this paper, Jung is attempting to show how coming to terms with the unconscious may be put into practice. He emphasizes yet again that this is a religious and moral undertaking not to be undertaken lightly as the subliminal contents of the psyche possess such a powerful charge that they can produce a psychosis when unleashed. ‘For the unconscious is not this thing or that; it is the Unknown as it immediately affects us’ (Jung, 1960b: 68).</p>
                <p>He is also at pains to differentiate his <em>synthetic</em> approach from what he scathingly calls the <em>reductive</em>—the difference between the two will become clear as the contents of the paper unfold themselves.</p>
                <p>The transcendent arises from the union of conscious and unconscious contents. He derived the term ‘transcendent’ from mathematics concerning the function of real and imaginary numbers. Just as consciousness is antithetical to the unconscious so it is simultaneously complementary to it and vice versa. Briefly, the unconscious contains all the fantasy and forgotten contents which have not yet risen above the threshold of consciousness and is also the realm of the inherited structuring constituents of the psyche—the archetypes. Consciousness, on the other hand, because of its directed way of functioning, exercises an inhibiting attitude to incompatible unconscious contents.</p>
                <p>In order for civilization to evolve it was vital for humankind to develop a directed, well-functioning consciousness. This was accompanied by a repression of unconscious contents resulting in a one-sidedness due to the banishment of these from the conscious realm. However, unwelcome contents make themselves felt in a variety of ways, for instance, through dreams or slips of the tongue and, if the repression is extreme, in pathological symptoms.</p>
                <p>Jung’s answer to this is to advocate getting rid of the separation between conscious and unconscious. This may be accomplished through activating the transcendent function, which is composed of tendencies from both realms. This may be constellated by a constructive or synthetic analytic approach where the analyst is aware of the potential of the transcendent function. In this way, the analyst mediates the transcendent function for the patient, helping to bring the conscious and unconscious together to arrive at a new attitude.</p>
                <p>The synthetic approach, according to Jung, is the one that values symbolic meaning in dream images or fantasies in their own right rather than reducing them to being caused by something in the individual’s childhood. In this way, unconscious phenomena are regarded as if they had intention and purpose (teleology) pointing to future psychological development. The consequence of this approach for the analytical relationship is that everything emanating from the patient should not be regarded a s historically true but as subjectively so. For instance, the erotic transference may be seen historically as infantile but its true significance, according to Jung, lay not in its historical antecedents but in its purpose. The symbolic meaning in the erotic transference as explored above in the section on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rosarium</em> is what needs to be made conscious. ‘The word “symbol” being taken to mean the best possible expression for a complex fact not yet clearly apprehended by consciousness’ (Jung, 1960b: 75).</p>
                <p>Jung’s intention in activating the transcendent function is to gain access to the self-regulating function of the psyche, which he sees as having been inhibited by critical attention and the directed will. As the unconscious loses its regulating influence it has an intensifying effect on conscious processes as energy that is repressed builds up a charge that may then explode. Jung cites Nietzsche as an example of this:</p>
                <p>Thus the regulating influence is suppressed, but not the secret counteraction of the unconscious, which from now on becomes clearly noticeable in Nietzsche’s writings. First he seeks his adversary in Wagner, whom he cannot forgive for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Parsifal</em>, but soon his whole wrath turns against Christianity and in particular against St. Paul, who in some ways suffered a fate similar to Nietzsche’s . . . (whose) psychosis first produced an identification with the ‘Crucified Christ’ and then with the dismembered Dionysus. (Jung, 1960b: 80)</p>
                <p>Knowledge of the regulating influence of the psyche can prevent much bad experience and so gaining access to this knowledge is a necessary part of healthy living. Jung illustrates the way to gain access to this and says that the intensity of any emotional disturbance is where the actual value lies—for it is the energy that is caught up in this which needs to be released for it to be at the individual’s disposal. However, this cannot be done intellectually.</p>
                <p>The way to realize the transcendent function is to gain access to unconscious material and Jung points to various ways of doing this. He calls this process <em>active imagination</em>, which is the collaboration of the conscious and unconscious mind in order to facilitate the emergence of those contents that lie just below the threshold of consciousness. The co-operation of a strong ego is absolutely central to this process as it is not without its dangers, the most serious of which is the possible possession of the conscious mind by unconscious contents which can result in a psychotic episode.</p>
                <p>The starting point of active imagination must always be the emotional state and becoming as conscious as possible of the mood that is around is vital. One way of accessing this is through writing down without reservation any fantasies as they occur.</p>
                <p>Another is through painting or drawing and individuals who possess some talent in this direction can give expression to their mood by visualizing it. In this way something is created which is influenced by both conscious and unconscious, giving the former an outlet in its striving for substance and the latter in its striving for the light of awareness. Other possible methods that may be helpful are working with plastic materials, body movement and automatic writing (see above).</p>
                <p>The whole procedure is a kind of enrichment and clarification of the affect, whereby the affect and its contents are brought nearer to consciousness, becoming at the same time more impressive and more understandable . . . it creates a new situation, since the previously unrelated affect has become a more or less clear and articulate idea, thanks to the assistance and co-operation of the conscious mind. This is the beginning of the transcendent function i.e. of the collaboration of conscious and unconscious data. (Jung, 1960b: 82)</p>
                <p>All critical attention must be suspended and an attitude of expectation be engendered instead. Also, it is important to guard against being seduced by the intellect, on the one hand, or by an over-valuing of the aesthetic content, on the other. The latter can lead to an egoorientated attempt to create pretty pictures. Vigilance is required at all times during this process as it is easy for the conscious attitude to predominate with its greater familiarity and clearer formulations. Feeling-toned contents are far less comfortable to deal with.</p>
                <p>Jung goes on to make the all-important point that a capacity for inner dialogue is essential in enabling outer dialogue which presupposes an acceptance of the validity of other points of view. ‘For, to the degree that he does not admit the validity of the other person, he denies the ‘other’ within himself the right to exist—and vice versa’ (Jung, 1960b: 89).</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dream Analysis</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Jung held dreams to be of the highest importance in portraying messages from the unconscious to consciousness and we saw above how each turning point in his own life was preceded by a significant dream.</p>
                <p>Similarly, dreams play a central role in Jungian analysis and some analyses are based almost entirely on working with dream material. I see patients and analysands f r om other parts of the world and they often ask for a ‘dream analysis’. In my experience, this involves the patient bringing a written account of the dreams immediately preceding the analytic session. Sometimes a copy of this is given to the analyst and the two work on it together. I find this as creative a way of conducting analysis as any other as long as the sessions do not become flooded with dream images, which can easily be used defensively by the patient to prevent any in-depth analysis taking place. I usually find, instead, that it is possible to detect recurring motifs in any dream series and identifying these opens up the way to working with the patient’s resistance and defences, as well as, work in the transference.</p>
                <p>Examples of some recurring dream images are: anxiety feelings; feelings of inadequacy; sexual themes that reveal the patient’s sexual frustration or over indulgence; parental complexes; abnormal fear of illness or death; violent affect or the opposite which manifests as a lack of concern in situations where this would be aberrant. The following brief quote summarizes Jung’s view of dreaming (Jung’s italics): ‘. . . the dream is a <em>spontaneous selfportrayal, in symbolic form, of the actual situation in the unconscious’</em> (Jung, 1960b: 263).</p>
                <p>Dreams have always exercised a fascination for humankind which is related to the strangeness of their content and origin. ‘They do not arise, like other conscious contents, from any clearly discernible, logical and emotional continuity of experience, but are remnants of a peculiar psychic activity taking place during sleep’ (Jung, 1960b: 237). Their ubiquitous fascination may also lie in the fact that they were phylogenetically an older mode of thinking as Nietzsche suggests.</p>
                <p>At first sight the contents may appear unrelated to anything in conscious experience but further exploration will show that some of them have their origin in the recent past.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of dreams is their capacity to point the way forward. ‘We know . . . that every psychic structure, regarded from the final standpoint, has its own peculiar meaning and purpose in the actual psychic process. This criterion must also be applied to dreams’ (Jung, 1960b: 240).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Finality</em></p>
                <p>To exemplify his hypothesis of <em>finality</em> Jung presents the following dream with accompanying associations to it: ‘I was standing in a strange garden and picked an apple from a tree. I looked about cautiously, to make sure that no one s aw me’ (Jung, 1960b: 241). The above was the dream of a young man who associated to it in this way. As a boy he had stolen pears from a neighbour’s garden. The bad conscience left over from that act is evident in the dream and reminded him of an experience from the previous day. On this occasion he had encountered a young woman who was a casual acquaintance and they had exchanged a few words. At that moment a man passed by whom he knew and he was aware of a sudden feeling of embarrassment as if he knew he was doing something wrong.</p>
                <p>The apple in the dream reminded him of the one in the Garden of Eden and he had never come to terms with the fact that the eating of it had such dire consequences for the first parents. It made him feel angry with God who was punishing humankind for the qualities he had instilled in them in the first place. His further association with this was that his father had sometimes punished him for things that he found incomprehensible. One of these, for which he sustained the worst punishment, was secretly watching girls bathe. This finally led to the revelation that he had recently begun a liaison (as yet unconsummated) with a housemaid and h ad a meeting with her on the evening before the dream.</p>
                <p>The erotic associations with the dream are fairly obviously accompanied by the feeling of bad conscience so that the linking theme becomes one of <em>guilt</em>. It is vital to take these two components together in order to arrive at the purpose of the dream which is to bring into greater awareness for the dreamer that he has unconscious guilt feelings about erotic events. It is he himself who is judging his conduct as reprehensible although consciously he appears to think that there is nothing wrong in what he is doing as all his friends are doing the same thing.</p>
                <p>Jung then explores the meaning of moral standards that have been handed down through the ages, particularly with regard to the strongest desires. The way that this collective inhibition relates to this particular young man and his associations to the content of his dream are to demonstrate to him the necessity of a moral standpoint which he is trying to deny.</p>
                <p>In his conscious attitude, the young man denies that there are any moral consequences of his actions but ‘man is a morally responsible being who, voluntarily or involuntarily, submits to the morality that he himself has created’ (Jung, 1960b: 244). Here again we encounter the compensatory nature of the unconscious in opposing the conscious attitude. Jung refers to St. Augustine who said that he was glad that God did not hold him responsible for his dreams. This compensatory function is the reason why it is essential to know the individual’s conscious situation at the moment of dreaming.</p>
                <p>This deeply moral sense that permeates all Jung’s work led to him being accused of stepping outside the realm of psychology and into that of theology as was stated above in the section devoted to Father Victor White. His response to this charge which he reiterated many times over is as follows:</p>
                <p>the moral order, nor the idea of God, nor any religion has dropped into man’s lap from outside, straight down from heaven, as it were, but . . . he contains all this within himself, and for this reason can produce it all out of himself . . . The ideas of the moral order and of God belong to the ineradicable substrate of the human soul. That is why any honest psychology . . . must come to terms with these facts. (Jung, 1960b: 278)</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Compensation</em></p>
                <p>A compensatory dream of Nebuchadnezzar from the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Book of Daniel</em> while he was at the height of his power demonstrates the vital function of dreaming. The dream went as follows:</p>
                <p>I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</p>
                <p>The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, And the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</p>
                <p>The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</p>
                <p>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven;</p>
                <p>He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</p>
                <p>Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. (Book of Daniel: 10-16 AV, in Jung, 1960b: 251)</p>
                <p>The tree is, of course, Nebuchadnezzar himself and the dream is an attempt at compensating the megalomania of the king, who ended by becoming psychotic. This kind of dream may appear to anyone who has an over-weaning sense of their own value as they have risen outwardly beyond their capacity as an individual. In today’s terms this is known as the Peter Principle, which is tellingly portrayed by Anthony Powell as the egregious fictional character, Widmerpool, in his series of novels ‘A Dance to the Music of Time’.</p>
                <p>It would be useful to give an example of the synthetic approach as described above in its application to dream analysis. An unmarried woman dreamt that someone gave her a wonderful richly ornamented, antique sword dug up out of a tumulus. Her associations with it were that her father had once flashed his dagger in the sun in front of her which had left an abiding impression. He was a strong man of Celtic origin who had many amorous adventures. She associated the sword with a Celtic one as the dream sword had ancient runes carved on it. The sword was brought to light again out of the grave.</p>
                <p>Jung’s synthetic interpretation of the dream was that the patient was above all in need of such a weapon. She lived life passively with no driving will of her own unlike her father, who had it both literally and figuratively and had used it to live a full life. His weapon was a passionate, unbending will with which he made his way through life. She had not appreciated until the dream that she was her father’s daughter and that his passionate will lay buried deep in her own unconscious.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Context</em></p>
                <p>As the contents of all dreams are non-rational? representing fragments of involuntary psychic activity, Jung’s policy when confronted with any dream was to admit to himself that he had no idea what it meant. The possible interpretations of any dream are innumerable so that the only way of arriving at a fitting interpretation is with the dreamer’s associations and Jung developed a method which he called ‘taking up the context’. He compared this with the deciphering of a difficult text and described it as consisting in taking up every salient point in the dream with the dreamer.</p>
                <p>The following example of a dream - not easily understandable at first - was that of a young man. He was, at the time, engaged to a young woman from a ‘good family’ who consistently appeared in his dreams in an unflattering—even scandalous—light. Eventually, Jung concluded that despite the young man’s conscious resistance, his unconscious portrayal of his fiancee in a negative manner meant something. The patient’s neurosis had started shortly after his engagement and this, combined with the recurring dream messages, led Jung to persuade him to initiate enquiries. These confirmed the unflattering dream images and, when the patient discontinued the engagement, his neurosis receded.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collective and Personal Dreams</em></p>
                <p>Jung goes on to distinguish ‘big’ dreams from personal ones. The former are usually remembered throughout the dreamer’s life and ‘not infrequently prove to be the richest jewel in the treasure-house of psychic experience’ (Jung, 1960b: 290). Big dreams are those that come from the realm of the collective unconscious and are archetypal in nature.</p>
                <p>Jung says that these often occur as part of the individuation process and I would like to proffer one of mine that initiated me onto my own individuating path. This dream occurred many years ago and, although it is still important to me, it has lost its affective charge so that I have been able to use it in seminars with students and in other contexts. The dream happened at the end of my first analysis which lasted for four-and-a-half years at a frequency of three times a week. Towards the end of this analysis, my analyst encouraged me to think of training as a therapist, whereupon I applied to a training institute and was accepted on the strength of a brief interview. The reader will appreciate how many decades ago this was when I say I had stopped the analysis before I started the training.</p>
                <p>Shortly before the end of the analysis, I dreamt that I was walking alone when I came to a gate. I looked over and saw a large coiled serpent asleep on the other side. At this point I took out a camera and leant over the gate to take photographs of the serpent. I was aware of feeling uneasy as I recounted this dream to my analyst, who looked concerned as she listened. She interpreted the dream to mean that I was behaving like a tourist in the unconscious and warned me of the dangers of awakening the sleeping serpent.</p>
                <p>I paid little heed in spite of the inner voice of the self urging caution. The self ‘knows’ but, at the start of the individuating process, the ego has to behave in an heroic way and go forth on its adventure in spite of the perils ahead. Needless to say, the sleeping serpent did awake not long after and I then found myself caught in an incomprehensible state of confusion and panic attacks. This eventually forced me to return to analysis - this time with a different analyst. The dream marked the rite of passage that led eventually to my training as an analyst.</p>
                <p>In explicating the images to be found in ‘big’ dreams, Jung writes the following:</p>
                <p>Here we find the dangerous adventures and ordeals such as occur in initiations. We meet dragons, helpful animals, and demons; also the Wise Old Man . . . the transformative processes and substances of alchemy . . . all things which in no way touch the banalities of everyday . . . they have to do with the realization of a part of the personality which has not yet come into existence but is still in the process of becoming. (Jung, 1960b: 293)</p>
