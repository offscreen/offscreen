                    <h1>4 Criticisms and Rebuttals</h1>
                </header>
                <p>As with the previous chapters, only some of the material that exists will be used to demonstrate the kind of criticisms that Jung, along with every seminal thinker, has been on the receiving end of since he first started to develop his own ideas. Some have already been touched on above, for instance, the statements declaring that he was overstepping the boundary of psychology into the territory of theology. There is a much greater exploration of this in the section on Martin Buber in this chapter, which will start with an exposition of the controversial issue of Jung’s alleged pro-Nazi and anti- Semitic views.</p>

                </header>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Goring institute</em></p>
                <p>In exploring the accusations against Jung in this area, it is necessary first to set the background to how psychotherapy and psychoanalysis came into being in Germany and, for this purpose, I have consulted the writings of the American student of German history and psychoanalysis, Geoffrey Cocks. He has steeped himself in the study of what happened in the dynamic field of medical psychology in Germany both before and after the advent of Hitler.</p>
                <p>Briefly, psychoanalysis began to have an impact in Germany early in the century and its concepts challenged those of the psychiatric establishment which were grounded in mechanistic empiricism and heredity. Freud’ s achievement was to combine the preoccupation with the hidden forces in the psyche of the Romantics with that of nineteenth-century materialism. The German Psychoanalytic Society was founded in 1910. However, Freud’s concern that it would remain labelled as the ‘Jewish science’ (see Chapter 1) was above all true in Germany under the Nazis when it was completely banned.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the history of psychotherapy in Germany took a different course. Due to the economic and political chaos resulting from the First World War and the fact that it was criticized by the medical establishment for being non-scientific, psychotherapy was not accepted until the late 1920s. The annual meeting of psychiatrists and neurologists in 1925 led to the first General Medical Congress for Psychotherapy in Baden-Baden followed in 1928 by the founding of the International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy. In 1930 a journal called the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zentralblatt</em> came into being which covered matters to do with psychotherapy along with psychological medicine and hygiene. ‘The primary purpose of the society and its annual congresses from 1926 to 1931 was to minimize the dissension among the various theories of psychotherapy . . . and to encourage research in the young field’ (Cocks, 1997: 24).</p>
                <p>In 1934 Jung became the President of the International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, which was composed of rival factions such as the Adlerians, including Alfred Adler; Jungians, including Jung; Stekelians, including Stekel; and Freudians, including Karen Horney and Wilhelm Reich but not Freud; and a large number of eclectic psychotherapists. Jung, for his part, hoped that in making it internationally known, psychotherapy would be protected from extinction in Germany and he stated that he was planning an institute in Zurich based ‘after our Berlin model’ (Cocks, 1997: 133). Jung’s stated intention in being associated with the Society was to act in the interest of its Jewish members. ‘. . . The Germans’ use of Jung was also in his interest in promoting analytical psychology, particularly at the expense of its arch rival, Freudian psychoanalysis’ (Cocks, 1997: 135). Cocks has no doubt that there was a genuine anxiety on Jung’s part for the Jewish members of the society.</p>
                <p>The membership of the Society as a whole comprised a largely Protestant and conservative constituency and it was this number who easily transformed themselves into supporters of the Nazi party after 1933 when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. The medical profession in Germany held largely anti-Semitic views based on Social Darwinist theories of the survival of the fittest and eugenics. After 1918 at a time of economic hardship there was particular envy with regard to the successful Jewish physicians practising in Berlin and other large cities. Jacob Burckhardt, the well-known historian, expressed concern about the decline of civilization and attributed this to venal Jews. Jung never voiced such thoughts directly but was also concerned about the decline of spiritual values and hoped that the fascist movements of the 1920s and 1930s might provide an antidote.</p>
                <p>The advent of Hitler as the Chancellor was followed by increasing persecution of the Jews, for instance, the expulsion of the predominantly Jewish psychoanalytic movement from that country. Those members of the psychoanalytic movement who did not manage to escape were tortured and murdered in Nazi concentration camps.</p>
                <p>What replaced it was a psychotherapy in service of the state which ‘for the Nazis . . . existed as an extension of what they regarded as nature, ensuring the well-being of its inhabitants for the purpose of cultivating their potential for its use . . . Health policy . . . was not so much a matter of care of the sick but of care of the healthy’ (Cocks, 1997: 92). For this reason, the psychotherapist’s role in the Nazi regime was to be an active agent on behalf of the community in leading patients to live healthy and productive lives.</p>
                <p>According to Cocks, the founders of German psychotherapy were keen to have Jung associated with it in order to provide the prestige associated with his reputation. For Jung’s part, Cocks has no doubt that the former was motivated by genuine anxieties about the survival of psychotherapy in Germany under the Nazis but he also claims that Jung and the other German psychotherapists were enthusiastic about National Socialism. As was shown in the preceding chapters, the kind of psychology that Jung was developing was strongly influenced by mythological motifs linked to a teleological orientation. The philosophy underlying this approach appeared to be in line with Nazi ideology. ‘More than one Nazi racial theoretician saw Jung’s work as indispensable in providing rich material for the history and culture of a race’ (Cocks, 1997: 137).</p>
                <p>In a broadcast in 1933 in an interview over Radio Berlin, Jung said ‘every movement culminates organically in a leader’ (Cocks, 1997: 139). He declared that there was a different European soul to the German one which was ‘youthful’ and that Europe could not understand Germany because it did not share the same heritage and psychological experiences. Jung even went on to approve Hitler’s assertion that the individual must go his own way without taking issue with the totalitarian attitudes of the Nazi regime.</p>
                <p>Jung’s actions between 1933 and 1940 have caused a great deal of controversy and Cocks’s research reveals a complicated situation with regard to Jung during these years. Enthusiasm for Jung in Germany did not mean that analytical psychology had carte blanche there. For instance, in 1936 participation by Germans was not allowed at the annual Jungian Eranos Conference at Ascona in Switzerland because Jews attended in large numbers and because some of the topics were ‘politically conflictuaP. However, it has to be said that most of Jung’s protests about the course of events in Germany were only seen or heard by non-Germans and were not voiced in the country itself.</p>
                <p>Although Jung was President of the International General Medical Society until 1940 when he finally resigned, he did not take an active part in its internal workings but confined himself to the international congresses organized under its aegis. His role in German psychotherapy diminished considerably after the founding of the Goring Institute in 1936 but it is in his role as editor of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zentralblatt</em> that he provoked most criticism. In this capacity: ‘Genuinely independent and perceptive people have for a long time recognized that the difference between Germanic and Jewish psychology should no longer be effaced, something that can only be beneficial to the science’ (Cocks, 1997: 140). This distinction between Jewish and German science was attacked by many people outside Germany as it was a theme put forward by German intellectuals in support of the Nazi regime.</p>
                <p>The same issue of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zentralblatt</em> contained an article by Matthias Goring which was full of pro-Nazi rhetoric so that Jung’s remarks could be used by German colleagues to associate his name and theory as sanctioning the Nazi regime. This was all the more the case as the journal was published in Germany. ‘Regardless of their context, however, Jung’s observations were objectionable in and of themselves to many, as they seemed to support the official anti-Semitism of the Nazi government’ (Cocks, 1997: 140).</p>
                <p>Jung again wrote an article for the journal in 1944 seeking to distinguish between an ‘Aryan’ and a Jewish unconscious claiming that Freud ‘did not know the German soul, and neither do any of his blind adherents. Has not the shattering advent of National Socialism, upon which the world gazes with astonished eyes, taught them better?’ (Cocks, 1997: 141). Jung’s criticism was addressed at Freud’s materialism and the rootlessness of modern Jewish culture and of the anti-Christian orientation of the psychoanalysts. In a letter to a colleague he stated: ‘. . . in this instance the Aryan people can point out with Freud and Adler, specific Jewish points of view are publicly preached and, as can likewise be proved, points of view that have an essentially corrosive character’ (Cocks, 1997: 142).</p>
                <p>Cocks holds a middle position between pointing to Jung’s lack of judgement in making the above statements and damning him as a Nazi collaborator. He acknowledges that Jung’s cultural relativism never deteriorated from differentiating to denigrating Jews in the crude and vicious way that the Nazis did and goes on to say:</p>
                <p>While Jung’s words here betrayed some ethically dubious habits of mind, Jung’s opponents have often reduced these pronouncements to proof of unalloyed anti-Semitism and wholehearted collaboration with the Nazis. Such a view, however, ignores Jung’s increasing disaffection toward the Nazis and his desire to protect psychotherapists in Germany. (Cocks, 1997: 146)</p>
                <p>At the same time as taking Jung’s critics to task, Cocks also observes that his defenders must be more candid about ‘the disturbing ambiguities in his thought, especially with regard to Jews’ (Cocks, 1997: 146). He asserts that uncritical admirers of Jung have tried to render harmless the latter’s assertions at a politically sensitive time. The most common approach amongst the first generation of Jungians after the Second World War was to deny that he was anti-Semitic in any way. Another has been to ignore the problem completely. ‘The third approach is to argue simplistically that Jung made mistakes rather than acting out of evil intent’ (Cocks, 1997: 146).</p>
                <p>By 1939 relations between Jung and Goring were worsening and there was no congress held that year. The latter was concerned by what he saw as Jung’s anti-German views in various ways, one being the latter’s attempts to get non-Germanic or axis powers to join the General Medical Society. Instead Goring asserted that ‘it would be very good if the authoritarian states were to join the international society so that the liberalistic states would not maintain superiority’ (Cocks, 1997: 144).</p>
                <p>By this time, Jung was clearly more jaundiced in his view of the Nazis as in the following:</p>
                <p>The impressive thing about the German phenomenon is that one man, who is obviously ‘possessed’, has infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motion and has started rolling on its course to perdition. (Cocks, 1997: 142)</p>
                <p>In 1938 after the Night of Broken Glass and the attacks on the Jewish community, the C.G. Jung Society along with others lost its official status as a registered association. Cocks summarizes Jung’s stance towards Nazism as a dialectic between prejudice and tolerance in which the latter eventually won out. However, he disagrees with the Jungian, Wolfgang Giegerich’s point that Jung was purposefully engaging the shadow of racial prejudice in order to extirpate it. Such a judgment naively ignores the plurality of motives and conditions present in any human action . . . (and) turns a blind eye to the negative effects of Jung’s lack of early criticism of Hitler and the possible legitimacy for the regime created in the minds of many or some through Jung’s association with it. (Cocks, 1997: 150)</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">‘Carl Gustav jung and the jews: The Real Story’</em></p>
                <p>James Kirsch, in the above-titled paper published in 1982, explores the case against Jung and ends by declaring him completely exonerated. ‘The fact that some of Jung’s statements concerning Jews are problematic is not denied . . . and his later rejection of his former views should be considered as the overriding feature in judging Jung’ (Kirsch, 1982: 113). Kirsch had taken issue with Jung after the Second World War about some of these views but, in the end, declared himself satisfied that Jung was not anti-Semitic.</p>
                <p>Kirsch’s own background is that he studied with Jung in 1929 and remained in frequent contact with him until the latter’s death in 1961. He went on to become a Jungian analyst and founded the Society of Jungian Analysts of Southern California.</p>
                <p>He has quotes from Jung which show him in a moral conflict about whether to remain neutral and within the Swiss frontier or to venture into Germany and bring on himself what he calls the inevitable misunderstandings of anyone who had dealings with the political powers there. According to his Secretary, Aniela Jaffe, in the article she wrote entitled ‘Jung and National Socialism’, Jung accepted the post of president of the General Medical Society at the urgent request of its leading members and managed to redraft the statutes so that Jewish psychotherapists could become members. At the same time his assistant, C.A. Meier, became the Secretary- General of the Society and the managing editor of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zentralblatt</em>. According to Jaffe, Jung and Meier did this in order to keep the young science of psychotherapy alive in Germany and to come to the aid of Jewish colleagues in Germany.</p>
                <p>Jaffe also takes up the problematic of Jung’s ambivalent attitude to Jews, quoting him as saying, on the one hand, ‘. . . the Jew, who is something of a nomad, has never yet created a cultural form of his own . . . since all his instincts and talents require a more or less civilized nation to act as a host for their development’ (Kirsch, 1982: 122). On the other hand, he protested that he was no more trying to depreciate Semitic psychology when he talked of the ‘personal equation’ than ‘it is a depreciation of the Chinese to speak of the peculiar psychology of the Oriental’ (Kirsch, 1982: 122).</p>
                <p>She does admit that he was willing to give National Socialism the benefit of the doubt in the early years: ‘The “Aryan” unconscious contains creative tensions and “seeds of a future yet to be born” was the psychological foundation of his hopes’ (Kirsch, 1982: 123).</p>
                <p>Kirsch reports that in a conversation he had with Jung in Berlin in 1933, the latter had hopes that there might be a positive outcome to the Nazi movement. He could not accept Kirsch’s completely pessimistic view and the latter’s intention of leaving Germany as soon as possible. When Kirsch s aw Jung in 1947, the latter remembered this conversation and apologized for it. Jung’s view was based on his theory of <em>archetypes</em> which would see a mass movement as being essentially archetypal - containing both evil and good—and capable of producing diametrically opposite results.</p>
                <p>For Jung, therefore, National Socialism was a manifestation of the storm-god, Wotan, that represented an outburst of the collective unconscious and he counted on the healing and creative forces in the human psyche to do their work. When this failed to happen with regard to the Nazi movement and the full extent of their horrors became known, Jung revised his hope and from then on was publicly critical of it.</p>
                <p>Jaffe states that the psychic background to Jung’s ambivalent feelings towards Jews has its deepest roots in the relationship between Freud and Jung:</p>
                <p>. . . it ended tragically in mutual resentment which has never quite died o u t . . . In their friendship and separation, so spotlighted by the world, it was not only two great personalities that confronted one another in scientific and man-to-man discussion, not only the old master and the young disciple, but, above all, the Jew and the gentile. (Jaffe, 1989: 96) One of the criticisms of Jung’s ambivalence towards the Nazis is that it stemmed from an unconscious power-drive but Kirsch completely dismisses this and says that Jung had integrated the collective unconscious to such a degree that he had acquired enormous power from that and had no need of an ego-power-drive.</p>
                <p>Kirsch also points to the sensitivity to anti-Semitism of Jews and quotes Ernest Jones as follows:</p>
                <p>I became, of course, aware, somewhat to my astonishment, of how extraordinarily suspicious Jews could be of the faintest sign of anti- Semitism and of how many remarks of actions could be interpreted in that sense. The members most sensitive were Ferenczi and Sachs; Abraham and Rank were less so. Freud himself was pretty sensitive in this respect. (Jones, 1955: 163)</p>
                <p>Kirsch acknowledges that although Jung tried to help Jews from the beginning of the time that the Nazis took over in Germany, he had an unresolved ‘Jewish’ complex. This had been activated in him by the relationship with Freud - at first in a positive way which transformed later into negative and critical feelings that extended to Jews in general. According to Kirsch, Jung completely liberated himself from it finally by writing <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em>.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">New Research</em></p>
                <p>Thomas Kirsch, the son of James Kirsch whose paper has been explored above, has conducted some original research into the issue of Jung’s involvement with the Nazis during the 1930s in his book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Jungians: A Comparative and Historical Perspective</em>. Some of this research relates to Gustav Richard Heyer, who was the first significant person in Germany to be drawn to Jung’s ideas. He and his wife had a short analysis with Jung in the mid-1920s and most German students of analytical psychology went to Heyer for analysis and training.</p>
                <p>Heyer had National Socialist affiliations and claimed that it was Jung’s own recommendation that he join the Nazi party. However, T. Kirsch cites a document housed in the National Library in Berlin, written by Heyer in February 1944, that states as follows:</p>
                <p>I did my training analysis with C.G. Jung in whose teachings the breakthrough was made from ‘alien’ construct. Yet today I cannot underwrite everything he published. Several things differentiate us, for instance, that he is more researcher than physician; that he does not value my inclusion of the feminine into psycho-therapy, and besides such scientific differences there are also different attitudes to political situations. (Kirsch, 2000: 126)</p>
                <p>In 1945, Jung wrote to a colleague in Munich that he would have nothing further to do with Heyer because of the latter’s Nazi affiliations. T. Kirsch also states that a number of Jewish people who saw Jung during the 1930s say that they detected no trace of anti-Semitism in him. T. Kirsch’s mother, also an analyst, told him that it was through her analysis with Jung that she came to understand what it meant to be Jewish.</p>
                <p>Everyone looks for a ‘smoking gun’ to prove that Jung was really a Nazi way back when. It is not there. What Jung did not do is openly and publicly repudiate the Nazis before the war. That criticism could be made of many other influential people. There is still the expectation that Jung, as a depth psychologist, should have known better. (Kirsch, 2000: 132)</p>
                <p>Ô. Kirsch raises the question as to whether Jung’s theories promote racism, for instance, the hypothesis of the collective unconscious. For his own part, he does not believe them to have a racist bias and, in any case, they are open to scientific enquiry. He declares that he feels a sense of relief about the fact that personal anecdotes told to him by many Jewish people point to the fact that Jung pulled away from any association with the Nazis possibly as early as 1934.</p>
                <p>Recently, T. Kirsch has had an exchange of letters with Harold Blum, the director of the Freud Archive in New York, in the new journal <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychoanalysis and History</em>, in which Blum called Jung a Nazi. (Personal communication with Thomas Kirsch.)</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lingering Shadows</em></p>
                <p>Maidenbaum and Martin’s book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lingering Shadows</em>, published in 1991, grew out of a New York conference in 1989 and from papers given at a workshop during the Eleventh International Congress for Analytical Psychology in Paris in the same year. At both these, debates focused on the question of Jung’s involvement with the Nazis and the related issues about whether he was anti-Semitic, self-promoting or just unfortunate in being where he was in the 1930s.</p>
                <p>Contributors to the book itself were drawn from a wide source, including Jungians. This section already includes coverage from their own sources by some of the writers represented in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lingering Shadows</em>, but one fascinating chapter deserves special mention and that is the one contributed by the psychoanalyst, Micha Neumann, son of a close colleague of Jung’s, the analytical psychologist, Erich Neumann.</p>
                <p>During the 1930s, Jung and Neumann corresponded on Jewish matters and the latter implored Jung to delve more deeply into these and tried to keep up his positive relationship with Jung. In the end, for E. Neumann, the inner connection to Jung was more important than their different human experiences as Jew and Christian and the unpleasantnesses that occurred between them. After <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kristallnacht</em>, Å. Neumann wrote to Jung on 15 December 1938:</p>
                <p>I do not know if you can imagine how difficult it is to maintain an inner relationship with a man who naturally feels, at most, a superficial connection to the events that injure all of us Jews . . . Still I feel the need to write to you once again in order to sustain within me the feeling that even for a Jew like myself there still exists some piece of Europe. (Maidenbaum and Martin, 1991: 282)</p>
                <p>Micha Neumann takes a different view to his father and says that there was a blind spot in Jung with regard to the Jews that had its roots in the complicated and conflict-laden relationship with Freud. This was due not only to the father projections onto Freud but also had strong elements of religious contents.</p>
                <p>He identified himself unconsciously with Nazi symbols, ideology, and anti-Semitism. He believed in the positive collective ‘Germanic soul’, to which he felt he belonged. Is it not true that Jung’s shadow remained repressed and cut off from his own consciousness? (Maidenbaum and Martin, 1991: 276)</p>
                <p>One telling incident recorded at the back of the book and told to this writer by Hella and Gerhard Adler, is that of Franz Riklin’s visit to Vienna in 1938. A large sum of money was gathered together by some rich Swiss Jews and Riklin was sent with this to Austria in order to try to bring out some of the prominent Jews. He went to see Freud with this offer but the latter responded: ‘I refuse to be beholden to my enemies.’ Riklin knew that Jung would be very sorry but, although sad, Jung was not surprised saying: ‘He (Freud) would not take help from me under any circumstances’ (Maidenbaum and Martin, 1991: 382).</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Political Psyche</em></p>
                <p>Andrew Samuels, another contributor to the above book, has been instrumental in opening up these issues within the Jungian community. In his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Political Psyche</em> Samuels says that both defenders and attackers of Jung are sitting in judgment on him and looking for a ‘final solution’ to the Jung problem. As Samuels expresses it: ‘The shadows surrounding Jung are going to linger, for they want us to pay psychological attention to them’ (Samuels, 1993: 294).</p>
                <p>Samuels takes issue with those who defend Jung on the grounds that he was a man of his times, for instance, the Jungian Adolf Guggenbühl-Craig’s statement that ‘the anti-semitism of Jung was a sheer banality of the collective he belonged to’ (Samuels, 1993: 294).</p>
                <p>In response, Samuels cites a number of criticisms of Jung in the 1930s, one being that of the philosopher and critic Walter Benjamin who studied Jung’s works in order to criticize them on political grounds. In Benjamin’s opinion Jung had ‘leaped to the rescue of the Aryan soul with a therapy reserved for it alone’ (Samuels, 1993: 295). A month later he wrote that Jung’s psychology was ‘the devil’s work’ (Samuels, 1993: 296).</p>
                <p>Many of the articles that appeared in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zentralblatt</em> at the time of Jung’s editorship consisted of repeated attacks on ‘Jewish’ mental states countered by praise for Aryan psychology. Many also praised Hitler and the Nazi party. Even though the journal was published in Germany and Jung and Meier were editing it from Zurich there were occasions when anti-Semitic statements were taken out by Jung or Meier or papers by Jewish writers included. Samuels asks why they only sometimes exercised their editors’ discretion and what to make of the fact that many anti-Semitic ideas were allowed to be published in the journal.</p>
                <p>Samuels has made a study of one of the co-signed pieces that Jung wrote for the journal with Matthias Goring—a 70th birthday tribute to Dr Robert Sommer in which they particularly praise a new chapter in a book he wrote in 1927. The following lines from that chapter are indicative of many others: ‘There has been an intrusion of alien blood into the Germanic race’; ‘The type of the Nordic race . . . forms a contrast . . . to the backwards sloping forehead of the primitive human races’; ‘The selection of the gifted has to be performed’ (Samuels, 1993: 299).</p>
                <p>The reason Samuels puts forward for Jung’s approval of these statements is echoed in Cocks above: that Jung’s position at the head of German psychotherapy enabled him to promote analytical psychology. Freud had maintained that psychoanalysis had to be accepted in Germany before it came into its own. ‘History, and Hitler, put that goal within Jung’s grasp’ (Samuels, 1993: 299).</p>
                <p>The point Samuels is making is that Jung’s papers and editorials in the 1930s related to racial and national psychologies, in particular the kind of disturbing statements he made about Jewish culture and psychology could easily be taken to be underwriting Nazi ideology. One instance of this is what Jung said about the Jews never having created a cultural form of their own but needing a ‘host nation’ in order to develop has strong echoes of Hitler’s image of the Jews as parasitic.</p>
                <p>If Jung had only been the president of the General Medical Society in support of his a im to save psychotherapy in Germany and to protect the rights of Jewish psychotherapists then there would be far less controversy over his activities still in evidence today. Samuels cites Jung’s own theory of meaningful coincidences that is called <em>synchronicity</em>, to demonstrate the merging of Jung’s thoughts with his actions: ‘. . . the psychic world (his ideas on Jewish psychology, perhaps) and the social world (German politics, perhaps) are acausally intertwined’ (Samuels, 1993: 302).</p>
                <p>Defenders of Jung claim that he was not personally anti-Semitic but even here Samuels produces evidence to the contrary. Michael Fordham has reported that on meeting Jung for the first time he was greeted with a long harangue against the Jews and the ‘parasitic elements in Jewish psychology’.</p>
                <p>Again in a letter Jung wrote in 1945 to Mary Mellon, the wife of the American multi-millionaire, Paul Mellon, he says:</p>
                <p>you probably have heard the absurd rumor that I am a Nazi. This rumor has been started by Freudian Jews in America . . . I found a falsified photo of mine in the Psychological Seminar of Calcutta University. It was a photo retouched in such a way as to make me appear as an ugly Jew . . . It is however difficult to mention the anti-christianism of the Jews after the horrible things that have happened in Germany. But Jews are not so damned innocent after all—the role played by the intellectual Jews in prewar Germany would be an interesting object of investigtation.</p>
                <p>(Samuels, 1993: 304)</p>

                <p>Samuels points to the twin concepts in Jung’s thinking that link it with National Socialist ideas around leadership and nation. These are discussed at length in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Political Psyche</em>, and the interested reader is directed to that book for further reading.</p>
                <p>This section will content itself with a brief look at Jung’s own ambivalence about leadership which found expression, on the one hand, in his denial of leadership ambitions in trying to create a following in the much-quoted statement: ‘Thank God I’m Jung and not a Jungian’. In contrast to this are his statements in the interview on Radio Berlin in 1933, alluded to above, where he appeared to accept the idea of a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Führer</em>—in other words of unquestioned leadership. Jung did display attributes of leadership in many of his statements, including his ideas around individuation, but there is still an atmosphere of denial about this in the Jungian community which prefers to see him instead as only unworldly.</p>
                <p>The idea of nation that was common to both Jung and National Socialism was that of blood and soil. This postulates that the land in or on which an individual lives not only influences the psyche and the psychological development of that individual; it can, according to Jung, even cause profound physiological changes such as the size of the skull.</p>
                <p>It was Jung’s attempt to found a cultural psychology that brought him into line with Nazi thinking. Further, his fascination with the question of leadership added to the nexus between the two. Both have their roots in Germanic Romantic philosophy which, when activated, can result in powerful forces being unleashed in the psyche on a mass or individual level. In Zurich in 1946 Jung admitted to Rabbi Leo Baeck that he had ‘slipped up’.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Case of Dr Carl Gustav Jung</em></p>
                <p>The section on Jung’s activities in this area will close with an account from a file that came into my possession some time back. About 13 or 14 years ago, I was informed that there existed a file on Jung at the British Foreign Office. accusing him of being a Nazi collaborator. This document is mentioned in several accounts by people who have never seen it often with a strong bias indicating that it provides proof of Jung’s alleged pro-Nazi sympathies.</p>
                <p>Attempts to get hold of this file had so far been unsuccessful so I contacted a friend in the Cabinet Office and asked if he could do anything to obtain it. The next thing I knew was that the file arrived by post with the compliments of the Foreign Office. It is entitled ‘The Case of Dr. Carl Gustav Jung: Pseudo-scientist Nazi Auxiliary by Maurice Leon’.</p>
                <p>The file was put together in 1946 at the time of the Nuremberg Trials (I am using the same spelling as the document). It contains a 15-page denunciation of Jung by a man living in New York called Maurice Leon. There is nothing in the file to show who he is or from where he originates and enquiries at the Foreign Office have been to no avail in this regard. As a result, there is a restriction on copyright to do with the document itself as permission cannot be sought. This means that I can only give a summary of the content of his denunciation of Jung and will not be able to include lengthy verbatim extracts from the document itself.</p>
                <p>The file also includes a few letters from officials at the Foreign Office and the latter have generously granted permission for me to reproduce them. As they are quite short, I will quote them in full.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to know how to appraise the Leon document as it is an uneasy mix of the horrors of the Nazi regime combined with slightly comical accounts of Jung’s personal and professional life. The plaintiff starts by saying that the letters column of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New York Herald Tribune</em> of 22 November 1945 contained correspondence for and against Jung as a Nazi. Leon himself is quite sure that Jung was and cites the latter’s ‘blatant outburst’ in support of the over-running of Russia. He goes on to say that supporters of Nazism should be held responsible for the horrors of Dachau, Buchenwald and Auschwitz.</p>
                <p>From there he proceeds to say that since Jung’s deviation from Freud, his followers have been made up of frustrated women who claim that he is of ancient Swiss descent whereas Leon declares that he is German.</p>
                <p>Visitors to Jung’s house ‘of rather forbidding mysterious exterior’ in Kusnacht were received ‘by Jung’s wife, a woman of sad countenance who acted as an assistant to her husband, but in a capacity secondary to that of Jung’s principal assistant, Fraulein Toni Wolff.’ Jung himself is described as ‘a tall, gray-haired man of enigmatic mien’. Patients and other visitors succeeded one another at hourly intervals and were charged 50 Swiss francs each. Wealthy Americans were amongst these, including an American Senator whom Jung apparently claimed to have cured but who died soon after. The American women who came were either accompanied by their husbands or not and in the latter case this often resulted in divorce.</p>
                <p>The document goes on to assert that ‘these two great minds (Hitler’s and Jung’s) concurred in favouring a specifically German religion’ over the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. It also gives an account of the General Medical Society and claims that Jung knew what the Nazis were doing in concentration camps.</p>
                <p>Jung’s article on Wotan is portrayed as a justification of Nazi neo-paganism in comparing it to what the Jews did to others in the name of Jehovah and the Moslems in the name of Allah - ‘another Semitic experience of God’. Most of the rest of the document is based on this paper of Jung’s and on the assertion that he, like the Nazis, was caught in the paganism that was unleashed at the time. Leon concludes that: ‘Only those who pursue illusions will believe that the sadistic madness implanted in German minds will soon disappear. The process may take a century.’ H e advocates that Jung, as the leader of the intellectuals who supported the Nazis, should be brought to justice in Germany along with his confederate Hermann Goring.</p>
                <p>This document was sent to Lord Vansittart, a well-known Germanophobe, who wrote on 6 March 1946 to a Mr P. Dean in the Legal Adviser’s Department at the Foreign Office as follows:</p>
                <p>Dear Mr Dean,</p>
                <p>I am sending the enclosed to you because I was asked to do so by Maurice Leon, who is a good friend of ours and very influential in the United States. I don’t suppose there is anything to be done about Jung as he seems to be Swiss now, but Dr. Goring is just the sort of fellow who ought to be brought to book, together with a great number of his fellows. Yours sincerely, Vansittart</p>
                <p>Pat Dean’s assistant replied as follows on 25 March 1946:</p>
                <p>Dear Lord Vansittart,</p>
                <p>Many thanks for your letter of the 6th March addressed to Pat Dean enclosing two copies of an article by Maurice Leon. We are sending a copy of the article to Dean who is now in the Control Commission in Berlin.</p>
                <p>Yours sincerely, F.F. Garner</p>
                <p>F.F. Garner wrote to Mr P. Dean at the British War Crimes Executive, Nuremberg, on 25 March 1946, as follows:</p>
                <p>Dear Dean,</p>
                <p>I enclose herewith a copy of an article by a Mr. Maurice Leon which was sent to us by Lord Vansittart under cover of a letter addressed to you. We feel that the best thing to do with this article is to put it straight into the waste paper basket and forget about it.</p>
                <p>We are acknowledging receipt of Lord Vansittart’s letter and are telling him that we have passed a copy of the article on to you.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Martin Buber’s Criticism</h3>
                </header>
                <p>The religious philosopher, Martin Buber, had positive relations with Jung from the early 1920s when Emma Jung had taken part in his week-long conference on T a o i sm in the Netherlands. Subsequently, Buber had read a few of Jung’s essays, which he said had made a positive impression on him, and had taken part in the Jungian Eranos Conference at Ascona in 1934. In his book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Religion and Modern Thinking</em>, Buber had called Jung the leading psychologist of the day in making religion comprehensible in its historical and biographical forms.</p>
                <p>It was, therefore, a shock to many people in Europe, America and Israel when the controversy between Buber and Jung emerged in 1951 with the former’s critique of the latter, accusing him of being a Gnostic and not a psychologist. This was shocking to many because the traditional enemy of religion was Freud, while Jung was seen as its great friend. Also, many of Jung’s followers were close to Buber in sharing with both men a concern for modern man’s search for a soul and the <em>collective unconscious</em> has a transpersonal and <em>numinous</em> (i.e. awe-inspiring) feel to it.</p>
                <p>The real issue for Buber was that it is that part of Jung’s thinking that transmutes faith into <em>gnosis</em> (knowledge) which amounts to a Gnostic transformation of faith that accounts far more than any other thinking for what Buber called the ‘eclipse of God’. ‘This same issue of <em>gnosis</em> - knowing <em>about</em> faith - versus <em>devotio - actually living faith</em> in the dialogue of addressing and being addressed’ (Friedman, 1991: 356). For Buber, the real crisis of our time is the struggle between gnosis, which wants to know, and devotio, which wants to serve and sanctify. ‘The difference between the world with God and without God is so enormous that the discussion of God must divide except in a group united by a real common faith’ (Schaeder, 1973: 464).</p>
                <p>In his book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eclipse of God</em>, Buber took issue with Jung and the German philosopher, Martin Heiddeger. Although he respected the service that Jung’s psychological research had rendered to religious thinking, his criticism of Jung rested on his assertion that psychology must observe its limits and is not authorized to judge religion as an aspect of actual human existence. The ‘eclipse of God’ or suspension of the ethical in our age means that ‘honest men lie and compassionate men torture’. This eclipse was above all due to the Holocaust, which violated existential trust in a way that nothing had before. ‘When God seems to withdraw himself utterly from the earth and no longer participates in its existence’ (Friedman, 1986: 148).</p>
                <p>With each new crisis the contract between the universe and humans and the community and humanity is dissolved and human beings find themselves solitary and homeless in the world. ‘The question about man’s being faces us as never before in all its grandeur and terror - no longer in philosophical attire but in the nakedness of existence’ (Friedman, 1986: 151).</p>
                <p>Buber saw Jung as a modern Gnostic and thought that this was more dangerous to the ‘eclipse of God’ than Heidegger’s writing on ‘being’. The following statement by Buber makes this clear:</p>
                <p>The psychological doctrine which deals with mysteries without knowing the attitude of faith towards mystery is the modern manifestation of gnosis. Gnosis is not to be understood as only a historical category, but as a universal one. It—and not atheism, which annihilates God because it must reject the hitherto existing images of God—is the real antagonist of the reality of faith. Its modern manifestation concerns me specifically not only because of its massive pretensions, but also in particular because of its resumption of the Carporcratian motif. This motif, which reaches as psychotherapy, is that of mystically deifying the instincts instead of hallowing them in faith. (Friedman, 1991: 358)</p>
                <p>The issue for Buber here is that truth is either reduced to the psychic and becomes mere tautology or the psychic is elevated to truth and becomes a false hypostasizing. This is because Jung is not a traditional Gnostic who believes in a transcendental God but a modern one who puts forward in its stead the collective unconscious and the self. Buber goes on to say that these can never be addressed as ‘Thou’ or engaged with in real dialogue as with the transcendent yet present Hebrew God. There is no sense of God needing humanity nor of God as the Creator - instead the divine is placed in the unconscious psyche and in this way becomes psychologized.</p>
                <p>If Jung had not asserted the psyche as <em>the</em> exclusive touchstone of reality, he could have bestowed great honour upon a realm that undoubtedly has profound meaning . . . without hypostasizing that realm into an inverted Platonic universal and elevating this larger-than-life-size sphere to the now empty throne of the Absolute. (Friedman, 1991: 359)</p>
                <p>Buber’s critique of Jung was closely related to his Hasidic teachings in which he says that what ancient Christian and non-Christian Gnostics and recent Gnostical movements have in common with psychoanalysis is the following. Those particular Gnostic movements reject all creation as evil and incapable of being hallowed but, the argument runs, the ‘elect’ being completely holy have the task of making everything unhallowed holy. In this way, they are encouraged to sin in order to raise sin to holiness by preserving an inner intention of purity in contrast to the deed.</p>
                <p>This demonic ‘lust for overrunning reality’ to use Buber’s words, amounts to a crisis in people’s souls of temptation and dishonesty. He saw Jung’s analytical psychology and psychoanalysis in general to be advocating an illusory belief that personal fulfilment can be found through the release of deep inner forces and that Jung’s psychology, in particular, pointed to succumbing in part to evil as the road to the integration of the self and thus to individuation. This leads to the marriage of good and evil and the new incarnation where God is replaced by the deified or divine man.</p>
                <p>Buber wrote to Jung: ‘We are revealed to ourselves—and cannot express it otherwise than as something revealed’ (Schaeder, 1973: 470). Further, that my self is realized by taking the path at which, executing for my part the design which I am, I encounter the divine mystery of my created uniqueness, the mystery waiting for me’ (Schaeder, 1973: 470).</p>
                <p>In 1946, some years before he openly criticized Jung, Buber was already writing that in Jung and Karl Kerenyi’s introduction to a book on mythology, the latter was writing about myth as arising out of contact with the world; whereas Jung understood it as arising of its own in the soul.</p>
                <p>The growing distance between the two thinkers affected some of Jung’s followers and the most important of Jung’s followers to defect to Martin Buber was Hans Trüb. The two met in 1923 at the Analytical Psychology Club of Zurich and Trüb was the first to introduce Buber’s ideas into the relationship between therapist and patient. The former had trained with Jung and was a friend of his—so much so that Jung had recommended Emma Jung to him for analysis.</p>
                <p>The relationship that developed between Buber and Trüb was mutually formative and, as a result, Buber wrote about schizophrenics and borderline states. Trüb, for his part, came to see Jungian psychology as a strange mix of scientific research, medical practice, and Gnostic quasi-religious philosophy. He later left the Jungian movement and became a follower of Buber. The greatest impact he had on Trüb, according to the latter, was not through his philosophy but through the personal relationship that grew between them.</p>
                <p>Although Buber was a Jewish religious philosopher and was vitally concerned at the time of the Nazi uprising with the threat to Jewish people, he was also concerned about the threat it posed to Christianity. In 1934, when he attended the Jungian Eranos Conference at Anscona, he responded to vicious attacks on Christianity by a number of Nazis who were present by saying that although it was not usually his role to defend Christianity, he felt on that occasion that he must do so.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung’s Reply to Martin Buber</em></p>
                <p>In responding to the charge made against him by Buber that he is a Gnostic, Jung says that he has been called that as well as the opposite, an agnostic. He says he has also been accused of being a theist and an atheist, a mystic and a materialist. He asserts that these criticisms are made by metaphysicians, whose business it is to know about things in the Beyond. For his part, he denies that he has made statements in the same way about such things.</p>
                <p>As we saw in the section above on the Gnostics, Jung studied them with enthusiasm because they were the first thinkers to concern themselves, in their own way, with the collective unconscious. For his part, Jung states that he is dealing with anthropomorphic ideas but not with actual gods and devils, although due to their autonomy, they can behave like psychic <em>daimons</em>. This is interpreted by the theologian as the devil’s work and Jung admits that that is close to psychic truth.</p>
                <p>Jung claims that far from being a theologian, he is a psychiatrist whose prime aim is to investigate the psyche empirically and interpret the results. He feels that as Buber has no psychiatric experience, he cannot understand what Jung means by the ‘reality of the psyche’ and the dialectical process of individuation. The ego has always been confronted with psychic powers that have been given sacred names and identified with metaphysical beings. Analysis of the unconscious has shown that these forces produce archetypal images which, for the analyst are not inspired by the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost except for the individual who has the gift of faith. Jung says that for him these ‘powers of the unconscious’ are psychic facts and not metaphysical ones as he knows them experientially only through cognition.</p>
                <p>These forces are autonomous aspects of the <em>objective psyche</em> and act as the counter-pole to the subjective ego. In this way, they may come to be designated as a ‘Thou’—Buber’s term for the divine. For Jung, these numinous, or awe-inspiring forces, manifest their darker aspects in reality as the holocaust and the invention of the atomic bomb; but they are also the other side that is expressed in beauty, goodness, wisdom and grace.</p>
                <p>‘The reality of the psyche’ is his working hypothesis which he has supported through empirical findings. He claims that Buber has mistaken his (Jung’s) empiricism for Gnosticism and challenges him to prove that the facts that he has described are only inventions. If Buber could do this, then Jung says that he would admit that he is indeed a Gnostic but, in that case, the former would have to dismiss all religious experience as self-deception.</p>
                <p>Jung goes on to assert that it is Buber’s inability to understand how an ‘autonomous psychic content’ like the God-image can erupt into ego consciousness as a living experience. But he states that it is not for him as an empirical scientist to determine how such a psychic content may be dependent on the existence of a metaphysical deity. Jung goes on to ask which metaphysical deity Buber is citing - is it the God of the orthodox Jew or of the Christian? This is an unfortunate lapse on Jung’s part as Buber was, in fact, himself subjected to much criticism from orthodox Jewry for his views. Jung goes on to claim that he is convinced that Buber’s relationship to a divine ‘Thou’ is to that of an autonomous psychic content, which is defined one way by Buber and another by the Pope.</p>
                <p>Jung then addresses Buber’s criticism that God cannot exist apart from man even though the former has asserted that everything said about God is a human and therefore a psychological statement. Jung goes on to challenge Buber to demonstrate where there is an image of God that has not been made by humans. This archetype has been implanted by God in human beings’ psyches so that they may glimpse an image of the divine that originates in their own psychic substance. Unfortunately, theologians of different denominations have been seized by this archetype and are always at each other’s throats declaring their God to be the only true one.</p>
                <p>Jung says that he discovered the existence of this archetypal force as the result of human experience and that what satisfies him about it is that it is both human and ‘other’. Like all archetypes, it possesses great power and that is why it is essential that there is a dialectic between the ego and the other realm of the unconscious. The contents of the objective psyche are related to metaphysical ideas such as are found in Gnostic writings. It is on this misconception that Buber has formulated his criticism of Jung.</p>
                <p>Jung goes on to suggest that Buber visits a psychiatric asylum or studies the autobiographies of the mentally ill such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wisdom, Madness and Folly</em>, by John Custance, or the famous <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memoirs of My Nervous Illness</em>, by Schreber, that Freud analysed. In these Buber would see that metaphysical ideas are expressed which do not proceed from Gnostic hypotheses. Jung also says, in answer to Buber’s assertion that he has contributed to the ‘eclipse of God’ that what he has, in fact, pointed to is the withdrawal of projection. In other words, Jung states that if he claims that all statements about God have their origin in the psyche that does not mean that he is denying God or attempting to put man in God’s place.</p>
                <p>Faith is certainly a splendid thing if one has it, and knowledge by faith is perhaps more perfect than anything we can produce with our laboured and wheezing empiricism. (Jung, 1977: 668)</p>
                <p>Jung goes on to say that Christian dogma is of a higher order than the ‘wild’ philosophizing of the Gnostics and the scientific endeavours of the psychologist.</p>
                <p>[They] are the outcome of our daily labours in the sloughs of ordinary human existence and human pain. They are essentially irrational, and the philosopher who criticizes them as though they were philosophical concepts tilts against windmills and gets into the greatest difficulties, as Buber does with the concept of the self. (Jung, 1977: 668)</p>
                <p>Jung’s rebuttal is scathing in its tone throughout and not least at the end where he throws down the gauntlet to Buber and all the other theologians who baulk ‘at my odious psychology’ and says that they are welcome to try to heal patients with the word of God. The psychologist, on the other hand, has to deal with the grim realities of human nature and start from facts which need interpretation.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Critique of Jung’s Gnosticism</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Chapter 2 explored Jung’s interaction with Gnosticism through the work of Robert Segal. We will return to him now in order to highlight the profound difference between Jung’s approach and that of the Gnostics.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see why Jung felt that his approach had a great affinity with that of the Gnostics because their creation myths understood in his terms are to do with the development of the psyche. The godhead may be taken to symbolize the unconscious which prior to its emanations is a perfect whole and is hermaphroditic in the same way that alchemy portrays. It is the emergence of matter alongside the immaterial godhead which equates with the ego emerging out of the unconscious and the <em>divine spark</em> is the link to the godhead.</p>
                <p>For Jung, the unconscious was creative and spontaneously produced the ego, although in both systems the key paradox is why the godhead/unconscious strives to produce matter/ego which it then consistently tries to undo. The spontaneity of the process of creation is accompanied by its opposite wherein the godhead/unconscious continually tries to reclaim its creation. As a result, the ego struggles to be independent of the unconscious and when it achieves this it repudiates its origins. To quote Marie-Louise von Franz, every human is made up of:</p>
                <p>a pre-conscious totality in which everything is already contained, including consciousness . . . (and) an active tendency towards building up a separate consciousness, which, then, sometimes, in a Luciferian gesture, turns back to the pre-conscious totality and says: ‘I was not created by you, I made myself.’ (Segal, 1992: 22)</p>
                <p>According to Gnostic thinking, ignorance keeps humans enslaved to the material world while gnosis (knowledge) frees them from it. Knowledge itself is liberating in that revelation of a higher order automatically liberates one from the lower one. That knowledge can only come from the godhead and the dependence of humanity on it is equivalent in psychological terms to the ego’s dependence on the unconscious. Gnostic myths advocate total identification with divinity, which in the Jungian view would lead to a dangerous inflation where ego becomes identified with the self. At the very least this results in arrogance but can also lead to psychosis which, in turn, leads to the dissolution of the ego.</p>
                <p>The Jungian goal of individuation is not the rejection of ego consciousness in favour of the unconscious but to arrive at a balanced position between the two. In Gnosticism, the revelation necessitates forsaking the material world altogether. This is the central difference between the two paths and for Jung returning to the unconscious always has the goal of raising it to consciousness. As he says:</p>
                <p>Man’s worst sin is unconsciousness, but it is indulged in with the greatest piety even by those who should serve mankind as teachers and examples. When shall we stop taking man for granted in this barbarous manner and in all seriousness seek ways and means to exorcize him, to rescue him from possession and unconsciousness, and make this the most vital task of civilization. (Segal, 1992: 24)</p>
                <p>For Jung, the return to the initial unconscious state is a quest undertaken to elevate it to consciousness, whereas for the Gnostics that was the end goal. Conversely, for the Gnostics the ultimate search is for the undoing of the link between divinity and matter, as the latter is always seen as evil. In the Jungian approach, this would be tantamount to a negative dissociation of the unconscious from ego consciousness. ‘In sum, Jung’s progressive ideal is at odds with the regressive one of Gnosticism’ (Segal, 1992: 27).</p>
                <p>Further, Jung associates the godhead with the unconscious and God and Christ with the self. The opening up of a dialectic along the ego/self axis is the aim of Jungian analysis, not the toppling of one by the other. In this way the ego becomes supplemented by the self. In his studies of Gnosticism, Jung overlooked the fact that the return of the divine spark to the godhead is the goal which has been demonstrated and is quite other to that of Jungian therapy.</p>
                <p>The reason Jung misinterpreted Gnosticism was because he equated it with alchemy in thinking that the Gnostic process of liberating the immaterial sparks from matter were the equivalent of the alchemical process of extracting gold from base metals. On closer inspection one sees that the two processes are completely dissimilar as gold is produced out of metals whereas in the Gnostic system the sparks have fallen into, and are imprisoned in, matter and await release.</p>
                <p>For Jung in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em>, the godhead had to create the world in order to realize itself, so that creation is seen to be necessary and beneficial. It is the union of the two that is the ultimate in divinity. This is completely at odds with the Gnostic view that all creation is evil and that matter’s rediscovery of the godhead is an end in itself. From the Jungian standpoint, the Gnostic goal leads to inflation and not to individuation.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Rethinking has also taken place in the area of gender and three or four of these revisions will be briefly explored in this section. Further reading on the subject will be mentioned in the literature given at the back of the book.</p>
                <p>Jung and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the Feminine</em></p>
                <p>The starting point will be the American analytical psychologist, Beverley Zabriskie’s chapter in Renos Papadopoulos’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Carl Gustav Jung: Critical Assessments</em>. Zabriskie stresses the importance of gender in understanding the universe in a wide variety of disciplines ranging across mythology, geography, philosophy, history and many others.</p>
                <p>She claims that a fascination with the feminine existed in earlier agrarian times as witnessed by figurines from that time that attest to a veneration of the female body. Her hypothesis is that this was due to women being valued as co-equals in the work they could contribute to alongside men. Once territorial conquest became the dominant ethos, male qualities of aggression were emphasized and a split took place between the masculine, equated with civilization, and the feminine, with nature. ‘The son culture separated from the ancient Great Mothers’ (Zabriskie, 1992: 365). This meant that females became increasingly the supporters of others and lost their independent identity.</p>
                <p>To digress from Zabriskie for a moment, this shift from the importance of the feminine to that of the masculine has resulted in the former being symbolically castrated by the latter. Depth psychologists have described this in various ways; for instance, Freud as ‘penis envy’; Adler as the ‘masculine protest’ over ‘feminine weakness’; and Lacan as the ‘symbolic order’ which is associated with the phallic stage.</p>
                <p>Jung’s contribution to this was to equate consciousness and logos with the masculine and unconsciousness and eros with the feminine. She applauds Jung’s model of the <em>animus</em>, the archetype denoting the masculine principle, and <em>anima</em>, the feminine principle, and says that these enable the development of a balanced personality containing contrasexual elements. (New thinking has resulted in the revised concept of the yoked anima/animus seen to be part of every individual’s inner world.)</p>
                <p>According to Zabriskie, these creative ideas of Jung’s became reified when they entered analytical psychology and ‘became static. It is as if the archetypes fell into matter and reemerged as stereotypes’ (Zabriskie, 1992: 365). Her balanced pronouncement on Jung’s contribution to gender issues is that it has been both innovating as well as limiting, even damaging.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung and the Masculine</em></p>
                <p>John Beebe’s paper in the same book edited by Papadopoulos is on Jung’s attitude to the masculine. This started to become a focus for male analytical psychologists in the late 1980s, including Andrew Samuels, Peter Tatham and James Wyly.</p>
                <p>Beebe examines Jung’s childhood dream of the phallic eye (which is reproduced at length in Chapter 1 of this book). He concludes that in his early thinking, Jung associated masculinity with consciousness, thus excluding the feminine dimension. Only later, when developing the archetype of the hero and initiation, did Jung come to a more mature view of masculinity. In particular, the myth of initiation involves ‘the painful submission of the hero to the greater authority of archetypal forces with the power to mediate the development of consciousness’ (Beebe, 1992: 363). This is the giving up of the consciousness associated with the hero and its arrogant nature.</p>
                <p>This is an important insight into the paradox of the heroic stage which is, on the one hand, vital for leading the individual out of unconsciousness but must also be transcended for a further development of personality to take place. For a man, this must be accompanied by relationship to his anima that can enable him to relate to his masculine nature with ‘the right emotional attitude’ (Beebe, 1992: 364).</p>
                <p>Beebe also sees Jung’s earlier model of the Logos/Eros, discrimination/relatedness principles as inevitably leading to sexist rigidity, whereas the later, more mature formulation of the alchemical Sol and Luna which he developed when he was over 60 years old was ‘grounded in the experience of masculine individuation after midlife’ (1992: 365). This turning point led to the transformation of a rather naive image of anima as full of potential. It has, instead, now gone through the suffering of tears and bitterness and is capable of ruthlessness when necessary. ‘Luna is an initiated unconscious that is ready to interact with the initiated heroic consciousness that is Sol to produce the integration of personality’ (Beebe, 1992: 364).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Altehty</em></p>
                <p>Polly Young-Eisendrath states that Jung’s theory of contrasexuality ‘was cursed or blessed . . . with the Latin names of <em>anima</em> (for male contrasexuality) and <em>animus</em> (for the female counterpart)’ (Casement, 1998: 202) Jung described these as archetypes and not complexes (Young-Eisendrath posits them as being the other way around) and saw them as biological consequences of the archetypal feminine and masculine. He went on to categorize them as universally accepted expressions of difference between the sexes.</p>
                <p>Like Zabriskie, Young-Eisendrath criticizes the reifying of these terms into essentialist theorizing that led to sexual stereotyping and a formula based on complementarity. In this way, anima was split into an idealized feminine in being inspiring and life-giving or denigrated as negative hysteria and moodiness. A man could be talked of in this way as being in relationship to his anima or being in the grip of it.</p>
                <p>Animus, on the whole, comes across as mostly negative in Jung’s writings. It was Emma Jung who put forward a more positive view of it in describing it as a woman’s logos.</p>
                <p>In reducing Otherness, or <em>alterity</em>—the term used by Lacan - to a formula of complementarity, Young-Eisendrath condemns it as destructive of interest in and curiosity about one’s own contrasexuality, which can open up unknown aspects of personality.</p>
                <p>Anne Springer has also taken issue with Jung’s anima/animus model, suggesting that these are too comprehensive and define fundamental reciprocal bipolarity as normative. Sex and gender are mixed in an unspecified way (Young-Eisendrath’s criticism, too) and an inner and outer heterosexual couple becomes the ideal.</p>
                <p>Springer proposes that anima/animus are abandoned as constructs either as complexes or as archetypes and, in their place, advocates the following: ‘At most we should consider a striving for comprehensive emotional, affective, sexual and spiritual intimacy and encounter as archetypal’ (Casement, 1998: 195).</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Michael Fordham</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Two of the major rebuttals of classical Jungian ideas came from Jungian analysts themselves: Michael Fordham and James Hillman, both of whom stamped their own vision on analytical psychology. Fordham linked it to psychoanalytic, initially Kleinian ideas, which was the beginning of a fertile integration of psychoanalytic theory and practice with analytical psychology. This is reflected today in the way many Jungian analysts work around the world. At first, this approach was confined chiefly to the UK where it led to a split in the Society of Analytical Psychology (SAP) and the more ‘classical’ practitioners, who remained loyal to their vision of Jung, left. There have been several splits in the Jungian movement usually along what may thought of as a clinical versus mythological divide. Other factors, including cultural ones, play a prominent part in these splits in different parts of the world - not least the clash of different personalities.</p>
                <p>Hillman was equally revolutionary - though in a very different Way--in his revision, which has come to be called Archetypal Psychology. This will be elaborated further in the section below, which is devoted to Hillman’s ideas.</p>
                <p>Fordham was amongst the most creative analytical psychologists and one of the few to formulate his own approach to Jungian psychology. He was also the acknowledged leader of the Jungian movement in the UK. In 1933, he was introduced to analytical psychology by H.G. Baynes, a leading early British Jungian. Fordham was one of the few leading analysts of his generation who was not analysed by Jung and this may have had a lasting effect on him as he always appeared to be something of an outsider. On the other hand, they did have a long personal as well as professional relationship and it was Jung himself who selected Fordham to be the editor of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em>.</p>
                <p>Fordham thought that Jung’s work was complementary to and not in opposition to Freud’s and he began to steep himself in psychoanalytical ideas. He was particularly drawn to those of Melanie Klein, and his pioneering work was to integrate analytical psychology with psychoanalysis in a way which has since been fruitful for many Jungians.</p>
                <p>This section on Fordham will give one example of his theory and one of technique. Reference will be made to James Astor’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Michael Fordham: Innovations in Analytical Psychology</em>, as all of his main ideas are thoughtfully put together in that book. According to Astor, Jung was the inspiration behind all Fordham’s work and the latter also had a great respect for Mrs Jung of whom he said: ‘She very much had a mind of her own which was appreciative of but not subservient to that of her husband’ (Astor, 1995: 33). He was the first Jungian to interest himself in the child’s internal world and began to seek for origins of the self and individuating in childhood.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Primary Self</em></p>
                <p>From this vast store of experience Fordham built up from working with infants and children, he came to infer that the child’s ego developed out of the self. This led him to postulate that there was a <em>primary self</em> from which the ego emerged through contact with the environment. This meant that there was a self before there could be an ego. This is quite other to Jung’s thinking, which described the self and the ego as centres of integration within the individual but saw the self as coming into greater prominence in the second half of life after the mid-30s.</p>
                <p>According to Fordham, the primary self was an integrated whole but had a potential energy which in time contributed to ego development. The mechanism that drives this he called <em>deintegration</em> and <em>reintegration</em> and the parts of the self that deintegrated he termed <em>deintegrates</em> and these would retain aspects of wholeness. Examples of these are the hungry baby’s cry which contributes to its biological adaptation, or to the kind of imagery creation that contains potential symbolic meaning. In the former it is an objective manifestation and in the latter a subjective one. This theory is both a structural as well as a dynamic one.</p>
                <p>Fordham also moved away from notions of ‘the self to examining what he saw as part selves each felt equally to be ‘myself. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Syntonic Transference/Countertransference</em></p>
                <p>Fordham began his writings on transference in 1957, bringing in the kind of clinical phenomena that were missing from the Jungian literature up to that time. He differentiated between two kinds of transference - the dependent in which ‘repressed infantile contents are released’ (Astor, 1995: 104). When these have been attended to then ‘emergence of the self and its realization in consciousness’ can occur through analysis of the archetypal transference.</p>
                <p>He also discovered two kinds of countertransference: syntonic and illusory. The first describes the analyst’s experience of parts of the patient being projected into him, which can provide him with valuable information about the patient’s inner world. This necessitates the analyst being able to deintegrate so that parts of the analyst can spontaneously respond to the patient’s need. As these parts are manifestations of the self, Fordham extrapolated from these experiences with patients what Jung meant when he talked about analysis as a dialectical procedure:</p>
                <p>based on processes which neither I nor my patient can control consciously, and that analysis depends on the relatively greater experience of the analyst in <em>deintegrating</em> so as to meet the patient’s <em>disintegration</em>. (Astor, 1995: 113)</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Countertransference Illusion</em></p>
                <p>This applies to reactions aroused in the analyst by something that is taking place in the interaction with the patient that are to do with unresolved aspects of the former. Fordham cites a session with an 11-year-old boy in which he became aggressive towards the boy. As Fordham says, at that time in the session he ceased to be an analyst but was caught instead in an enactment. He realized as he allowed himself to get in touch with his own feelings that the interaction had briefly thrown him back to the time when he was a young boy with his mother.</p>
                <p>Cambray cites an instance of Jung exhibiting illusory countertransference defensiveness:</p>
                <p>A memorable example of this is his countertransferentially laden handling of the ‘normal’ doctor whose dream of discovering an idiot child smearing itself with feces alone in the middle of a large room, cause Jung to find a pretext to precipitously end the analysis and to provide an explanation of the dream ‘as something quite innocuous’, and gloss over all the perilous details. (Cambray, 2000: 18)</p>
                <p>Fordham’s work gave a practical application to many of Jung’s statements in relation to aspects of analytical theory, for instance the idea that the analyst is in the analysis, the self-regulating tendencies of the psyche, and the need to create a new theory for each patient. He also added vital new insights from psychoanalytic theory, particularly to do with the central importance of <em>projective identification</em> in the analytic work.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">James Hillman</h3>
                </header>
                <p>This section on James Hillman, an original thinker and poetic writer, will draw on two people’s work, as follows: Leon Schlamm, Lecturer in Religious Studies at the University of Canterbury in Kent, and David Tacey, Head of Psychoanalytic Studies at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
                <p>Schlamm’s lecture paper, ‘James Hillman’s School of Archetypal Psychology and Polytheistic Theology - Psychology and Religion’, states that Hillman’s Archetypal Psychology is the only really important attempt to present a post-Jungian interpretation of the inner life of human beings. Hillman is an original thinker and a poetic writer but both Schlamm and Tacey agree that Hillman is also a controversial figure - the former calling him a ‘black sheep’ in the Jungian community. Nevertheless, his work can only be understood in relation to Jung and his followers.</p>
                <p>Hillman shares in common with Nietzsche an antipathy towards monotheism and Christianity in particular and claims, instead, that the psyche is polytheistic. ‘According to Hillman, God is dead, but, he proposes, like Nietzsche, that the gods are alive’ (Schlamm, unpublished). For Hillman, Freud and Jung are monotheistic and the former established the ego as master in the psychic house. Jung, for all his talk of the collective unconscious and archetypes, is ultimately concerned with unifying them all under the power of the self. Consequently, Hillman rejects the path of individuation, which he sees as the heroic path of privileging one aspect of psyche over others. For Hillman, there is no salvation in individuation and he advocates, instead, the path of disintegration and pathology and of psychological pluralism. Taking up Jung’s famous dictum that the ‘gods have become diseases’, Hillman advocates a remythologizing of analytical thinking. ‘The necessity of pathologizing derives from the gods who show patterns of psychopathology’ (Schlamm, unpublished). The gods have been repressed and return as our <em>complexes</em> so that there is no cure for pathology but a need to re-evaluate it as divine.</p>
                <p>Schlamm illustrates the nexus between pathology and the divine by pointing to what Hillman has to say about hysteria—the starting point of psychoanalysis. For Hillman, the way in which the archetypal energy associated with Dionysus manifests in a distorted fashion as hysteria is because it has been repressed. In this way it manifests as the return of the repressed. Hysteria is generally associated with women just as the cult of Dionysus was—and it was hysteria in young women that initially led to the discovery of the unconscious.</p>
                <p>As the gods express themselves through images and fantasies, there is an emphasis on both of these in Archetypal Psychology. Also central to the latter is the idea of ‘soul-making’ by which Hillman means that through a process of deepening the images of the soul, the images of the gods may be experienced. This is why he stresses the power of the image itself over the search for a meaning behind the image. Jung placed tremendous value on imagery but was also a Kantian in distinguishing the phenomena of archetypal images from that which lies behind them—’the thing in itself. In this way, the concept of archetype becomes reified and, for this reason, Hillman prefers the term archetypal.</p>
                <p>Further, for Hillman, ‘living one’s myth’ does not mean living one myth but, rather, living myth as at any one time each individual is enacting many myths. The interested reader is directed to Hillman’s writings in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Myth of Analysis, Revisioning Psychology</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Archetypal Psychology</em>.</p>
                <p>In ‘Twisting and Turning with James Hillman’, David Tacey argues that Hillman’s work is primarily governed by two archetypal styles: ‘a “Hermes” pattern that insists on fluidity, openness and complexity, and an “anima” emotionality that produces high-flown rhetoric, extremism and dramatic reversals’ (Casement, 1998: 215). His declared mission is ‘soul-making’—a legacy from Neo-platonic ways of thinking.</p>
                <p>Tacey goes on to say that there is a tendency (with notable exceptions like the New York analyst Paul Kugler) in the Jungian world to ignore Hillman and to carry on as if his challenge to basic Jungian assumptions does not exist.</p>
                <p>Is this because Hillman destroys the Jungian ghetto that other Jungians want to cherish? Or perhaps the silence derives from envy, spite or contempt for the man who has constructed himself as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">enfant terrible</em> of the post-Jungian world? (Casement, 1998: 218)</p>
                <p>Hillman, for his part, has responded by declaring that ‘Jungians are not interested in ideas’ and are ‘second-rate people with third-rate minds’ (Casement, 1998: 218). The main thrust of Hillman’s critique of Jung himself stems from the former’s claim that ‘For Jung psyche is inside, whereas for our post-Jungian archetypal school, psyche is more out there in the world’ (Casement, 1998: 225). By this he means that archetypal psychologists are not interested in being shut up inside the head or shut out from the world.</p>
                <p>Tacey takes issue with him over this misrepresentation of Jung, as the latter, long before Hillman, was resistant to the idea of encapsulating psyche or soul within the human subject. Tacey suggests that Jung was postulating a kind of postmodern animism in his exploration of objective psychic experience which ‘reveals itself as a cosmos in its own right’ (Casement, 1998: 225). Also, Jung’s ideas on synchronicity, the acausal relating of human subjectivity and world events posits a continuum between inner and outer reality.</p>
                <p>An important area for both Jung and Hillman lies in their valuing of dream material but Hillman’s perspective is very different, eschewing as it does classical Jungian concepts about dreams as ‘compensatory’. Instead, he suggests that dreams emerge from an archetypal underworld which is completely other to the waking dayworld. He is not seeking to interpret dreams to add to an increase in consciousness but sees dreams as having a purpose of their own. As stated above, the focus in archetypal psychology is on imagery and the image itself.</p>
                <p>In 1993, Hillman launched an attack on psychotherapy in general with <em>We’ve Had a Hundred Years of Psychotherapy and the World’s Getting Worse</em>, in which he uses as the basis of his argument his claim that the modern age discovers the soul of the world through pathology and illness. This is, in fact, very close to Jung’s view that the gods have become diseases and that the deepest forces in the human psyche are manifested in neuroses and illness. Hillman’s pessimistic conclusion at the end of that book is: ‘By removing the soul from the world and not recognizing that the soul is also in the world, psychotherapy can’t do its job any more’ (Casement, 1998: 224).</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Miscellaneous</h3>
                </header>
                <p>The last part of this chapter will pick up on a few often-voiced criticisms of classical Jungian psychology.</p>
                <p>Jung proposed what he called the synthetic or prospective (promethean) approach as his way of conducting analysis which he opposed to what he denigrated as the reductive backward (epimethean) approach. A counter-argument sometimes put forward is to accuse classical Jungians themselves of being reductive—albeit in a different way, viz. that of reducing patient’s material to archetypes. Michael Fordham reported that Emma Jung remarked to Jung: ‘You know very well you are not interested in anybody unless they exhibit archetypes!’ (Astor, 1995: 50). In any case, the concept of transcendence should apply to the promethean/epimethean opposition as it does to all opposites.</p>
                <p>Another criticism has to do with the obfuscation on the part of some Jungian practitioners in relation to Jung’s typology (described in detail in Chapter 3). The terms themselves are easily susceptible to misinterpretation and, in particular, all kinds of fictions congregate around the <em>feeling</em> function. The latter, along with the <em>thinking</em> function, is a way of evaluating so that something is seen as being ‘good’ or ‘bad’, ‘nice’ or ‘nasty’, ‘beautiful’ or ‘ugly’. An individual whose bias is to a more thinking way of functioning will evaluate something, say an idea, as ‘interesting’ or ‘uninteresting’.</p>
                <p>The reason for particular confusion around the jargon-term ‘feeling’ is that the word ‘feeling’ has so many different connotations in English. For instance, ‘feeling’ in Jung’s sense of the term is often confused with being in touch with feelings - something that usually only comes about after the sort of epiphany that can occur from time to time in the course of an in-depth analysis. Alternatively, there may be an ‘Aha!’ moment in the course of living when something commonplace is suddenly experienced in a different way.</p>
                <p>‘Feeling’ is also often confused with emotion: a brief definition of the two is that feeling, in this sense of the word, is a subjective state that is internal and hidden from others that can extend over time (e.g. happiness, sadness and fear). ‘Emotion’ is an expression outside the organism which is time-limited and whose physiological correlates are changes in the heart-rate, the functioning of the viscera and the muscular system.</p>
                <p>The confusion around the feeling function extends to half-baked assertions along the lines that someone is <em>only</em> a ‘thinking’ or a ‘feeling’ type. How any actual human being could perform the remarkable feat of being able to evaluate in a purely thinking way without any feeling entering into the equation or vice versa is reminiscent of Portia’s dictum to Shylock that he may have his pound of flesh but without shedding a drop of blood. What appears as polarized in Jung’s early theory of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Logos</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eros</em> gave way later to a transcendence of opposites with his concept of the <em>androgyne</em>.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Critique of Dream Analysis</em></p>
                <p>Another Jungian analyst, and a close colleague of Fordham, Kenneth Lambert, criticized the classical Jungian approach to dream analysis. He identifies four areas that are problematic. One is to do with the fact that eliciting dreams from a patient can damage the spontaneous flow of material from the patient’s unconscious. Secondly, the analyst ends up being nothing more than an interpreter if the whole process becomes reduced to an abstract analysis of dreams. Thirdly, the introduction of dream material into the process may be a transference/countertransference <em>enactment</em>—i.e. dreams being produced out of compliance or conversely the withholding of dreams. Lastly, insufficient attention is paid in the classical approach to psychic mechanisms in dreams like projection or introjection. It is vital to bear in mind that it is the patient that needs to be analysed <em>not</em> the dream. (See what is said about dream analysis in Chapter 3.)</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychic Reality</em></p>
                <p>A trenchant criticism, echoing Hillman, comes from Marilyn Nagy, who says that Jung’s subjectivist argument for the validity of psychic contents <em>(psychic reality)</em> has brought positive but also unhappy results. She particularly applies this to the training institutes where critical thinking has been squashed in favour of ‘creating a kind of confessionalist atmosphere’ (Nagy, 1991: 32). The doctrinal position that is fostered by this militates against open enquiry and hard thinking: ‘a neglect of comparative research and the work of careful thinkers in related fields will eventually cost Jung’s followers the very trust which their emphasis on the experience of the individual seeks to earn’ (Nagy, 1991: 32).</p>
                <p>An exciting conference on Neuro-science and Psychoanalysis took place in London in July 2000. The speakers included Antonio Damasio, Oliver Sacks and Mark Solms and at the end of the weekend a new discipline was born: that of neuro-psychoanalysis. The neuro-scientists present put forward some of the discoveries that are taking place in that exponentially exploding field into the systemic workings of the mind/brain related to emotion/feeling/ mood. One of the great contributions of psychoanalysis is the concept of <em>repetition compulsion</em> in its encapsulation of much that is tragic but also heroic in the human condition. What happens in the brain of a human being at these times is susceptible to being corroborated neuro-scientifically. Jung already explored the related theory of complexes in his early years in psychiatry with the wordassociation test. An extension of this may be to explore the way they correlate with the networking functioning of the brain.</p>
