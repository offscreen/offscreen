                </header>
                <p>The prospective note at the end of the last chapter points us forward to researching the ways that Jung has had an impact on the world of psychotherapy and beyond. The take-up of his ideas has been widespread and every major figure in twentieth-century intellectual history refers to him. For instance, the founder of the behavioural movement, J. B. Watson, wrote a major criticism of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</em>. This book, along with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>, was a bestseller in the USA.</p>
                <p>The broadcasting of Jung’s ideas through his books has been one way that analytical psychology has played a key role in the evolution of twentieth-century psychotherapy. There are others and the professionalization of analytical psychology is a major way in which it has spread its influence around the world.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Professionalization of Analytical Psychology</h3>
                </header>
                <p>The professionalization of analytical psychology follows the historical evolution of all such movements which start with a charismatic figure leading a group of like-minded adherents. This might be called the vocational stage when the leader’s vision is shared by the first generation of disciples. The next important stage is the increasing coherence of the group and the setting up of a meeting place such as a club where like-minded people can foregather. As the enterprise begins to take on a more professional status, there is a growing need for some sort of demarcation in order to determine who are insiders and who outsiders. This leads to a need for greater institutionalization, which is followed by the setting up of training institutions and the putting in place of rules and regulations.</p>
                <p>This was the pattern that analytical psychology followed, although due to Jung’s much-vaunted dislike of institutions, the first training institutes did not come into being until after the Second World War and the founding of an international body, the International Association for Analytical Psychology (IAAP), which held its inaugural meeting in 1958.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Separation of Analytical Psychology from Psychoanalysis</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Zurich was an early centre for psychoanalysis and by 1912 a Psychoanalytical Association was in place that was connected to the Burghölzli Hospital and the University of Zurich. In 1912 the Zurich Psychoanalytical Association became an independent organization in separating from the Burghölzli and, in 1914, from the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA). From this time on, psychoanalysis and analytical psychology developed along their separate paths. The stated intention of the Zurich analytical psychologists in leaving the IPA was that they wanted to be free of what they saw as dogmatism and the authority of one man - Freud.</p>
                <p>The Zurich society was renamed the Association for Analytical Psychology and consisted, on the whole, of medical members who met once a week until 1918. At this time, it merged with the Analytical Psychology Club.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Zurich Analytical Psychology Club</h3>
                </header>
                <p>In 1913, the wealthy American, Edith Rockefeller McCormick, came to Zurich to be analysed by Jung and she increasingly began to practise as an analyst herself. It was due to a large financial donation from her that the first Analytical Psychology Club was founded in Zurich in 1916. According to Shamdasani, this was a lavishly furnished establishment that included a hostess, a cook, three servants and a workman (1998b: 21). The Club housed a consulting room, library, residential accommodation and a dining room and combined professional as well as social activities like billiards. Jung’s intention behind founding the Club was to overcome the restrictions of one-to-one analysis and he wrote to Alphonse Maeder—whom he wanted to be the first president—that ‘the experiment must be made’ (1998b: 25).</p>
                <p>Jung’s interests were broadening around this time and he was developing a general psychology as evidenced by his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</em>, which was being written around the same time. ‘If the Club for Jung was an experiment that had to be made, its outcome and enduring legacy was <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types’</em> (Shamdasani, 1998b: 27). There were, therefore, two goals in Jung’s mind when he decided to found the Club; these goals were based on professional and psychological aims.</p>
                <p>The Club was inaugurated on 26 February 1916, with formal statutes and an executive committee that included Emma Jung as the chair, while Jung never served on the executive, remaining always an ordinary member. The Club was for both professional and lay members but there was a quite separate meeting for professionals only and Jung was always aware that the two constituencies had quite different purposes. As he said about analysts: ‘They are people who are vitally interested in psychology while the lay people often merely indulge in a sort of lazy curiosity’ (Shamdasani, 1998b: 40).</p>
                <p>Jung’s views on the establishment of an ‘analytical collectivity’ are expressed in a handwritten circular letter. He says that one tendency is characterized by a rigorous conception of the principles of analysis; the other is characterized by the emergence of ordinary familiarity and social gathering. This gives rise to difficulties as the two tendencies live in a state of opposition to one another—a certain amount of which is an inevitable part of living but superfluous friction is to be avoided. He, therefore, advocated a better separation of both groups in the future with different floors reserved for each but allowing for mutual interaction. It was along this divide, in various parts of the world, that the professional wing of the Jungian movement always separated itself from lay members who would remain housed in the clubs. This was almost always a painful experience as the latter felt devalued.</p>
                <p>A fascinating contribution to Jung’s sixtieth birthday Festschrift volume by Emil Medtner, who was present at the inaugural meeting of the Club, is worth quoting here. Medtner was an important figure in the Russian symbolist movement and started an analysis with Jung in 1914. His article begins by saying that the idea of a psychological Club is so anti-Freudian that its existence alone would suffice as a demarcation between the two approaches. He goes on to say that outsiders imagine the relationship of Jung to the Club to be that of ‘an occult master, an ideological leader . . . the director of a school or even the head doctor of an insane asylum for already convalescing neurotics’ (Shamdasani, 1998b: 79). Far from this being the case, Medtner goes on to say that: ‘Jung is the first who would be pleased if it could be established that the Club, without becoming untrue to his idea as a psychological Club, did not let itself be taken in tow by him’ (Shamdasani, 1998b: 79). He also commends Jung’s prowess at billiards!</p>
                <p>The Zurich model was the one that repeated itself around the world with the starting point for analytical psychology in each city beginning with the founding of an Analytical Psychology Club.</p>
                <p>The merger in 1918 of the Association for Analytical Psychology with the Analytical Psychology Club led to regular lectures taking place and these, combined with analysis, were the training ground for the first generation of Jungian analysts. Most of the latter saw both Jung and Toni Wolff for analysis so that an analysand would have a session with Jung on one day and with Wolff on the next. Those analysts who had this experience said that he was excellent for archetypal work but Wolff was better on personal issues.</p>
                <p>The C.G. Jung Institute was founded in 1948 but it was only with the establishing of the IAAP that the requirement for becoming an analyst ceased to depend on having analysis with Jung followed by a letter of recommendation from him.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The International Association for Analytical Psychology (IAAP)</h3>
                </header>
                <p>This section is partly based on Thomas Kirsch’s account in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Jungians</em>. According to Jung’s close associate, C.A. Meier, on Jung’s 55th birthday in 1930, some of his close associates in Zurich persuaded him to think of forming an international professional organization. The International Association for Analytical Psychology (IAAP) was founded in that year and was structured according to Swiss law.</p>
                <p>Its founding aims were to promote analytical psychology; to accredit professional groups and individual members where the former did not exist; and to hold regular congresses. The aims and structures of the IAAP have, of course, evolved over time. The first president of the IAAP was Robert Moody, who was a member of the Society of Analytical Psychology in London, and the first international congress was held in 1958. This event happens every three years and at the first six international congresses the predominant number of attendants was made up of Swiss and British analysts. The first international congress to be held outside Europe was in 1980 in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>In 1980, the IAAP allocated funds to establish an annual newsletter, which came to serve as an important form of communication within the increasingly international community of the IAAP—at the time of writing, this includes 34 worldwide organizations with others in the process of being formed.</p>
                <p>Funds were also provided to set up a research committee some years ago. This is currently conducting research into the efficacy of analytical psychology in Berlin, San Francisco and Zurich, where major projects are under way.</p>
                <p>The IAAP has played a significant role in establishing analytical psychology as an international profession and the current president is the Italian analytical psychologist, Luigi Zoja.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Americanization of Jung</h3>
                </header>
                <p>The American connection was important for Jung from 1909 when he paid his first visit there with Freud and Ferenczi and Jung fell in love with the country. Part of that story has already been covered in Chapter 1, so this section will look at Jung’s specific experience of the USA and of how his influence continued to burgeon there, in one way or the other, throughout the century. Eugene Taylor’s book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shadow Culture: Psychology and Spirituality in America</em>, will be referred to in order to give some of the background to Jung’s experience in the USA.</p>
                <p>As a result of the word-association test, Jung had by 1909 gained an international reputation and the Swiss-born pathologist Adolf Meyer, working in the asylums in New York State, had introduced Jung’s work into the psychological literature. Meyer had been a student of Auguste Forel, who had held the Chair at the Burghölzli Hospital in Zurich before Bleuler and so Jung’s work had entered the USA through his Swiss connections.</p>
                <p>Taylor takes a similar view to Shamdasani in saying that many of Jung’s ideas came from the Trench-Swiss-English-American alliance’ (Taylor, 1999: 213). These included the <em>collective unconsciousness</em>, the comparative study of trance and mediumistic states and psychological types. In due course, many American physicians visited the Burghölzli Hospital; these included A.A. Brill, August Hoch and Frederick Peterson. Prominent Americans like Harold Fowler McCormick and Edith Rockefeller McCormick came to him as patients as did Fanny Bowditch, the daughter of the dean of Harvard Medical School.</p>
                <p>After the first joint trip with Freud to the USA in 1909, Jung returned several times. His next visit was in 1910 when he passed through New York <em>en route</em> to Chicago to consult with the McCormicks. In 1912 Smith Ely Jeliffe arranged for him to lecture at Fordham University where Jung presented his own theories, which were published later as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>. While he was in N ew York, he held seminars for psychiatrists at many institutions about which the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New York Times</em> printed a long story.</p>
                <p>In 1913 he visited the USA for the last time before the First World War and did not return for 12 years, during which time a Jung circle began to form in New York. More will be said about this later in the chapter where I deal with the institutionalization of the Jungian movement. Jung returned to the USA in 1924 when he visited New York, Chicago, the Grand Canyon, Taos in New Mexico, New Orleans and Washington, D.C.</p>
                <p>Two key figures in the history of American Jungian psychology were Henry Murray and Christiana Morgan. Murray was a physician and Melville scholar; Morganalay analyst and artist. Murray was a polymath and introduced psychoanalysis into academic psychology and literary criticism and the Thematic Apperception Test into clinical practice. Morgan was a beautiful and intelligent woman from a Boston Brahmin family on her mother’s side and a medical background on her father’s. Her trance visions helped her gain access to the deepest recesses of her feminity and the notebooks she kept formed the basis of Jung’s Vision Seminars.</p>
                <p>Although they were both married to other people, they embarked on an erotic, religious and intellectual quest together for 40 years, which devastated others and left many of their own aspirations unfulfilled. ‘They were both guilty of being too rich, too privileged, too narcissistic, and too absorbed in the overblown spiritual importance of their essentially illicit relationship’ (Taylor, 1999: 225).</p>
                <p>Murray’s influence enabled Jung to return to the USA in 1936 and on this occasion he received an honorary doctorate from Harvard University. Towards the end of his life, Jung came to feel somewhat embittered towards the USA as he eventually became overshadowed there by Freud. This was due to the fact that in the late 1930s, with the growing threat of Nazism in Europe, many psychoanalysts fled to the USA. Due to their influence, psychoanalysis increasingly infiltrated the American medical establishment and was in control of clinical teaching in psychology and psychiatry until recent times.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Humanistic and Transpersonal Psychology</em></p>
                <p>The dominance in the USA of psychoanalysis, on the one hand, and behaviourism, which controlled academic teaching departments of psychology, on the other, brought about a reaction in the 1940s and 1950s that culminated in the humanistic movement. This thrived between 1941 and 1969 in the academy attracting scholars from the humanities and social sciences. With the social and political upheavals of the late 1960s, humanistic psychology split into three parts, one of which was transpersonal psychology.</p>
                <p>One of the catalyst figures in the evolution of the new psychology was Abraham Maslow. He was a New Yorker who taught at Columbia and Brooklyn College, where he came in contact with the psychoanalysts Karen Horney and Erich Fromm. He only began to develop his own controversial ideas after the Second World War, which culminated in what he called ‘self-actualizing’ and applied to individuals who were able to achieve the highest and best of their potential.</p>
                <p>Maslow’s ideas came together with those of Anthony Sutich from Palo Alto, who was completely incapacitated by an accident and spent most of his life in a supine position. During his long periods of immobilization, he noticed that people came to talk to him about their problems and to seek his advice and this led to him deciding to become a psychotherapist.</p>
                <p>In 1949, Sutich and Maslow met for the first time and found that they shared an interest in growth-oriented psychology. They also had many colleagues with similar views and these included Rollo May, Carl Rogers, Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson. It was the coming together of Maslow and Sutich that led to the founding of Transpersonal Psychology in the late 1960s and they counted amongst their godfathers William James because of his exploration of mystical consciousness in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>. The term ‘transpersonal’ was inspired by James, who had used it during a Harvard course.</p>
                <p>Maslow and Sutich also counted Jung as a predecessor as they recognized elements of transpersonal psychology in his emphasis on <em>archetypes</em> and the <em>transcendent function</em>. Sutich launched the transpersonal movement in 1969 from northern California and its studies included phenomena like self-actualizing and transcendence.</p>
                <p>In California, humanistic and transpersonal psychologists have woven psychoanalysis around gender issues, theories and politics, with Jung having superseded Freud as the new guru of inner exploration, where meditation and transcendence take center stage with spiritual development in the therapeutic encounter. (Taylor, 1998: 111)</p>
                <p>Maslow, in his turn, was elected to the presidency of the American Psychological Association, which gave the establishment’s seal of approval to the humanistic and transpersonal psychology movement.</p>
                <p>The New Age Movement is also said to have adopted Jung as one of its godfathers. According to a 1998 book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought</em>, by the Dutch religious scholar, Wouter J. Hanegraaff, the ideas underlying this movement are Gnostic, Neoplatonist, alchemical, hermetic and occultist. These would, of course, have a great affinity with many of Jung’s ideas. However, Taylor is critical of this thesis and says it describes the European New Age not the specifically American one, which traces its unique character back to American religious consciousness.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Formative Impact of Jung’s Seminal Ideas</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Many of Jung’s ideas have passed into everyday usage—<em>extravert</em> and <em>introvert</em> are two that were mentioned in the Introduction. Others have been taken up and applied by psychiatry and psychology. This section will look in greater depth at those that have had a pervading influence. Some of the major ones have already been elaborated at length in preceding chapters such as alchemy, <em>active imagination</em>, dream interpretation, psychic energy, the <em>numinous</em>, the <em>transcendent function</em>, teleology, Trickster, complexes and <em>anima/animus</em> amongst others. I will elaborate below some of Jung’s other ideas that I am most frequently asked about, most of which have taken root in the collective consciousness one way or the other.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Archetypes</em></p>
                <p>Throughout the book there has been mention of Jung’s concept of archetypes and links have been made to the important sources that he drew from in developing this part of his ideas system. Briefly, they are the inherited part of the psyche that gives rise to patterned tendencies of thought. The American analytical psychologist, Murray Stein’s definition of the actual term archetype is that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">typos</em> means stamp and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">arche</em> means the original or master copy. Thus the psyche carries the mark of the archetype.</p>
                <p>Bi-polarity is inherent in archetypes and three archetypal pairings will be illustrated in order to flesh out Jung’s schema, in the course of which reference is made to definitions in John Beebe’s classificatory system.</p>
                <p>The archetype of the <em>hero/heroine</em> or <em>persona</em> is opposed to the <em>shadow</em> or opposing personality. The definition of persona is that it represents that aspect of an individual which is in relation to the outer world. It derives from the Greek word for ‘mask’ and denotes those masks that were worn by actors in performing comic/tragic parts in Greek plays. The less acceptable parts of the personality are kept hidden behind the persona. A well-differentiated person develops a well-fitting persona and the latter is essential for survival. Each individual has to deal with a variety of situations in the course of the day, for instance, being with loved ones, meeting the bank manager, managing a career, etc. An individual who cannot put on the right clothes for each occasion is at a disadvantage and may even be at risk - think of Marilyn Monroe in this context.</p>
                <p>The hero/heroine is often synonymous with the persona and Beebe suggests Heracles as the embodiment of the hero. On the other hand, Odysseus was a cunning ambiguous sort of hero who often lied and cheated and for this reason he may be identified with the <em>wounded hero</em>—i.e. one who bears the marks of his imperfections and may be equated with the therapist, who is able consciously to bear their vulnerabilities. For this reason, Odysseus and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Odyssey</em> are linked with Jungian therapy which holds the archetype of the <em>wounded healer</em> in a central position containing as it does the opposites of healing/fallibility.</p>
                <p>The shadow has already been elaborated in the course of the book but it is important to bear in mind that there is a personal shadow that is the repository of all the aspects of an individual that they are ashamed about and in denial of. There is also <em>archetypal shadow</em>, which is identified with the dark side of the self, which is here treated as an archetype. It is this archetypal shadow that Jung was referring to when he talked about the existence of evil.</p>
                <p>The next pairing is the <em>wise old man or woman</em> which is opposed to the <em>senex or witch</em>. The first part of the pairing is synonymous with the Good Father or Mother as portrayed in myths and fairytales—the former as Zeus, the latter as Mary or Demeter. This good parent nurtures and guides the person and is also an internal one being identified with positive aspects of the self. This may function in a quite unconscious way in an individual, acting to direct one away from a consciously driven position that is seen in retrospect to have been the better way. For instance, many people are ‘directed’ in this way to come into therapy and say when they first arrive that they have no idea why they are there.</p>
                <p>The opposite of the above, the senex/witch, is constellated in the image of the Terrible Father or Mother—there is a positive aspect to senex but what is being alluded to here is the dark side. Kronos, the Greek Titan, who ate his children and who foreshadows Herod’s slaughter of the innocents, is an example of the former. Kali, the creator/destroyer Terrible Mother, or the Medusa, the icycold petrifier, are examples of the latter. It is the witch’s voice that undermines an individual by whispering in their ear that they are hopeless and the pathological manifestation of this archetype is depression. The senex/witch is against all life and attacks both the soul and the spirit, however, Beebe also points to another aspect, which is its power to prick inflation and to act as an obstacle that may steer one in a more creative direction.</p>
                <p>The third pairing is the <em>puer/puella</em> which is opposed by the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Trickster</em>. The former signifies the eternal creativity of youth and is represented in myth as the birth of the divine child. Its attributes are spirituality, creativity, new beginnings and enthusiasm. The negative of this is remaining immature and irresponsible and being ungrounded. Many patients coming into Jungian therapy are caught in this archetype, as instanced by the individual who comes to a Jungian analyst seeking a mystical experience. The analytic task here will be concentrated on grounding such an individual through increasing ego strength while not damaging the creativity that comes from the puer/puella. What can happen in this kind of analytic encounter is that the patient and analyst may become polarized with the former identifying with the eternal youth and the latter becoming identified with the negative <em class="notranslate" translate="no">senex</em>.</p>
                <p>Narcissus is the god associated with the puer/puella and Icarus the mythological personification who, flying too close to the sun - in other words being inflated and ungrounded - melted his wings held together with wax and crashed down to earth.</p>
                <p>The Trickster has been encountered in the section above on alchemy and is synonymous with Hermes/Mercurius who can be both treacherous and humorous in enabling one to laugh at oneself. The Court Jester was a living example of the Trickster, who through wit and humour could tell the King painful home truths. The Trickster is above all the mediator and can bring the puer/puella into greater consciousness.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collective Unconscious</em></p>
                <p>Jung distinguishes between a <em>personal unconscious</em>, which is the repository of personal memories, repressed painful ideas and contents that are not yet ready to reach consciousness. He equates this with the personal shadow. The other kind of unconsciousness is of a quite different order and Jung called this the <em>collective unconscious</em>. This is the realm of the archetypes and of the ancient and universal ‘thought-forms’which are common to all humans. It is here that can be found the ‘hidden treasure upon which mankind ever and anon has drawn, and from which it has raised up its gods and demons’ (Jung, 1953b: 66).</p>
                <p>It is from the collective unconscious that everything irrational proceeds, whereas all rational contents are tied to the conscious mind. It is from this primordial realm that the challenge is thrown down as if by an interior enemy to the conscious attitude of the individual. In Jungian therapy the first task is usually concentrated on the personal parental images but once these have been worked through the real work begins on the archetypal parental images that belong to the realm of the collective unconscious. Jung felt that this latter task belonged in the second-half of life, i.e. after the mid-30s, and he says: No wonder that many bad neuroses appear at the onset of life’s afternoon. It is a sort of second puberty, another “storm and stress” period, not infrequently accompanied by tempests of passion - the “dangerous age” (Jung, 1953b: 75).</p>
                <p>This situation is often repeated in the therapist’s consulting room in both positive and negative ways. For instance, there is the person in their mid-50s who has never rebelled in youth and lives it in later life with the spouse/partner and family as the negative authority figures that must be overthrown. It may also be the time when a woman who has spent her life in service to parents/husband/children may be gripped by the sort of archetypal energy that can lead her on to a new path of career or relationship.</p>
                <p>When . . . psychic energy regresses, going beyond even the period of early infancy, and breaks into the legacy of ancestral life, the mythological images are awakened: these are the archetypes. An interior spiritual world whose existence we never suspected opens out and displays contents which seem to stand in sharpest contrast to all our former ideas. (Jung, 1953b: 77)</p>
                <p>These contents give rise to such intense feelings that millions may be captivated by them; here Jung cites the modern Gnostic systems of theosophy and anthroposophy because Christianity, unlike these two syncretistic movements, is incapable of attaining the richness of pagan symbolism which speaks to the powerful contents in the collective unconscious.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Archetypes and Instincts</em></p>
                <p>The American analytical psychologist, Murray Stein, has given an excellent account of the relationship between archetypes and instincts in his 1998 book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung’s Map of the Soul</em>. Although the two belong together, Stein states that Jung was not trying to reduce one to the other. Psyche exists in the space between pure body and transcendent mind and consciousness struggles ‘in a regular panic against being swallowed up in the primitivity and unconsciousness of sheer instinctuality’ (Stein, 1998: 101).</p>
                <p>However, psyche also resists being taken over by the transcendent end of the spectrum and so fluctuates between the instinctual pole and the archetypal spiritual pole. ‘Jung maps the psyche as a spectrum, with the archetype at the ultraviolet end and the instinct at the infrared end’ (Stein, 1998: 102). What usually happens in practice is that the two interact in the unconscious and unite to produce energized manifestations in consciousness such as ideas, strivings and urges. These two polarized opposites are located at either end of the psyche and it is there that lies the <em>psychoid</em>, or beyond psyche, areas which give rise to psychosomatic symptoms and parapsychological phenomena.</p>
                <p>Information from beyond the psyche passes from the psychoid realm into that of the collective unconscious and from there may surface into consciousness. The burden of choice is placed on egoconsciousness to deal ethically with these invasions from inner space’ (Stein, 1998: 103).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Self</em></p>
                <p>The self is the pivotal centre of Jung’s conception of the psyche and like his other key contributions it is one that he experienced first and later incorporated into his theoretical framework. For him, the self transcends the psychic realm, that is, it goes beyond and even defines it. Jung’s encounter with the self occurred during the years 1916 - 18 in the difficult time that followed his break with Freud in 1913. In the course of those two years he had direct experience of what he came to see as the bedrock of psychological wholeness, that which both keeps the psyche from falling apart at times of great stress but also transcends and goes beyond the psyche. He termed this the self.</p>
                <p>Jung fully elaborated his notions of the self in his 1951 book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aion</em>, which represents the collective aspect of the individuation process. It starts with simple definitions of the ego and the self where Jung warns of the danger of the former being assimilated by the latter. This results in the image of wholeness remaining in the unconscious as it is from the self that all ideas of wholeness and unity emanate. If the self is assimilated to the ego this results in inflation and grandiosity of the latter.</p>
                <p>The term Aion denotes an historical period of time and, in the book, Jung explores psychological development related to different signs in the Zodiac. For instance, the period from 0 to 2000 AD is the time of the fishes—the first thousand years being the time of Christ and the second thousand the time of the Anti-Christ. It is in this way that Jung related individual psychic development to what is in the collective psyche of any particular time. The symbols of the self are different at different historical epochs and like everything in life, symbols have their day and cease to be.</p>
                <p>Jung says that the self is a true ‘complexio oppositorum’ and has a paradoxical character. In this way, it is male and female, old and young, powerful and helpless, divine and demonic. It is both the totality of psyche and also the agent in its manifestation as the archetypal urge to coordinate, relativize and mediate the tension of the opposites. For Jung, the self is <em>the</em> organizing principle of the unconscious.</p>
                <p>As Jung’s personal encounter with the unifying power of the self happened in mid-life, he went on to theorize that this is experienced in the same way by everyone. As we saw in the section to do with Michael Fordham, the latter disputed this claim and went, on to formulate his own theory of self.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Individuation</em></p>
                <p>Jung’s term <em>individuation</em> applies to a deep inner coming together that symbolizes the union of consciousness with the unconscious. The figure of the <em>androgyne</em> has been cited as signifying this union that brings about a great increase in consciousness and an expansion of the personality.</p>
                <p>Andrew Samuels, Bani Shorter and Fred Plaut’s definition of individuation from their book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis</em> will be partly referred to. Jung took the term from Schopenhauer but it originates with Gerard Dorn, a sixteenthcentury alchemist.</p>
                <p>Paradoxically, on the one hand, individuation means becoming wholly and indivisibly oneself in distinction to others but, on the other, it also means gathering the world to oneself in order to fulfil collective qualities more completely and satisfactorily. What it definitely does <em>not</em> mean is any advocating of individualism or narcissism on the part of the person. Jung was himself an introvert and made most of his discoveries at a time of great introversion from 1913 - 18, which has led to interpreting him as giving greater value to the inner as opposed to the outer world. Even amongst some Jungian practitioners it is clearly thought to be ‘good’ to be an introvert as opposed to an extravert with the consequent advocating of a narcissistic withdrawal from the world. This is not what Jung meant by individuation.</p>
                <p>There are real dangers involved in the individuation process, one being the sort of inflation pointed to in the paragraph above. The other is that the path to <em>individuating</em> entails confrontation with the powerful forces that lie in the unconscious which, if not handled carefully, can lead to depression or even a psychotic episode. It is vital for anyone setting off on this path to build up sufficient egostrength to try to ensure that they can withstand emanations from the unconscious realm.</p>
                <p>To continue in this vein, it is as important to define what individuation is not as it is to point to what it is. It is, for instance, often confused with <em>integration</em> but is, in fact, quite different from it. Briefly, integration is ego-driven and relates to an expansion of consciousness through the assimilation of the personal shadow and the working through of ego-defences like <em>denial, projection, repression</em>, etc.</p>
                <p>The individuation process is driven by the self and its motivating force is Jung’s concept of <em>compensation</em>, which is the fundamental motivating principle between consciousness and the unconscious. As has already been said in another part of this book, once the ego achieves sufficient autonomy, there is a tendency on its part to want to forget its ‘lowly’ origins in the unconscious. This can lead to a split with the ego becoming dissociated from the unconscious followed by concomitant neurotic symptoms. Although these appear in a negative form, they are harbingers of the individuation process which, if attended to, can lead to the healing of the split. Jung was known to have said of someone: ‘Thank God he became neurotic’ This is the psyche’s way of signalling that there is an imbalance between consciousness and the unconscious and the consequent need for greater balance.</p>
                <p>At this point, people often come into therapy and, in the Jungian approach, the analyst is as much in the therapy as the patient. This was illustrated in the section on the archetypal transference/countertransference and alchemy. Images of the self will manifest at this time as contents from the collective unconscious begin to invade the conscious mind. These may appear in dreams in the form of <em>mandalas</em>, which take the shape of a circle enclosed by a square and which occur in the religion and art of many diverse cultures. They also appear frequently in alchemy. The process once started is likely to take a long time and this is the reason why an in-depth Jungian analysis is of lengthy duration. The question that is increasingly asked is whether long analyses are necessary or even beneficial. Jung’s answer is as follows: . . small and invisible as the contribution may be it is yet a <em>magnum opus</em> . . . The ultimate questions of psychotherapy are not a private matter—they represent a supreme responsibility’ (Jung, 1954: 234).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Stages of Life</em></p>
                <p>For Jung, the individuation process was linked to the second half of life so it is important to give an outline of what he meant by the stages of life. He divides these into two and posits that the first half stretches from puberty to somewhere between 35 and 40 years old. Prior to that, childhood is a time of complete dependence on parents and it is as though the child is not yet completely born but remains still enclosed in the psychic space of its parents. As we saw above, this was contested by Michael Fordham from his considerable experience of working with children.</p>
                <p>The tasks of the first half of life include the separation from the mother and the development of a strong ego. This comes about by acquiring an adult identity in a variety of ways that includes forming relationships, possibly culminating in a permanent pairing with another and/or producing children. The development of oneself as a social being is also the task of this life stage through further education, pursuing a career and the establishment of a way of life.</p>
                <p>The transition to the second half of life appeared always traumatic to Jung and is accompanied by depression in men around 40 years old but somewhat earlier in women. This theory, along with his one on the development of the self, was clearly influenced by his personal experiences. For him, the goals of the second half of life are different to the first which are orientated to outer achievement. In the second half, the libido changes direction and is orientated inwards to the unification of the ego with the unconscious. It is here that a person’s unrealized potential lies in the increasing opening up of the ego-self axis. According to Jung, the second stage is also the time of preparation for death.</p>
                <p>While finding Jung’s two life stages somewhat limiting, I think his hypothesis contains the seeds of a creative way of thinking about life as a series of stages to be negotiated. Through increasing experience of working with individuals in therapy, I have come to see that there are in fact many ‘stages of life’ and I invariably find that a person has come into therapy expressing feelings about ‘being stuck’. This usually means that they are caught in that liminal place between one stage and the next. It is this liminal space that Murray Stein so aptly identifies with Hermes when everything is in flux and giving rise to anxiety and panic attacks.</p>
                <p>My own thinking has for a long time concentrated on the vital significance of rites of passage rather than life stages, as it is at these times of fluidity that rituals are needed and therapy is above all <em>the</em> ritual of modern and postmodern times. I conceptualize the whole of a long therapy as a major rite of passage, with each session as a minor one entailing, as it does, a rite of entry, followed by the ritual that takes place in the course of the session and, finally, the rite of exit when the person has to put on the appropriate persona in order to face the outer world.</p>
                <p>The most profound rite of passage for a woman is the one associated with working through the menopause. This is often accompanied by experiences of social death, for instance the loss of a spouse/partner, children leaving home and the fear of being less attractive. If this rite of passage can be successfully worked through, it can open up the way to the most productive stage for a woman in which she can at last come into her own and take control of her individual life.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Synchronicity</em></p>
                <p>Jung was a border raider <em>par excellence</em> and he loved nothing better than pushing at the edges of what is already known. Murray Stein’s work will be used as the reference point for Jung’s theory of <em>synchronicity</em>. As Stein says, Jung’s theorizing about the psychoid led him to develop a single unified system that not only encapsulated both matter and spirit but also created a link between time and eternity.</p>
                <p>Random events, chance and chaos held a fascination for him and he noted that they often display a meaning for which there is no causal explanation. For him the hexagrams of ‘I Ching’, in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chinese Book of Changes</em>, sometimes display a pattern of meaning that can link current events to an unfolding pattern in the future. It was to try to throw light on how these meaningful patterns can happen without a known cause that Jung embarked on his theory of synchronicity, what may be thought of as meaningful coincidence or an ‘acausal connecting principle’.</p>
                <p>An example of this kind of synchronization of inner and outer events is an incident he experienced in a session with a patient. The latter had a dream of a gold scarab beetle which they were discussing in Jung’s study when there was a noise at the window, which turned out to be a local version of the beetle trying to get into the room. Jung inferred from incidents like this that archetypal images in dreams may coincide with outer events. His explanation was that as archetypes are not limited t o the psychic realm they can transgress boundaries and manifest in the outer world. Jung applied the term synchronicity when inner and outer simultaneously come together. Jung conjectured that synchronicity often occurs when there is an <em>abaissement du niveau mental</em>—a sort of lowering of consciousness - at which time unconscious contents become more active.</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em> have many references and allusions to the <em>unus mundus</em>—the unified cosmos—and to the idea of synchronicity and Jung collaborated with the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, to explore a possible relationship between nature and psyche. Jung also published an essay: ‘Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle’, to elucidate his thesis that: ‘There is a dimension in which psyche and world intimately interact with and reflect one another’ (Stein, 1998: 202).</p>
                <p>In this paper, Jung introduces the idea that synchronicity, along with space/time and causality, may be a new paradigm that can be used to give a complete account of reality as it is experienced by human beings and measured by scientists. In this way, he brings the psyche into the forefront of reality by stating that ‘the meaningful coincidence between a psychic event and an objective event’ must be taken into account.</p>
                <p>Jung was aware that the kind of perspective he was proposing makes huge demands on the Western mind, which thinks along strictly rational lines and, as Stein himself says: ‘The Age of Enlightenment left a legacy of facticity without meaning’ (Stein, 1998: 216).</p>
                <p>The key word there is <em>meaning</em> and Jung’s point is that the question of meaning requires answers that do not solely take into account the causal sequence of events. Along with Pauli, he worked out a diagram to try to do just that. It is in the form of a cross with the vertical line meeting with the horizontal in the middle. Along its vertical spine runs the space/time continuum and along its horizontal arm the causality/synchronicity continuum. The advantage of this model is ‘that it makes possible a view which includes the psychoid factor in our description and knowledge of nature - that is, an a priori meaning or “equivalence”‘ (Stein, 1998: 216).</p>
                <p>Jung had to expand his theory of the nonpsychic nature of archetypes in order to bring them into line with synchronistic events that transgress the boundaries of the psychic world. For this reason, he introduced the idea of the <em>transgresivity</em> of archetypes to cover that aspect of them that goes beyond the psychic and can occur in the physical world. This term points to the idea that patterns that occur in the psyche are related to those that lie outside of it: ‘the archetypes are not found exclusively in the psychic sphere but can occur just as much in circumstances that are not psychic’ (Stein, 1998: 218).</p>
                <p>Stein speculates as to how this might be applied to a coming together of instinct and archetype. For instance, a sexual instinct might become activated by causal events i.e. genetic factors and early childhood experiences and also because an archetypal field has been constellated. In this way, a chance encounter might turn into a life-long relationship.</p>
                <p>Why such connections take place seems a mystery if we reflect only upon causality, but if we introduce the synchronistic factor and the dimension of meaning we come closer to a more complete and satisfying answer . . . Falling into the archetypal world of synchronistic events feels like living in the will of God. (Stein, 1998: 219)</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Typology</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Typology, as Jung developed it, has already been elaborated as an historical and theoretical construct in Chapter 3. On reading <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</em>, the long book that is devoted to typology, one is struck by the fact that nine-tenths of it are devoted to historical associations. The reason for this is that, in Jung’s view, psychology had to be historical in order to be relevant. The return to typology in this section is to illustrate a couple of revisions of it as a theory and to demonstrate its application in two different ways.</p>
                <p>It would be in order to revisit the basic assumptions that underlie the theory which states that there are two attitudes - extraversion and introversion—and four functions—thinking, feeling, intuition and sensation. The first two of these are the rational functions and the second two the non-rational ones. Jung went on to postulate that the superior function had its opposing inferior function in the one at the other end of a vertical spine. So that if an individual’s superior way of functioning was thinking their inferior function would be feeling. If these two are polarized opposite each other on a vertical spine, then the other two non-rational functions would be along a horizontal arm with, say, sensation as the auxiliary and intuition as the tertiary function. Added to each of these would be their associated attitudes of extraversion or introversion.</p>
                <p>Beebe’s model proposes a second quaternity of functions that says that the first one is ‘ego-syntonic’ but the second is ‘ego-alien’. This then gives eight functions for each individual. He further proposes that if a function is extraverted its opposite will be introverted. Beebe came upon this way of conceptualizing as a result of a great deal of experience of typological analysis.</p>
                <p>In order to clarify this model, let us look at each set of four as follows. In the ‘ego-syntonic’ quarternity there is first <em>extraverted thinking</em> as the superior function; opposite is the fourth <em>introverted feeling</em> function along the vertical spine; the horizontal arm carries, on one side the auxiliary of <em>introverted sensation</em> and, on the other, the tertiary <em>extraverted sensation</em> function.</p>
                <p>In the ‘ego-alien’ quaternity, the attitudes associated with each of the functions will be inverted as follows: introverted thinking as the fifth function at the top of the spine with extraverted feeling as the eighth at the bottom. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Extraverted sensation</em> is the sixth function at one end of the arm and <em>introverted intuition</em> at the other end as the seventh function.</p>
                <p>Beebe links these eight to his archetypal pairings that were outlined in the section above. For instance, in the ‘ego-syntonic’ quaternity delineated above, the superior function of extraverted thinking would link to the archetype of the hero/heroine and would be the consciously achieving function. As it is the closest to consciousness, it would be closely related to the individual’s ego and persona.</p>
                <p>The introverted thinking function is still closely related to the individual’s conscious identity but because of its introverted orientation, it is closer to the self than the superior extraverted thinking.</p>
                <p>The second or auxiliary function is related to the archetypal pairing of the Good Mother/Father and will be used by the individual to take care of others. The third fuction is linked to the puer/ puella pairing and will be a source of creativity. The ‘ego-syntonic’ quarternity continues on in this vein.</p>
                <p>Let us turn now to the ‘ego-alien’ quaternity and look at the fifth function, which is the shadow of the hero/heroine. This opposes the individual’s heroic myth and results in a refusal to get into life. The example Beebe gives is of Achilles sulking in his tent as this opposing personality manifests in passive-aggression, suspiciousness, avoidance, etc.</p>
                <p>The. sixth function is identified with the witch/senex archetype and is the negative parent that attacks the person relentlessly in a shadowy underhand manner telling them that they are hopeless, stupid and will never get anywhere. The seventh function lines up with the Trickster, which fools and confuses the individual and others in their vicinity. It manifests as what Gregory Bateson called double-binding where an enforced choice always results in getting it wrong; or a confusing of Matte-Blanco’s with asymmetrical thinking.</p>
                <p>Lastly, comes the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Daimonic/Demonic</em> eighth function which can completely subvert the individual and others. This is such a vitally important theme it is worth elaborating it further. The American existential psychologist, Rollo May, used the classical Greek idea of the <em>daimon</em> to depict any natural function which has the power to take over the person. Examples of this are sex, the craving for power and rage. The daimonic is at the creative pole and the demonic at the destructive pole.</p>
                <p>May is, of course, talking about an archetypal way of functioning and it was this that Jung encountered at the time of his descent into the unconscious in the daimonic figures of Philemon, Salome and the serpent. These figures from the collective unconscious were Jung’s guides into the depths of his psyche and to a relationship with the powers that lie hidden there. It was thought by some scholars that in antiquity Plato and Homer used the term daimon as though it were synonymous with God. This is disputed by scholars who say that daimon alludes to something amorphous, indeterminate and incorporeal; whereas <em>theos</em> referred to the personification of a god like Zeus or Apollo.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, all that is daimonic lies between the mortal and the immortal and functions to communicate messages from the gods to humans. Beebe’s own definition is as follows:</p>
                <p>The <em>daimon</em> refers to a deeply instinctive, archetypal part of personality that asserts itself autonomously as a force for good or evil (and often both) through its strongly delivered intentions that undermine the adaptation of the psyche in both destructive and creative ways. The <em>daimon’s</em> style (on a continuum from raging to loving) defines the most problematic aspect of human character. It forms the built-in moral limit of any psyche, for it is the paradoxical dark spirit of the person’s unconscious will, with which the person’s soul <em>(anima/animus)</em> must struggle. Out of the encounter with the <em>daimon</em> emerges ‘the problem of evil’, because what is most difficult in character is also potentially what is most healing. In fact, the <em>daimon</em> is an autonomous spiritual complex that links the individual to divinity, itself a <em>complexio oppositorum</em> of light and dark energies. (Personal communication)</p>
                <p>The creative outcome of Beebe’s model of typology is that it brings together relational aspects with archetypal ones which may also be applied to the therapeutic situation. Beebe notes that if there is a marked difference in the therapist and patient’s type profiles this will, most likely, result in a ‘stormy, quarrelsome transference/countertransference’ therapeutic relationship. What is worse, the two may become caught together in their demonic functions and the end result is the sort of therapy that goes tragically wrong for both parties. This applies equally to any other relationship - one has only to think of the horror stories that emanate from the divorce courts!</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - III</em></p>
                <p>A classificatory test used in psychology and one in psychiatry will be briefly investigated next; the first has many of Jung’s original hypotheses built into it and the second is claimed to have strong affinities with them.</p>
                <p>The typology test used in psychology is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). This test led to a re-evaluating of an individual’s typology in a systematic way by identifying three implications in Jung’s original theory: one is the constant presence of the auxiliary function; second, the important result of combining perception and judgment - the MBTI terms that replaced ‘rational’ and ‘irrational’ in the original; and, lastly, the role of the auxiliary function in balancing extraversion-introversion.</p>
                <p>The final scale of the test endeavours to show how a perceiving type orientates to life in a different way to a judging one. For instance, perceiving through sensing and intuiting is shown to lead to a flexible, spontaneous approach to life. Individuals who are primarily perceiving types will stay open to experience and be comfortable with their ability to adapt to the exigencies of the moment.</p>
                <p>Individuals who are orientated to a more judging approach through thinking and feeling tend to live in a planned and orderly way and try to regulate and control their environment. They also tend to be structured and organized and decisions taken by them will lead to closure. It is important to bear in mind that ‘judging’ used in this context does not imply ‘judgmental’ as any of the types may be prone to the latter.</p>
                <p>Jung himself originally connected typology with psychopathology and Soren Ekstrom’s study of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - III (DSM-III) used in American psychiatry, linked this psychiatric classificatory system with Jung’s typology. Ekstrom compared eight maladaptive traits described in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</em>, with eight characterological disorders in the D S M and found a striking degree of overlap. This study is to be found in Renos Papadopoulos (1992), which includes a critique of it, but Ekstrom holds firm to his thesis.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sandplay</h3>
                </header>
                <p>At the time of his confrontation with the unconscious, Jung went through a period of playing in sand along the shores of Lake Zurich. Sandplay grew out of that and is a form of <em>active imagination</em> and non-verbal therapy. A tray is utilized and has to be 28.5 ÷ 19.5 inches with a depth of 3 inches and a height of 30. The inside is painted blue to signify sea or sky and two trays are provided—one filled with wet and the other with dry sand. According to Dora Maria Kalff, its founder in the 1950s, the tray is a ‘free and protected space’ (Kirsch, 2000: 233). The therapist is a participant observer in the process and may make interpretations but passes no judgment on the quality of the sand pictures.</p>
                <p>Sandplay can be a means of evoking archetypal material that can open the way to analytical work; for others, it can be a way of freeing oneself from the need for language. Apart from being practised by a number of Jungian analysts, it has been taken up worldwide in a variety of arenas, including schools and family therapy and acts as a bridge between East and West. The distinguished Japanese Jungian analyst, Hayao Kawai, is a strong supporter of the technique and when I was in Japan in 1995, there were approximately 14 Jungian analysts, a few more psychoanalysts and more than 400 sandplay therapists.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Academy and Research</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Jung wrote books more than he propounded theories and his writing style may best be likened to quasi-automatism akin to the inspirational writing of Nietzsche’s in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ecce Homo</em>. One is aware when reading Jung that he starts off without any idea of where he is going and ends up far from his starting point. The fact that he is not interested in creating meta-narratives gives his writings a distinctly postmodern edge. On the other hand, what has worked against him in the academy is the non-secular bias of his psychology, which is unacceptable in a secular age. Jung shares in common with Nietzsche the fact that they are both what might be called ‘psychologized Protestants’.</p>
                <p>The situation is changing and there is a growing interest in Jung’s ideas in academie as, increasingly, Jungian psychology is represented on university curricula.</p>
                <p>Jung was himself a Professor at the National Scientific University in Zurich as was his successor, C.A. Meier. Currently, the analytical psychologist, Verena Kast, is an Associate Professor at the University of Zurich so that Jungian thought is represented on the curriculum there.</p>
                <p>The University of Essex in the U K , where Renos Papadopoulos and Andrew Samuels jointly hold the Chair in Analytical Psychology, has established analytical psychology as an academic discipline. This writer is one of the team assembled by the two professors to offer tuition in postgraduate courses and the university produces public lectures and carries out research in analytical psychology.</p>
                <p>The situation in the USA has already been touched on in the section above. In his book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Jungians</em>, Thomas Kirsch reports the following individuals being active in American academe. In 1941, the Jungian analyst, Joseph Wheelwright became an instructor at the Langley-Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute which is part of the University of California Medical Centre in San Francisco. He taught analytical psychology to psychiatric residents and psychologists for more than 30 years and many Jungian analysts have succeeded him as instructors at Langley-Porter.</p>
                <p>Joseph Henderson followed a similar path at Stanford Medical School where he gave dream seminars to psychiatric residents for 15 years. When this School moved to Palo Alto, Thomas Kirsch continued the tradition of teaching for 30 years and there are many other Jungians on the staff of Stanford.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Two examples of how Jungian ideas are at work in widely differing cultures around the world will be given from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Post-Jungians Today</em>. The first is by the Brazilian analytical psychologist, Roberto Gambini, whose paper I summarized in the Introduction.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Brazil</em></p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Challenge of Backwardness</em>, by Roberto Gambini, is a profoundly moving but a l so disturbing account of the traumatic history of Brazil, a country belonging to what is called the developing world.</p>
                <p>For Gambini, there is an imbalance in his country’s psyche and he uses an in-depth synthesis of the archetypal, alchemical and astrological—which give so much meaning to the Jungian approach—to analyse Brazil. He turns to Jung’s work, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Axon</em>, to point to the convergence of the Renaissance and the Discovery (Invasion) of Brazil by the Portuguese in 1500. The ‘discovery’ of the New World represents an archetypal encounter of two contrasting parts of humankind which culminated in the climax of its achievement for one culture and the loss of the ancestral soul for the other.</p>
                <p>The alchemical synthesis that could have happened between European and Amerindian ways of being was replaced, instead, by the domination of one polarity over the other. Brazil has no myth of origin and the myths that belong to the indigenous people, to do with incest, hunger, danger, and meaning in life, have been completely subjugated to the dominant European ethos. It is now for the therapists to do the soul work of rehabilitating the mythology of their native land. This is part of the individuating process where the quest is for the Other and, in the case of Brazil, the Other is the Indian - literally and symbolically.</p>
                <p>There is reference to Levi-Strauss’s work with Amerindian myths - who was himself so profoundly influenced by Jung’s ideas - and a plea to restore the repressed and denied Indian part of the Brazilian psyche to consciousness. In this way, the ancestral soul/anima may be revived and from the rich genetic pool or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">prima materia</em> that makes up Brazil’s population the alchemical quintessence may be extracted.</p>
                <p>Japan=</p>
                <p>The Japanese analytical psychologist, Hayao Kawai, has written a great deal about his own struggle over many years to transcend the opposites of Japan , on the one hand, and Western culture, many aspects of which he has assimilated, on the other. For this reason, he is uniquely placed to address the subject that he wrote about for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Post-Jungians Today</em>, in his paper called ‘Splitting: resolved or reserved?’</p>
                <p>Kawai extrapolates the growing phenomenon of splitting and multiple personality disorder (MPD) from this kind of cultural identity problem which is greatly on the increase in the postmodern age. He warns against treating MPD by trying to integrate the different personalities as this can lead to renewed splitting on the part of the patient. As a result, he is against constellating the <em>hero archetype</em> in order to subjugate all of the other parts of the personality and he looks to fairytales to provide material for alternatives to the modern concept of the ego.</p>
                <p>The psychological mechanism of splitting leads to experiencing life as a half person and Kawai describes the motif of half persons in fairystories from Japan and Italy. In doing so, he explicates the idea of an individual being led into temptation through the voice of prohibition by a supraordinate power. He concludes that the world is full of half people, that is, people living with a split consciousness, and goes on to say that splitting not only brings about crises but can also help in negotiating them.=</p>
                <p>Kawai warns that if the therapist seeks to <em>resolve</em> the split in the therapeutic encounter, he may set up a split between himself and the patient with the two becoming polarized as the good therapist/bad patient. Kawai suggests instead that it is more helpful for the therapist to <em>reserve</em> or act as a container of the split. This can eventually lead to its transformation in the process of self-realization.</p>
                <p>Man and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">His Symbols</em></p>
                <p>The aim of this book has been to communicate some of Jung’s complex ideas and the broad scope of his interest in and contribution to a wide variety of areas. These latter include psychology, religion, psychiatry, anthropology, physics, philosophy and sociocultural issues. Throughout the twentieth century, Jung’s ideas have seeped into every sphere and many of his terms are in everyday usage. In my experience, there is a growing interest in Jung and I am increasingly asked to recommend reading-matter that makes his ideas more accessible—sometimes by people who do not know that I am an analytical psychologist.</p>
                <p>This July I heard the psychoanalyst, Michael Eigon, speak in Dublin and, over the course of an hour, he poured forth a brilliant alchemical medley that incorporated Meister Eckhart, Matte-Bianco (the Infinite is here to stay) and Kerouac, amongst others. When I talked with him after and mentioned that I was a Jungian analyst, his face broke into a delighted grin as he took my hands in his and said: º love Jung!’</p>
                <p>It feels right to wind down with a short account of how Jung’s last book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Man and His Symbols</em>, came into being. This has a long introduction by Jung in which he puts forward some of his life-long ideas on dreams, symbols, archetypes, typology and the soul. Other chapters include contributions by Joseph Henderson, Marie-Louise von Franz and Aniela Jaffe.</p>
                <p>In 1959 Jung agreed to be interviewed by John Freeman for the BBC. According to Freeman, the interview was to be done ‘indepth’, in the course of which a warm personal relationship developed between himself and Jung. The programme was deemed a success and Jung received a great deal of correspondence which pleased him greatly as much of it was from people with whom he would normally not have had any contact. One viewer was the managing director of Aldus Books, who asked Freeman if he would suggest to Jung that the latter put down some of his most important ideas in a way that would be accessible to the non-specialist.</p>
                <p>Jung met with Freeman and listened carefully to this suggestion, eventually responding with a polite but firm ‘No’. However, this was not to be the end of the matter. As we have seen, dreams have always figured prominently in Jung’s life, particularly at significant moments. The meeting with Freeman was followed by a dream where Jung found himself ‘standing in a public place addressing a great multitude of people who were listening to him with rapt attention and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">understanding what he said’</em> (Jung, 1968: vii).</p>
                <p>As a result, he allowed himself to be persuaded to write the book. According to Freeman, Jung devoted the last year of his life almost entirely to it and completed his part of it only 10 days before his final illness and death in 1961. Freeman expresses it as follows:</p>
                <p>At the very end of his own life, which was as full, rich, and happy as any I have ever encountered, he decided to use the strength that was left to him to address his message to a wider public than he had ever tried to reach before. He completed his task and his life in the same month. This book is his legacy to the broad reading public. (Jung, 1968: xii)</p>
                <p>The BBC interview itself contained a quote from Jung that has reverberated through the Jungian community ever since. Perhaps what has been written in the foregoing pages will help to illuminate for the reader what Jung may have meant when, in answer to Freeman’s question of whether he believed in God, he replied:</p>
                <p>Now? Difficult to answer. I <em>know</em>. I don’t need to believe. I know.</p>
