                    <h1 class="notranslate" translate="no">2 Jung’s Major Theoretical Contributions</h1>
                </header>
                <p>There were a myriad formative encounters in Jung’s life, some of which have already been delineated in the foregoing chapter. These also played an important part in the development of his theoretical formulations. Jung was a complex man who immersed himself in a great many disciplines and it is beyond the scope of this book to deal with all of them. As a result, a selective choice has been made as to which to include. Two of the most important were medicine, particularly psychiatry and psychology and have already been dealt with in the first chapter.</p>
                <p>Another important formative discipline was philosophy. Hand in glove with this, he also turned to more esoteric sources, such as Jewish Kabbala, gnosticism, manichaeism and alchemy. The previous chapter pointed to Jung’s deep-seated disillusionment, starting in youth with orthodox Christianity as practised and preached by his father, Pastor Jung. This upheld the doctrine of the all-good, allperfect God alienating both the divine and humankind from its own darker side and hence from a sense of its own completeness. In spite of this, Jung remained a life-long Protestant but became increasingly interested in esoteric religions.</p>
                <p>Jung’s turning to other religions and mysteries represented his quest for the wholeness that incorporating the dark or <em>shadow</em> side of the Godhead could bring about. Alchemy, for instance, could be seen as a subversive force running counter to the arid and sexless Christian doctrine of the middle ages akin to the effect psychoanalysis had on prudish Victorian attitudes to sexuality. Jung was seeking not so much for another faith to substitute for Christianity but for the reality of the psyche that he felt could not be found in its teachings. ‘My Christian faith had been relativized by my encounter with Eastern religions and Greek philosophy’ (Jung, 1977: 213).</p>
                <p>The early part of this chapter will look at some of the formative encounters from philisophy and religion on his ideas, starting with philosophy. He had a lifelong love/hate relationship with the latter claiming always that he was an empiricist who relied for his theorizing on the evidence of inner experience. His ambivalence towards philosophy was part of a general feeling in psychology in the late nineteenth century as it struggled to separate itself from philosophy and become a discipline in its own right. However, as a result of having their roots in philosophy, the early psychologists could not help being philosophers and Jung, in spite of his ambivalence, always acknowledged his debt to philosophy in general and to certain philosophers—described below—in particular.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Philosophy</h3>
                </header>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">jung and Antiquity</em></p>
                <p>In examing Jung’s contributions to theory it is important to explore the roots of his epistemological theory, the study of what we know and how we know it. The first thinker, chronologically speaking, to strike a chord with Jung was the pre-Socratic Heraclitus. He was Jung’s favourite Greek philosopher and is the precursor of many of his seminal theories, such as the concept of opposites and of <em>enantiadromia</em>, a psychological law which denotes ‘running contrariwise’ so that eventually everything turns into its opposite.</p>
                <p>Heraclitus also posited that all things are in a state of flux, which has links to the concept of process. A saying that encapsulates this is that one can never step in the same river twice.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Plato</em></p>
                <p>Plato was impressed by the idea that the whole of the sensory world is ever-changing and unstable and this was to lead to one of his most important philosophical concepts: the theory of forms. Plato attempted to define the essence of reality by stating that every object that exists is an imperfect replica of an ideal form. Further, human concepts such as truth, love, beauty also have their ideal forms. By way of the dialogues, Socrates was attempting to arrive at discovering absolute truth, love and beauty, which were called virtues by Plato. The goal of human existence was the development of virtue.</p>
                <p>Archetypal theory traces its line of descent from the theory of ideal forms. In the same way that the forms themselves are unknowable, so too are archetypes - one can only infer their existence from the manifestation of archetypal images. It is the ideal forms and the <em>archetypes</em> that they engender that emerge into consciousness. ‘In Plato an extraordinarily high value is set on the archetypes as metaphysical ideas, as “paradigms” or models, while real things are held to be only the copies of these model ideas’ (Jung, 1960b: 135).</p>
                <p>The method of discourse that Socrates used in the dialogues was known as the <em>dialectic</em>—one important conception of it being that it progresses by way of ‘successive corrections of an initial onesidedness by means of a series of compensations and modifications aiming at some synthesis that is more comprehensive, larger’ (Jarrett, 1992: 15). The psyche’s propensity for compensation of any one-sided attitude is a central concept of Jung’s as is the dialectic that exists between analyst and analysand in a Jungian analysis.</p>
                <p>For both Plato and Jung the essential human quest lay in solving moral and religious problems.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aristotle</em></p>
                <p>From Aristotle, Plato’s student, Jung derived the all-important category of <em>teleology</em>: the doctrine of final causes. In Aristotle’s philosophy, this was an extension of Plato’s theory of forms which provided the blueprint that guides the object to its final state or <em>telos</em>. The object may never achieve its ideal because of impediments in the way but, according to Aristotle, all life - including that of human beings - has inborn goals. The underlying pattern that is there in Aristotle’s teleology is repeated in Jung’s view of the individuation process.</p>
                <p>In this way it is possible to see Platonic and Aristotelian ideas as formative of Jung’s thinking as they are, of course, of European thought in general.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung and the Enlightenment</em></p>
                <p>The leitmotif of Jung’s life can be seen running through from his early to his late publications. In 1895, at the beginning of his first year at university, he joined a fraternity, Zofingia and over the next few years delivered five lectures which came to be known as the Zofingia lectures. In the first, ‘The Border Zones of Exact Sciences’, delivered in 1896, he upheld the vitalistic view of life which claims that knowing and purpose are present in life itself against a mechanistic view that sets limits to knowledge and a science that reduces reality to matter. The proponents of the latter approach were thinkers like Hermann von Helmholtz, the discoverer of the laws of thermodynamics, and Emil Du Bois-Reymond. The latter distinguished between things that can be known and things which will never be known.</p>
                <p>Jung profoundly disagreed with this mechanistic view and in these early student lectures may be seen the beginnings of his future theory of knowledge. The main emphasis for him lies in <em>experience</em>, which centres on religious experience based on inner reality deeply felt not on rational or dogmatic theory. An earlier religious thinker, Soren Kierkegaard, came to precisely the same conclusion in rejecting Hegel (Casement, 1998). It is through the acknowledgement of personal experience that the individual comes to true selfknowledge and to the transcendent centre of his being, which Jung later called the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Self</em>. Both Kierkegaard and Jung rejected Hegel for being too collective and focused t o o much on the outer world in his thinking. They concentrated instead on ‘inner experience’ as the allimportant guide to living an ethical life.</p>
                <p>In his third Zofingia lecture Jung made the following statement, which gives the underlying basis for his theory of knowledge as personal experience.</p>
                <p>It is the gratification of two <em class="notranslate" translate="no">á priori</em> requirements - the categorical imperative and the category of causality—that, under certain circumstances, makes a person happy and gives him a feeling of contentment which no external factor can confer. The frail and transitory nature of all the external factors in human life is so apparent that there is no need to discuss it . . . The only true basis for philosophy is what we experience of ourselves and, through ourselves, of the world around us. (Nagy, 1991:18) Here we see the profound effect of Kant on Jung’s thinking that it is only through experiencing the inner moral law that humans can achieve happiness. Kant spoke of two things that fill the mind with awe: the starry heaven above and the moral law within. It is to thinkers who offer support for this point of view that Jung turns over and over again throughout his life but the first philosopher to inspire these thoughts in him was Kant. Jung’s reworking of Kant was to result in his assertion that although we cannot <em>know</em> God we can observe the psychic origins of belief in God. Jung substituted ‘inner experience’ for Kant’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">á priori</em> reason but both thinkers were pointing to an innate capacity in humans for knowing.</p>
                <p>A further connection between Jung and Kant’s theory of knowledge was in acknowledging the limitations of human cognitive processes. For Kant, this meant that knowledge was divided into that which one could know through cognition and which he called the phenomenal world, and that which could not, which he termed the noumenal world. This latter he also called the ‘thing-in-itself which came to have great importance for Jung in the development of his theory of archetypes. ‘Things-in-themselves’, according to Kant, are timeless, spaceless, causeless entities within and without the psyche. Jung experienced this theory as one of the great revelations in his life and he remained, in many ways, always a Kantian.</p>
                <p>A critique of Jung’s Kantianism is made by Marilyn Nagy, the Analytical Psychologist, and Heward Wilkinson, the Integrative Psychotherapist. Both Nietzsche and Jung first came to Kant through Schopenhauer but the former later rejected Schopenhauer’s view of Kant whereas Jung did not. As Wilkinson puts it, in his view of Kant, Jung could claim that insight through psychological process makes no <em>objective</em> claim to knowledge. But, according to Kantian logic, nobody else is in any better position to know—yet no one doubts that Newtonian physics is knowledge of <em>something</em> (personal communication with Heward Wilkinson).</p>
                <p>Kant’s epistemology is akin to Descartes in separating the subject and object of knowledge. Hegel takes on this duality but sought a third position that would reconcile the two and overcome the split between them. The Hegelian dialectic states that analysis (taking apart) is inevitably followed by synthesis (coming together). Both Hegel and Jung reached similar conclusions in reconciling the Cartesian dualism by referring to the objectivity of the subjective.</p>
                <p>In this way, the Jungian dialectic has a close affinity to the Hegelian, which is evidenced in the part of this book that deals with the <em>alchemical</em> dialectic. However, as stated above, Jung was reluctant to be associated with Hegel because of his worldliness and idealistic rationality, which Jung thought was dogmatic and lacking in an empirical basis. Further, by affirming that purposefulness in nature points to a purposeful creator, Hegel opened up a new way of theorizing about teleology - his concept of ‘World Soul’ bears a remarkable resemblance to Jung’s ‘Universal Psyche’. Hegel’s ‘Absolute Mind’ was, to all intents and purposes, the mind of God.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">jung and Schopenhauer</em></p>
                <p>The following statement by Jung shows the supreme importance of two philosophers for him: ‘Mentally my greatest adventure had been the study of Kant and Schopenhauer’ (Jung, 1977: 213). In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The World as Will and Idea</em>, Schopenhauer describes the blind will that is at the core of every being - that which Jung would have had him call ‘God’. But Schopenhauer, who was not a theist, was describing his philosophy in the title which may be summarized as noumena and phenomena ä la Kant, or unconscious and consciousness according to Jung. In describing archetypes, Jung insisted that these are not <em>ideas</em> in the sense of representations in the unconscious. Schopenhauer puts it thus:</p>
                <p>But ordinarily it is in the obscure depths of the mind that the rumination of the materials received from without takes place, through which they are worked up into thoughts; and it goes on almost as unconsciously as the conversion of nourishment into the humours and substance of the body. Hence it is that we can often give no account of the origin of our deepest thoughts. They are the birth of our mysterious inner life. Judgements, thoughts, purposes, rise from out that deep unexpectedly and to our own surprise . . . Consciousness is the mere surface of our mind, of which as of the earth, we do not know the inside, but only the crust. (Schopenhauer, 1883: 328)</p>
                <p>There are many other important ideas in Schopenhauer that are to be found in Jung’s work, such as the following: everything that is fundamental in humans works unconsciously like a natural force; the assertion that evil is not just the privation of good but an entity in its own right; the idea that if only one individual were left in the world that one would possess the whole self-being of the world undiminished; that from the age of 36 onwards, energy is not renewable as it is in what Jung calls ‘the first-half of life’ and that the individual lives from then on as if living on his capital. Both men also held to a teleological world view and Jung clearly got his inspiration for an unconscious origin and centre of psychic life from Schopenhauer.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">jung and other Philosophers</em></p>
                <p>As has already been pointed to, the philosophic successors of Kant took up in their different ways the new formulations of teleology opened up by him. Schelling, who labelled it the unconscious Idea, led the Romantic philosophers in pointing to the realization of this through intuition, feeling and imagination.</p>
                <p>Eduard von Hartmann in the late nineteenth century, brought together Schopenhauer’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Will</em> and Schelling’s unconscious <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Idea</em> in a statistical analysis that resulted in a strong case being made for a divine order at work in nature. His major work, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Philosophy of the Unconscious</em>, owed its influence to the fact that it reconciled science and God. What he was trying to achieve in marrying Schopenhauer to Schelling may be seen in the following quote:</p>
                <p>It does not occur to . . . (Schopenhauer) to bring forward the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Idea</em> to explain the adaptation of means to end in Nature, which rather in genuine idealistic fashion he regards as a merely subjective appearance . . . He altogether fails to perceive that the unconscious Will of Nature <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eo ipso</em> pre-supposes an unconscious Idea as goal, content, or object of itself, without which it would be empty, indefinite, and objectless. (Nagy, 1991: 235)</p>
                <p>It is in our own conscious mental activity that we can gain insight into the real nature of causality as follows: an end is willed mentally followed by a conception of how it may be attained by the steps needed to realize it before reaching the desired end. In this way, final causation or teleology, is intrinsic to causality so that science needs only to include ideal (mental) states within its framework. Jung is in a direct line of descent of this kind of nineteenth century attempt to reconcile science and religion.</p>
                <p>Another thinker whose work was dedicated to this reconciliation was Gustav Theodor Fechner, whose main philosophical conviction remained always the unity of the entire universe. For Fechner, the universe is contained in and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">is</em> the living God. His <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Elements of Psychophysics</em> attempted to apply physical laws to the workings of the mind. Freud was enormously influenced by Fechner’s ideas on the pleasure-unpleasure principle; psychic energy; and the economic, dynamic and topographical concepts of the mind. Fechner was a pioneer in establishing psychology as a scientific discipline.</p>
                <p>A philosopher of the early eighteenth century, C.G. Cams, also sought after a greater wholeness in examining the processes at work in nature, the body and the psyche. In the following quote Jung traces the origins of psychoanalysis and analytical psychology back many centuries through the history of ideas:</p>
                <p>Freud is borne along by a particular current of thought which can be traced back to the Reformation. Gradually it freed itself from innumerable veils and disguises, and it is now turning into the kind of psychology which Nietzsche foresaw with prophetic insight - the discovery of the psyche as a new fact. Some day we shall be able to see by what tortuous paths modern psychology has made its way from the dingy laboratories of the alchemists, via mesmerism and magnetism . . . to the philosophical anticipations of Schopenhauer, Cams, and von Hartmann; and how . . . it finally reached Freud through the teachings of the French hypnotists. (Jung, 1961: 325)</p>
                <p>Carus precedes Jung in much of his thinking, for instance, in stating that the highest human fulfilment is the transition from consciousness to the unconscious. This parallels Jung’s idea of becoming unconscious in the right way. Also, Carus’s claim that the unconscious is affected by all humanity, as well as the life of the earth and of the world, could be substituted for Jung’s collective unconscious. He went on to say that the term ‘unconscious’ is applied to what is objectively recognized as nature. It is easy to see why Jung claimed that had Carus lived today he would undoubtedly have been a psychotherapist.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">William James</em></p>
                <p>Although Jung only briefly met the American philosopher and psychologist, William James, on his first visit to the USA in 1909, James was subsequently to have a significant impact on Jung through his writings. Jung was impressed by James’s stress on the importance of taking into account the holistic principle in the study of human personality. Jung was further affected by James in diverging from Freud’s view of libido and broadening it into his own concept of psychic energy. Jung’s theory of psychological types also derives to a considerable degree from James’s ideas on the difference between the ‘tough’- and ‘tender’-minded individual, which in Jung’s re-workings became the <em>‘extraverf’</em> and the <em>‘introvert’</em>. Further, Jung’s development of the <em>collective unconscious</em> owed much to James’s work on subliminal intelligence which he claimed ranged from the bestial and archaic through the visible parts of the psyche and out to the divine and transcendent.</p>
                <p>James’s study of the immediacy of religious experience as psychologically transformative played its part in the development of Jung’s ideas in this area.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">F.W.H. Myers</em></p>
                <p>The English poet, critic, philosopher and psychical researcher was another nineteenth century pioneer in the discovery of the unconscious. Sonu Shamdasani quotes Andre Breton as saying:</p>
                <p>And in spite of the regrettable fact that so many are unacquainted with the work of F.W.H. Myers, which anteceded that of Freud, I think we owe more than is generally conceded to what William James justly called the gothic psychology of F.W.H. Myers. (Shamdasani, 1993: 101)</p>
                <p>The discoverer of automatic writing unleashed as big a storm of disapproval and outrage as did the psychoanalytic ‘discovery’ of the role of sexuality. For Myers ‘the medium of automatic writing becomes a “psychoscope” that reveals the unseen movements of the psyche’ (Shamdasani, 1993: 117). To quote Myers himself: ‘Automatic writing is not a key to all the recesses of our being. But it is a key to something, and it is a key that will actually turn in the lock’ (Shamdasani, 1993: 117).</p>
                <p>Pierre Janet took his notion of the subconscious self from Myers as well as his use of automatic writing as a means of exploring the subconscious and as a therapeutic tool. As was stated above, Flournoy, in comparison to Janet, proposed the existence of nonpathological and creative aspects of the subconscious and emphasized that automatic activity was not in itself inferior to volition. Where Myers differed from previous thinkers on automatism was that he attributed it not to spirits but to subliminal origins and saw it as a form of intrapsychic communication. Jung was impressed with this approach and applied it in much of his writing.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung and Nietzsche</em></p>
                <p>Jung was so profoundly affected by Nietzsche that references to the latter are scattered throughout the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em>. Like Jung, Nietzsche’s father was also a pastor and both might be regarded as essentially psychologized Protestants. Nietzsche’s ideas are the precursors of many of those in psychoanalysis, although Freud claimed not to have read him. Curiously, in the first volume of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em>, Jung quotes a long passage from Nietzsche’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Thus Spake Zarathustra</em>, which is a striking example of cryptomnesia as it closely replicates an entry in a ship’s log that Nietzsche would have had access to when young.</p>
                <p>Later in Volume 1, Jung goes on to claim that Nietzsche was in the grip of an <em>archetype</em> when he wrote <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zarathustra</em>, as it was written at tremendous speed as if a <em>daimon</em> had erupted from his unconscious. In Nietzsche’s case the daimon was Dionysus, the Greek g o d of wine, that he s aw as the source of ‘the will to power’ with which he identified. According to Jung, this led to an inflation so that instead of keeping its revelations to himself Nietzsche felt he had to broadcast its message to the world. As he could not break free of the identification, he eventually suffered the fate of anyone in the grip of an archetype for any length of time, viz. the descent into madness.</p>
                <p>Jung was particularly struck by Nietzsche’s concept of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Obermensch</em> which has been translated a s either the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Superman</em> or the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Overman</em> - both English translations giving a misleadingly gender specific meaning to the term which is not gendered in German. Jung sensed an affinity between this and his theory of the process of <em>individuation</em>. In the years from 1934 - 39, he gave a series of seminars on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zarathustra</em> which have been gathered together in two volumes called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nietzsche’s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1934-1939 by C.G. Jung</em>. This was put together in 1988 by James L. Jarrett.</p>
                <p>The importance of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Übermensch</em> for Nietzsche was in overcoming all his hated dogmas of the nineteenth century: materialism, nationalism, rationality and scientific ‘truths’. As was pointed out above, Jung also took on some of these in the Zofingia Lectures he wrote as a student. The following quote from Nietzsche in a recent book comparing him with Jung illustrates what he meant by the Übermensch:</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">One thing is needful</em>: To ‘give style’ to one’s character - a great and rare art! It is practised by all those who survey the strengths and weaknesses of their nature and then fit them into an artistic plan until everyone of them appears as art and reason and even weaknesses delight the eye. (Hauke, 2000: 173)</p>
                <p>Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch was inspired by Zarathustra, the Persian prophet who had much in common with Christ. He lived between the seventh and ninth centuries B.C. and taught that from time to time a saviour appears bringing a new revelation. Nietzsche’s own experience of this came in his late thirties, the transitional period from the first-half to the second-half of life. Up to that time, he portrayed himself as the Anti-Christ incarnate preaching anti-Christian propaganda. Through his vision of Zarathustra he brought a new message to the world that the former Christian values were no longer enough and that a more ideal morality was needed.</p>
                <p>Nietzsche’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zarathustra</em> was one of the first attempts in modern times at individual initiation and his well-known cry, ‘God is dead’ is the moment when he became gripped by the spirit. As Jung says:</p>
                <p>When you believe there is no such thing as spirit anywhere, you have disinfected the heavens and the whole world and found no God in it . . . as soon as you make such a declaration, the spirit is liberated from its incarnations and then it is in yourself: then your unconscious begins to stir. That happened to Nietzsche. His initiation process began, and he wrote it down as such a man would do. (Jarrett, 1992: 461)</p>
                <p>There are parallels here with Jung’s own concept of <em>individuation</em> which points to a person’s initiation into becoming wholly him or herself distinct from others. This process is set in motion by the stirrings in the unconscious and the activity of the self as distinct from the ego.</p>
                <p>This section on Nietzsche has concentrated on the link between his concept of the Übermensch and Jung’s individuation process but there are many other shared areas in their ideas and lives. Two or three examples will suffice to illustrate this affinity: both shared a prophetic bent and Nietzsche, for instance, predicted the coming of the devastating wars of the twentieth century. Both also pointed to the declining power of Christianity as a world religion and, for Nietzsche, Christianity encouraged a slave morality in preaching the virtue of meekness. The opposite qualities of hardness and selfmastery were personified by the Übermensch.</p>
                <p>Both thinkers have also been accused of supporting the Nazi ideal - Nietzsche with concepts such as <em>amor fati</em>, which means love of destiny, and the <em>blond beast</em>—a term that would apply to the ruthless man of action free to invent his own code of morality. Both these concepts had a profound influence on Jung’s ideas but were criticized by others, such as the German philosopher, Theodor Adorno, who, in the aftermath of Auschwitz, claimed that the impossibility of any affirmation of life had become all too apparent. This view is disputed, so far as Nietzsche is concerned, as follows:</p>
                <p>Jung retained a ‘German-mythological’ stance analagous to Wagner’s, and from which his take on Kant did not protect him. Had he been able to learn from Nietzsche’s original philosophizing and mythological psychologizing, he might have been better immunized against the mythological charisma of the Nazi seduction. (Heward Wilkinson, personal communication)</p>
                <p>Perhaps Jung’s abiding affinity with Nietzsche lay in their capacity for automomatic writing—a gift they both shared for being able to by-pass conscious processes and tap into the unconscious. This is apparent in Nietzsche’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ecce Homo</em> and can be seen in Jung’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation</em>, where he writes in the preface about ‘an automatic play of ideas’ or ‘fantasy thinking’.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Esoteria</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Jung drew his inspiration from a variety of esoteric sources, most of which reached back in time to Gnosticism, kaballah and alchemy. Others were closer in time and included three already mentioned above: William James, Frederick Myers and Theodore Flournoy.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gnosticism</em></p>
                <p>I am indebted to the scholar, Robert Segal, for much of what I am writing on the subject of Gnosticism, both here and in a later chapter with reference to Martin Buber. Segal has generously supplied me with his writings and given permission for my liberal use of them. There are two definitions of Gnosticism. The narrow one sees it as an ancient Christian heresy that arose in the first and second century A.D. before dying out. The broad one defines it as both pre- Christian and non-Christian. Defined most broadly, Gnosticism is modern as well as ancient. Gilles Quispel, the distinguished scholar of Gnosticism, who lectured at the Jung Institute in Zurich, claims that it has its origins in the Jewish tradition.</p>
                <p>In 1945, an Arab peasant discovered in the upper Egyptian desert near Nag Hammadi, a buried treasure consisting of two papyrus texts which showed a deep split in the early Christian Church. The texts showed that some gnostic Christians denied that Christ returned in the flesh and appointed Peter his successor; that many gnostics challenged priestly authority and believed instead in the presence of the divine within the human; and that the way to salvation was through self-knowledge. Quispel, whose admiration for Jung was unbounded, bought the Gnostic codex, Nag Hammadi I, for Jung.</p>
                <p>Gnosticism . . . is the belief in an antithetical dualism of immateriality, which is good, and matter, which is evil. Gnosticism espouses radical dualism in human beings, the cosmos, and divinity; the primordial unity of all immateriality; the yearning to restore that unity; the present entrapment of a portion of immateriality in human bodies; the need for knowledge to reveal to humans that entrapment; and the dependence of humans on a savior to reveal that knowledge to them. (Segal, 1992: 3)</p>
                <p>A great many thinkers apart from Jung have been characterized as Gnostics, including the apostle Paul, Hegel, Blake, Goethe, Byron, Nietzsche, Marx, Hesse, Heidegger, Conrad, Kerouac and Hitler. This is because they all share the ‘Gnostic attitude’ which may be summarized as a dissatisfaction with the world; a belief that it is possible to better it but that improvement must evolve historically; that humans can effect this change and that knowledge ‘gnosis’ is the key to change.</p>
                <p>Jung was in quest of historical prefigurations for his inner experiences and he found these in Gnosticism and alchemy. He displayed an interest in both throughout his writings but considered alchemy more important and devoted three whole volumes to it. This is because he thought that Gnosticism was too distant in time to have a direct bearing on modern psychology and saw alchemy as the medieval nexus between the two.</p>
                <p>The experiences of the alchemists were, in a sense, my experiences, and their world was my world. This was, of course, a momentous discovery: I had stumbled upon the historical counterpart of my psychology of the unconscious. The possibility of a comparison with alchemy, and the uninterrupted intellectual chain back to Gnosticism, gave substance to my psychology. (Jung, 1963b: 231)</p>
                <p>Gnosticism was remote for Jung because of the paucity of texts available before the Nag Hammadi discovery but Segal thinks it may also be related to the fact that, for Jung, Gnosticism was too unworldly. Alchemy, on the other hand, combines the Gnostic focus on immateriality with the modern focus on the transformation of worldly matter. For Jung, the alchemical process of extracting gold from base metals was a continuation of the Gnostic process of liberating fallen sparks from matter. Both appear outward processes but are in fact inner, psychological ones.</p>
                <p>Jung’s historical approach to the psyche points to the significance of Gnosticism for him. He saw humanity as evolving through four stages: primitive, ancient, modern and contemporary. He would have meant this schema to be taken literally to denote chronological stages of humankind’s development. This kind of evolutionary/ historical approach has since been discredited so I have revised his model to apply it to psychological states rather than actual historical stages.</p>
                <p>Briefly, the primitive stage denotes an ego that is not sufficiently distinct from both the outer world and the unconscious. Here there is little sense of individuality and Jung calls people stuck at this stage ‘herd animals’. In identifying themselves with the world, primitives identify themselves with the gods they project onto it. Ancients, for Jung, have a sturdier ego but nevertheless project themselves onto the world in the form of gods whom they worship. Like primitives, ancients experience the world through unconscious projection and are thus not differentiated from either.</p>
                <p>Moderns possess a fully independent ego which has withdrawn projection from the world and in this way demythologized it. They are differentiated from both the outer world and the unconscious but the price they pay for that is that they are alienated from their unconscious and consider themselves to be wholly rational and scientific. The unconscious forces itself upon moderns in the form of neuroses or belief in phenomena from outer space.</p>
                <p>Contemporaries are alive to the existence of non-rational phenomena but aware that traditional means of responding to them are dead. Contemporaries are in a minority and alone have what Jung calls a present-day consciousness. These individuals suffer from the senselessness and aimlessness of their lives and yearn for the kind of fulfilment that religion once provided and for which depthpsychology is now the only path. These are the ones who seek salvation through self-knowledge.</p>
                <p>The link that Jung made between Gnostics and contemporaries was to see the former as erstwhile contemporaries. In this way, Jung portrays his psychology as the contemporary counterpart to Gnostici sm in that Gnostics were seeking a mythology that recognized the reality of evil and the power of the feminine. They were also seeking a religion that came out of experience and not belief. These are all likewise Jungian concepts.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung’s own Gnostic Myth: Seven Sermons to the Dead</em></p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Sermons to the Dead</em> may be seen as Jung’s Gnostic myth which he composed in three evenings in 1916. They sprang out of his confrontation with the collective unconscious during the five years after the break with Freud in 1912. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Sermons</em> are attributed to the second-century Alexandrian Gnostic Basilides but are a formulation of what Jung’s unconscious figure, Philemon might have said.</p>
                <p>The ‘dead’ are the poltergeists that Jung heard breaking into and occupying his house one day and were the souls of dead Christians. These had discovered that mainstream Christianity offered no answers to them after they were dead. One can see here the link to the discontent Jung felt with his father’s inability to answer his questions about religious matters. In the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Sermons</em>, one can see Jung’s unconscious pressing for these answers and in this text he sees himself as a contemporary Basilides.</p>
                <p>To summarize the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sermons</em> briefly, the dead that figure in them have spent their lives in Jerusalem, the birthplace of mainstream Christianity. Basilides, on the other hand, comes from Alexandria, the meeting place of east and west. This represents Jung’s ideal—the meeting of consciousness and the unconscious—so that Basilides epitomizes the individuated self. In typical Gnostic fashion, Jung’s myth is a creation myth and shows ego-consciousness emerging from the pleroma, or godhead, which is the state of primordial unconsciousness. However, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seven Sermons</em> are an inverse of the usual Gnostic quest where the unconscious or godhead seeks to reveal itself to consciousness. In this text, it is unconsciousness that seeks revelation from consciousness.</p>
                <p>Integration is the final goal of his approach and Jung’s espousal of this is the key difference between himself and the Gnostics. Viewed in this way, God and the devil are both manifestations of the Gnostic <em>pleroma</em>, the state of primordial oneness, but instead of cancelling each other out they balance each other. The highest God is for Jung one that is not wholly good but evil as well. Sexuality as well as spirituality are also included in the text which again differentiates the Jungian ideal from the Gnostic. Wholeness not perfection is the aim.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Seven Sermons</em> prefigure what Jung is to become but is not yet and, in the texts, it is Basilides who epitomizes the individuated self. However, Jung rejects the epithet ‘Gnostic’ that has at times been directed at him on the grounds that he is an empirical scientist not a metaphysician. We will return to this theme later in the book when examining Martin Buber’s critique of Jung.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alchemy</em></p>
                <p>Jung had a series of dreams that repeated the same theme that presaged his discovery of alchemy. The dreams showed him that beside his house stood another which was strange to him, although he knew that it had always been there. Finally he had a dream in which he reached the other house or wing and discovered a wonderful library dated from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It contained a number of books full of copper engravings of a strange character and symbols that he had never seen before. Only later did he realize that they were alchemical symbols. About fifteen years later he had created a library of his like the one in the dream.</p>
                <p>The crucial dream he had that anticipated his encounter with alchemy came to him in 1926:</p>
                <p>I was in the South Tyrol. It was wartime. I was on the Italian front and driving back from the front line with a little man, a peasant, in his horsedrawn wagon. All around us shells were exploding, and I knew that we had to push on as quickly as possible, for it was very dangerous.</p>
                <p>We had to cross a bridge and then go through a tunnel whose vaulting had been partially destroyed by the shells. Arriving at the end of the tunnel, we saw before us a sunny landscape, and I recognized it as the region round Verona. Below me lay the city, radiant in full sunlight. I felt relieved, and we drove on out into the green, thriving Lombard plain. The road led through lovely springtime country-side; we saw the rice fields, the olive trees, and the vineyards. Then, diagonally across the road, I caught sight of a large building, a manor house of grand proportions, rather like the palace of a North Italian duke. It was a typical manor house with many annexes and out-buildings. Just as at the Louvre, the road led through a large courtyard and past the palace. The little coach-man and myself drove in through a gate, and from here we could see, through a second gate at the far end, the sunlit landscape again. I looked round: to my right was the <em>iaqade</em> of the manor house, to my left the servants’ quarters and the stables, barns, and other out-buildings, which stretched on for a long way. Just as we reached the middle of the courtyard, in front of the main entrance, something unexpected happened: with a dull clang, both gates flew shut. The peasant leaped down from his seat and exclaimed, ‘Now we are caught in the seventeenth century.’ Resignedly I thought, ‘Well, that’s that! But what is there to do about it? Now we shall be caught for years.’ Then the consoling thought came to me: ‘Someday, years from now, I shall get out again.’ (Jung, 1963b: 228)</p>
                <p>After this dream he ploughed through volumes of religion and philosophy but nothing helped throw light on the message of the dream. Light finally dawned in 1928 when the sinologist, Richard Wilhelm, sent Jung the text of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Secret of the Golden Flower</em>, an exposition on Chinese alchemy.</p>
                <p>The problem of opposites called up by the shadow plays a great—indeed, the decisive - role in alchemy, since it leads in the ultimate phase of the work to the union of opposites in the archetypal form of the <em>hierosgamos</em> or ‘chymical wedding’. Here the supreme opposites, male and female (as in the Chinese <em class="notranslate" translate="no">yang</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">yin</em>), are melted into a unity purified of all opposition and therefore incorruptible. (Jung, 1953: 37)</p>
                <p>What appealed to him in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Secret of the Golden Flower</em> as he writes in his commentary on it was the parallel he discovered in the text to the psychic development of his patients. For him, the alchemical goal of extracting gold from base metals is mirrored in analytical work in the gradual extraction of the unconscious gold from the base metal of consciousness to lead to the higher union of the two. He says that the Western psyche, unlike that of the Chinese, has been uprooted from its origins in the unconscious and become one-sided. The commentary contains some of Jung’s most wise quotations, as for instance when he says that the fundamental problems of life cannot be solved but simply outgrown. This is inherently so as they express the necessary polarity that exists in any self-regulating system such as the psyche is. It is remaining stuck in a problem that is pathological.</p>
                <p>In another place he says that the one-sided consciousness of the Western psyche has led many Westerners to believe that they have outgrown gods and demons, but as he warns:</p>
                <p>What we have left behind are . . . not the psychic facts that were responsible for the birth of the gods. We are still as much possessed by autonomous psychic contents as if they were Olympians. Today they are called phobias, obsessions, and so forth; in a word neurotic symptoms. The gods have become diseases. (Jung, 1967: 37)</p>
                <p>As a result of reading this text, Jung began to seek out alchemical books and found one written in 1593 called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Artis Auriferae Volumina Duo</em>. At first he would only look at the pictures and was so resistant to it that he left it almost untouched for two years. When he did start to read the text he still felt it was nonsense but occasionally came across a few sentences that meant something to him. Eventually he realized that the alchemists were writing in symbols that were akin to his own work on mythology and archetypes. After that he began to steep himself in alchemical texts and studied them over the next ten years.</p>
                <p>What particularly excited Jung was the affinity he felt between his ideas and those in alchemy to do with archetypal transformation. In this way, he found the link to what Goethe was caught in his life’s work on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em>, which Jung describes as ‘a living substance, a suprapersonal process’ (Jung, 1963b: 232).</p>
                <p>Alchemy also linked him to the work of Paracelsus which finally led to him discussing it in relation to religion and psychology. As a result of this he was able to write <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology and Alchemy</em>, where he describes the alchemical process of transformation that underlay his own experiences from 1913 - 18. As has been said above, Jung remained a life-long Protestant and his attempt to link alchemy to Christianity ultimately led him to examine the figure of Christ as a psychological figure. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology and Alchemy</em>, he draws a parallel between Christ and the <em>lapis</em>, or stone, which is the central concept of the alchemists.</p>
                <p>Jung returned to the problem of Christ in his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aion</em>, where he explores the development over the centuries of the religious content which Christ represented in the collective psyche. At that time, the power of Rome as embodied in the divine Caesar had crushed the spiritual life of countless numbers of people. Jung says that it was the Jewish concept of the Messiah that became constellated as a world issue and the Son of God, embodied in Christ, was opposed to the might of Caesar. In the technological age we live in this hope of redemption has become projected on UFOs and aliens from outer space.</p>
                <p>Along with the religious correspondence to alchemy, Jung also explored the psychological in the form of the <em>transference</em>. This will be gone into at greater length later in this chapter with a fuller exposition of Jung’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Psychology of the Transference</em>. As a preparation for that, it is important to look at how Jung came to study the concept of the <em>coniunctio</em> in alchemy. The alchemist would often use elements in his work that were oppositional because the attraction of opposites led to their eventual convergence out of which arose a new element. As so often with Jung , the move to studying this was also heralded in a dream accompanied by images of the Christ figure. As this is a long dream a summary will be given rather than a description in Jung’s own words.</p>
                <p>He dreamed once more that he was in a house with a wing he had never visited. He entered and came to a big double door which led to a room set up as a laboratory. It was his father’s workroom and was full of glass bottles containing every imaginable sort of fish. As he looked round the room he noticed a curtain billowing out as if blown by a strong wind. A young man from the country materialized and Jung asked him to look and see whether a window was open. When he returned, Jung saw an expression of terror on his face. The young man said that it was haunted.</p>
                <p>Jung then went out and found himself in his mother’s room. There was no one in it but the atmosphere was uncanny. There were numbers of beds in pairs suspended from the ceiling and he knew that this was where his mother slept and that the beds were for spirits who came in pairs.</p>
                <p>Opposite this r o om was a lobby with a brass band playing loudly. It was empty but the band went on blaring out dance and marching music. This was his worldly jovial fa9ade with the mysterious rooms behind it which no one would have guessed at.</p>
                <p>He interpreted the dream in this way and s aw the most important images in the dream as the room for spirits and the fish laboratory. The former pointed for Jung to the coniunctio, and the latter to the symbol for Christ which is the fish. Jung saw this dream as signalling the fact that the ‘cure of souls’ rested with his parents which meant that it was still latent in Jung’s own unconscious.</p>
                <p>The dream also reminded Jung of the Grail legend and the suffering of the ‘fisher king’ Amfortas from the wound that would not heal. Jung says that this is the Christian suffering which he witnessed in his father and for which the alchemists sought the ‘panacea’. The theriomorphic attributes of the gods denote that they dwell not only in the superhuman regions but also in the subhuman realms: ‘as above so below’ is an alchemical saying often quoted by Jung. It is this subversive, earthy imagery of alchemy, often expressed in animal form, that was compensatory to the sexlessness of medieval Christianity. As Jung says in the following quote: ¢ person whose roots are above as well as below is thus like a tree growing simultaneously downwards and upwards. The goal is neither height nor depth, but the centre’ (Jung, 1967: 264).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kabbala</em></p>
                <p>Allusions to the Kabbala, the Jewish mystical tradition, are scattered throughout the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Collected Works</em>, particularly in relation to the feminine principle or the male/female dichotomy. For Jung , as for the Kabbalists, the feminine ‘is as often as not conventionally associated with darkness, negativity, even what we call evil’ (Gottlieb, 1994: 63). She goes on to say that what Jung seems to have taken from the Kabbala is the concept that there is something disturbing about the feminine in a logical universe but that without the feminine there would be no life at all. This paradox led to the view of the feminine as a necessary evil.</p>
                <p>In the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bahir</em>, the first manuscript of the Jewish mystical tradition, the feminine tree is added after the nine masculine trees so that God’s garden would endure. Jung transposes this notion on to the concept of the Trinity in Christianity. Originally the Trinity was all spiritual and therefore all masculine but room had to be found for the feminine. The fourth? the feminine? was added and with it the possibility of evil. Jung equated this feminine with the Shulamit of the Song of Songs who is ‘black but beautiful’ and ‘comes from the same category as the black goddesses (Isis, Artemis, Parvati, Mary) whose names mean “earth”‘ (Jung, 1963a: 420).</p>
                <p>Jung also resorts to the Kabbala when writing about the fragmentation and reintegration of the psyche. His ‘description of the many sparks of a primal World Soul or collective unconscious is based on Kabbalistic and Hassidic notions of the “breaking of the vessels’” (Gottlieb, 1994: 67). It is in the unconscious that these sparks or scintillae are hidden and are like seeds of consciousness buried in the darkness.</p>
                <p>A Kabbalist idea of the collaboration between Man and God was to have a huge impact on Jung and culminated in the writing of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em>. This is found in the writings of Isaac Luria, a sixteenth-century Kabbalist, who says that in the act of creation, God formed vessels to contain the light but as they were too weak they broke. In this way, evil entered the world and since then everything was touched by the consequences of the split. It was Man who was called upon because of his consciousness to help God to overcome the split.</p>
                <p>The Jew has the advantage of having long since anticipated the development of consciousness in his own spiritual history. By this I mean the Lurianic stage of the Kabbalah, the breaking of the vessels and man’s help in restoring them. Here the thought emerges for the first time that man must help God to repair the damage wrought by the Creation. For the first time man’s cosmic responsibility is acknowledged. (Jaffe, 1989: 102).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Father Victor White</em></p>
                <p>Victor White was an English Dominican priest and a reader in Theology at Blackfriars, Oxford. He was a founding member of the Jung Institute in Zurich and lectured widely on Jungian psychology seeking to reconcile it with religion. As a result of this relationship, Jung felt that he had at last encountered a member of the clergy who understood what he was trying to say. He bemoaned the fact that other theologians s aw him as an atheistic metaphysician rather than as an agnostic psychologist. Only White ‘has successfully undertaken to feel his way into the empiricist’s manner of thinking as far as possible’ (White, 1961: 307).</p>
                <p>The issue that finally came between them was that of the doctrine of <em>privatio boni</em> or the Christian view of evil as the privation of good. For Jung, on the contrary, evil was a force in its own right and he insisted that Christianity had to include the devil in its concept of God. White parted company with him on this issue as he felt that in so doing, Jung was breaking his own self-imposed boundary of remaining within psychology and was now trespassing into the realm of theology. By doing so and by saying what he had about evil, what Jung was advocating was tantamount to heresy according to White.</p>
                <p>That is how the Christian doctrine gets out of its inherent dualism, i.e., Manicheism, by denying the existence of Evil. You do deny it by calling Evil a decreasing Good. Absolute Evil is for you a merely neutral condition, in which there is nothing at all. (Adler, 1976: 73) The main thrust of Jung’s argument with Christianity is that it embodies a one-sided version of God and, by doing so, robs it of its essential diversity. Paradoxically, Jung also points to the <em>One</em> and it is this paradox that encapsulates the quintessence of Jung’s religious viewpoint.</p>
                <p>White felt let down when <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em> appeared as he had no idea that Jung actually intended publishing it. (Personal communication by Murray Stein, 1999). However, they never broke with each other completely and continued to correspond until White’s death from cancer in 1960.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em></p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em>, was a highly personal and emotional outpouring by Jung in which he tried to formulate ideas that had perplexed him throughout his life about the fundamental nature of evil and the ‘tragic contradictoriness’ of God.</p>
                <p>The origins of the book lie in Jung’s earlier one <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aion</em> where he had dealt with the psychology of Christianity. T o quote Jung about why he felt impelled to write <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Answer to Job</em>: ‘The most immediate cause of my writing the book is perhaps to be found in certain problems discussed in my book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aion</em>, especially the problems of Christ as a symbolic figure and of the antagonism Christ-Antichrist, represented in the traditional zodiacal symbolism of the two fishes’ (Jung, 1958: ix).</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aion</em> there are references to the bright and dark side of divinity and this ambivalent God-image plays a crucial part in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Book of Job</em>. For Jung, Job is a prefiguration of Christ - the link between them being the idea of suffering. As Jung says: ‘In the final analysis it is God who created the world and its sins, and who therefore became Christ in order to suffer the fate of humanity’ (Jung, 1963b: 243).</p>
                <p>The problem of Job had manifested itself in a dream as so often happened at momentous times for Jung. This is another long dream in which he is accompanied by his father throughout and the following is the last part of it:</p>
                <p>We then entered the house, and I saw that it had very thick walls. We climbed a narrow staircase to the second floor. There a strange sight presented itself: a large hall which was the exact replica of the <em>divan-ikaas</em> (council hall) of Sultan Akbar at Fatehpur Sikri. It was a high circular room with a gallery running along the wall, from which four bridges led to a basin-shaped centre. The basin rested upon a huge column and formed the sultan’s round seat. From this elevated place he spoke to his councillors and philosophers, who sat along the walls in the gallery. The whole was a gigantic mandala. It corresponded precisely to the real <em>divan-i-kaas</em>.</p>
                <p>In the dream I suddenly saw that from the centre a steep flight of stairs ascended to a spot high up on the wall - which no longer corresponded to reality. At the top of the stairs was a small door, and my father said, ‘Now I will lead you into the highest presence.’ Then he knelt down and touched his forehead to the floor. I imitated him, likewise kneeling, with great emotion. For some reason I could not bring my forehead quite down to the floor—there was perhaps a millimetre to spare. But at least I had made the gesture with him. Suddenly I knew—perhaps my father had told me—that that upper door led to a solitary chamber where lived Uriah, King David’s general, whom David had shamefully betrayed for the sake of his wife Bathsheba, by commanding his soldiers to abandon Uriah in the face of the enemy. (Jung, 1963b: 246)</p>
                <p>The Indian setting of the dream harks back to when Jung actually visited the sub-continent and was impressed by the mandala structure of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">divan-i-kaas</em> at the centre of which was the seat of Akbar the Great, who, like King David, is a worldly lord. But in the dream Uriah is placed highest as the guiltless victim who was abandoned by David. Jung sees Uriah as a pre-figuration of Christ who was abandoned by God. Furthermore, David had possessed himself of Uriah’s wife. Jung only understood later the two reasons why Uriah featured in this dream when he felt himself impelled to speak out publicly about the ambivalence of the Old Testament God and Emma Jung was taken from him by death.</p>
                <p>The lack of complete submission on his part in the dream signified for Jung that something in him was defiant just as it was in other free human beings as, for instance, those who wrote the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Book of Job</em>.</p>
                <p>The main thrust of what Jung ends up saying about the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Book of Job</em> is that Job proves morally superior to God by withstanding all the trials that are heaped on him without losing faith. This so impresses divinity that the latter incarnates as Christ.== Besides his love of mankind a certain irascibility is noticeable in Christ’s character, and, as is often the case with people of emotional temperament, a manifest lack of self-reflection. There is no evidence that Christ ever wondered about himself, or that he ever confronted himself. To this rule there is only one significant exception - the despairing cry from the Cross: ‘My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?’ Here his human nature attains divinity; at that moment God experiences what it means to be a mortal man and drinks to the dregs what he made his faithful servant Job suffer. Here is given the answer to Job, and, clearly, this supreme moment is as divine as it is human, as ‘eschatological’ as it is ‘psychological’. (Jung, 1958: 46)</p>
                <p>He ends the book by saying: ‘Strictly speaking, the God-image does not coincide with the unconscious as such, but with a special content of it, namely the archetype of the self. It is the archetype from which we can no longer distinguish the God-image empirically’ (Jung, 1958: 107).</p>

                </header>
                <p>Reference will be made in the following pages to lengthy passages from two of Jung’s works in order to give a fuller picture of how he elaborated ideas that he developed from the formative encounters he had with the thinkers discussed earlier in this chapter. His own theoretical formulations evolved over many years and he would add to or take out from published works as he went along. In this way, when revising any of his writings, he would do a cut-and-paste job and incorporate large amounts of new thinking in previously published texts.</p>
                <p>The two works that will be referred to below have been selected because they provide g o o d illustrations of his major theories. The first one is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious: A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido</em>, which he was writing while still working closely with Freud. The second is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</em>, which was partly inspired by Jung’s attempt to make sense of the subsequent break.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious: A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido</em></p>
                <p>This book was first published under the above title in 1912 and republished 37 years later under the title <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia</em>. At the latter time, Jung revised it considerably, stating that it had been in urgent need of revision as when he wrote it he was under considerable pressure of work so that it consisted of ‘larger or smaller fragments which I could only string together in an unsatisfying manner’ (Jung, 1956: xxiii). His aim in writing it in the first place was as follows:</p>
                <p>One of my principal aims was to free medical psychology from the subjective and personalistic bias that characterized its outlook at that time, and to make it possible to understand the unconscious as an objective and collective psyche. The personalism in the views of Freud and Adler that went hand in hand with the individualism of the nineteenth century failed to satisfy me because, except in the case of instinctive dynamisms (which actually have too little place in Adler), it left no room for objective, impersonal facts. Freud, accordingly, could see no objective justification for my attempt, but suspected personal motives. (Jung, 1956: xxiv)</p>
                <p>Looking back from the perspective of 3 7 years, Jung declared in the Foreword to the new edition that the need to write the book in the first place arose out of his growing interest in mythology and in discovering his own myth. The book laid down the programme he was to follow for the next few decades of his life which was his growing concern with the mythological and symbolical realm that underlay consciousness. As he expresses it:</p>
                <p>Individual consciousness is only the flower and the fruit of a season, sprung from the perennial rhizome beneath the earth; and it would find itself in better accord with the truth if it took the existence of the rhizome into its calculations. For the root matter is the mother of all things. (Jung, 1956: xxiv)</p>
                <p>The book was written in his 36th year, which marks for Jung the second half of life when a mental transformation often takes place in individuals. It was to mark the beginning of his life’s work where the real patient in the book is Jung himself embarking on his own individuation process. As mentioned above, this entailed a fiveyear- long confrontation with the unconscious and I have written elsewhere of the nexus between major rites of passage and the constellation of archetypal shadow.</p>
                <p>The references to this work will concentrate on the original 1912 version reissued in 1991 with an introduction by William McGuire, in which he points out the huge amount of extraverted activity that Jung was caught up in between the years 1909 - 11. His personal life at this time was demanding - he had a wife and four children and was building a home at Küsnacht to house them all. He gave up his position at the Burghölzli and launched his private practice; w a s the President of the International Psychoanalytic Association and Editor of the Yearbook; wrote eight articles and two dozen notices;</p>
                <p>travelled to the USA and to various parts of Europe; fulfilled his Swiss military service for one month of each year; was involved in training younger analysts, including J. J. Honegger and Sabina Spielrein. Both contributed to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious</em>, which he was writing at the same time as his involvement in the above activities.</p>
                <p>As McGuire goes on to say, the progress of the book is reflected in the correspondence with Freud and the first letter containing hints of his growing interest in mythology and symbolism is in October 1909, immediately after the trip to America with Freud and Ferenzi. Mention of the book occurs from then on in the correspondence between the two and Freud responds positively to the growing references to mythology on Jung’s part.</p>
                <p>Around 1910 Frank Miller is first mentioned in the Freud/Jung correspondence edited by McGuire in 1974. It is her automatic writing at the request of her psychiatrist Theodore Flournoy that is to set Jung off on his creative writing that has its end result in the book. Jung is now warning Freud in a letter dated 13 December, to be prepared to read something from him ‘the like of which you have never heard from me’. However, he continues to keep the manuscript from Freud who writes on 22 January 1911: ‘I don’t know why you are so afraid of my criticism in matters of mythology.’ In fact, Freud is himself working on a mythological piece that eventually became <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Totem and Taboo</em>.</p>
                <p>In March 1911 came the suicide of Honegger, which was mourned by both Jung and Freud. The former’s work was of enormous importance in Jung’s discovery of the collective unconscious, with the following piece of work he had done with a patient:</p>
                <p>Honegger discovered the following hallucination in an insane man (paranoid dement): The patient sees in the sun an ‘upright tail’ similar to an erected penis. When he moves his head back and forth, then, too, the sun’s penis sways back and forth in a like manner, and out of that the wind arises. This strange hallucination remained unintelligible to us for a long time until I became acquainted with the Mithraic liturgy and its visions. (Jung, 1991: 96)</p>
                <p>The Mithraic liturgy cited by Jung coincided closely with the vision of the patient and the importance of this coincidence can be seen from the following written statement by Freud:</p>
                <p>For everyone involved in the development of psychoanalysis when C.G. Jung, at a private scientific gathering, reported through one of his students that the fantasies of certain mental patients (dementia praecox) coincided strikingly with the mythological cosmogonies of ancient peoples of whom these uneducated patients could not possibly have had any scholarly knowledge. (Jung, 1991: xxiii)</p>
                <p>Shortly before the Third Psychoanalytical Congress in Weimar, Freud spent four days with Jung and his wife in September 1911 at Küsnacht. This appears to have been a tense visit as a few weeks after this Emma Jung wrote to Freud: ‘Since your visit I have been tormented by the idea that your relation with my husband is not altogether as it should be . . .’ (Jung, 1991: xxi). She goes on to say that she suspects that Freud is not agreeable to the book as he did not speak of it at all even though Jung was awaiting his verdict with great trepidation.</p>
                <p>Although there was no visible sign of tension at the Weimar Congress, and the tenor of their correspondence appears amiable on the surface, yet McGuire writes:</p>
                <p>What could be called a collision course now becomes evident in the exchange. Both men swing between extremes of affect. There are fewer instances of the wit and grace, the friendliness, that had often brightened the letters. Freud appears patient, yet clearly uneasy over Jung’s direction.</p>
                <p>(Jung, 1991: xxiii)</p>
                <p>Following this came the unfortunate ‘Kreuzungen gesture’ when Freud travelled to Kreuzungen, situated on the Swiss side of Lake Constance, to visit the sick Ludwig Binswanger. He did not go on to visit Jung who, not knowing of Binswanger’s illness, took it as a personal insult. A full account of the Freud/Jung rupture is given elsewhere in this book.</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious</em> was translated into English by Beatrice Hinkle, an American physician who became the city physician of San Francisco, the first American woman to hold such a post. It was her work with victims of the bubonic plague and their varying reactions to it that led to her taking up the practice of psychotherapy. She moved to the east coast and established the first psychotherapy clinic in the USA at the medical school of Cornell University. She came to Europe to have analysis with Freud or one of his disciples but was immediately drawn to Jung’s approach and after the break between him and Freud, she chose to remain in the Jungian camp.</p>
                <p>When the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious</em> was first published in English in 1916 by an American publisher Hinkle wrote an introduction to it that included the following:</p>
                <p>It is this great theme (the self-sacrifice motive) which Jung sees as the real motive lying hidden in the myths and religions of man from the beginning, as well as in the literature and artistic creations of both ancient and modern time, and which he works out with the greatest wealth of detail and painstaking effort in the book herewith presented. (Jung, 1991: xxix)</p>
                <p>Hinkle also persuaded Jung to let her divide the long Chapter VI, ‘The Battle of Deliverance from the Mother’, into a second chapter entitled, ‘The Dual Mother’, Chapter VII. In 1925, Jung brought out an unrevised second edition of the book in which he stated that the late Theodore Flournoy had told him that he—Jung—’had hit off her mentality very well. Valuable confirmation of this reached me in 1918, through an American colleague who was treating Frank Miller for the schizophrenic disturbance which had broken out after her sojourn in Europe’ (Jung, 1991: xxx) .</p>
                <p>Sonu Shamdasani’s (1990) paper, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Woman Called Frank</em>, describes Frank Miller as ‘ Jung ‘ s Imago’ - ‘imago’ being the term used at the time of writing the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious</em> before he changed it to ‘archetype’. In 1912, Jung was predisposed to diagnose her as a case of schizophrenia as a result of his linking mythology to that disorder as we have seen above. When he later revised the text, the emphasis had changed for him to the attitude of consciousness to mythological phenomena and he pathologizes Frank Miller as having ‘not the faintest idea of what is happening. . . ‘ (Jung, 1956: 397).</p>
                <p>It is hardly to be supposed that Miss Miller, who evidently had not the faintest clue as to the real meaning of her visions - which even Theodore Flournoy, despite his fine feeling for values, could do nothing to explain - would be able to meet the next phase of the process, namely the assimilation of the hero to her conscious personality, with the right attitude . . . The instinctual impulse that was trying to rouse the dreamer from the sleep of childhood was opposed by a personal pride that was distinctly out of place, and also, one must suppose by a correspondingly narrow moral horizon. (Jung, 1956: 441)</p>
                <p>We see Jung here applying his theory of teleology rather too astringently and giving the patient a good telling off for failing to come up to scratch. Even the previously much-admired Flournoy comes in for a bit of a dressing down. It is salutory to read the earlier and later editions side-by-side as an example of the radical revisions that Jung would make to previous texts.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Libido</em> Throughout the three chapters on libido in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious</em>, one can see Jung working out his own theory of libido and using his method of amplification to elaborate it. As is apparent by now from what has already been said above, Jung never wholeheartedly accepted Freud’s version and in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of the Unconscious</em> he is now embarking on his own concept of psychic energy. Jung acknowledges that Freud had also come to realize the need to widen the concept of libido after his famous examination of the Schreber case, where the longed for reality may be traced back not only to the withdrawal of the libidinous impulses.</p>
                <p>In exploring his own theorizing in this direction, Jung returns both to his work with schizophrenic patients and to Janet’s <em>‘fonction du ree’</em> or the reality function. With regard to the former, Jung says that he was unable to establish the theory of this psychosis based on the concept of the displacement of libido. The whole of the function of reality is lacking to such a degree that movement of any kind is lost to the patient, as in catatonic schizophrenia.</p>
                <p>He could, however, see the validity of Freud’s libido theory when applied to the transference neuroses where the erotic libido has been repressed followed by regression into an earlier path of transference, for instance, that of the parental transference. Yet here again, Jung claims that it is only that portion of the libido which is tied up in the neurosis which is lacking to the patient. The rest of the libido related to adaptation to reality is still available.</p>
                <p>Following on from this, Jung then takes issue with Abraham’s theory that the withdrawal of sexual libido from the outer world results in paranoid or schizophrenic symptomatology. Again the transference of sexual libido to schizophrenia is impossible because this illness produces a loss of reality that cannot be put at the door of deficiency of libido defined in the narrow sense.</p>
                <p>Jung then puts forward the hypothesis that in the history of evolution there was a gradual diminution in the animal kingdom of the general impulse to propagate. This has led to the displacement of the procreative instinct onto mechanisms of allurement limited to the breeding season and to protection of the young. Even if there can be no doubt that everything has its origins in sexual libido ‘it would be a poor, unaesthetic generalization if one were to include music in the category of sexuality. A similar nomenclature would then lead us to classify the cathedral of Cologne as mineralogy because it is built of stones’ (Jung, 1991: 130).</p>
                <p>The transformation of primal libido into non-sexualized functions is still taking place and where the individual succeeds in adapting to it it is called ‘sublimation’. Where it is pathological it is termed ‘repression’. So, for Jung, when an individual takes his libido away from investment in the outer world, the energy is taken away from those desexualized instincts which properly support the function of reality.</p>
                <p>Jung here returns to the confrontation with Abraham’s theory of sexualized libido in hysteria and schizophrenia. Jung agrees that hysterical introversion of the sexualized libido leads to autoerotism because the person’s erotic influx of libido, which is designed for reality functioning, becomes transferred to the ego.</p>
                <p>The schizophrenic shuns reality to a much greater degree than the influx of sexualized libido would account for so that his inner condition is radically different from the hysteric’s. The inner condition here is more than autoerotic and there is, instead, an intra-psychic equivalent of reality which is invested with dynamics other than sexualized libido. For this reason, Jung agrees with Bleuler’s rejection of the concept of autoerotism taken by Abraham from the study of hysteria and applied to schizophrenia. When dealing with the latter, Bleuler proposed replacing autoerotism with autism.</p>
                <p>Having offered his revised genetic theory of libido in relation to schizophrenia, Jung goes on to explore whether this revised theory would also apply to the neuroses. He decides that it does because temporary functional disturbances appear in the neuroses which go beyond the boundaries of the sexual, for instance, in psychotic episodes.</p>
                <p>Jung then begins a fascinating exploration of the ‘as if which arises out of his proposition that the replacement of the disturbed function of reality is affected by an archaic or mythological surrogate. He quotes Spielrein in support of this as follows: ‘I often had the illusion that these patients might be simply victims of a folk superstition’ (Jung, 1991: 137). The vision of the alchemist, Zosimos, often cited by Jung, showed that superstitions were once symbols and it is these that provide the bridges for partial amounts of libido to pass over into the mental realm. For instance, where the union of two transference symbols to replace the generative organs may be used culturally to explain the origin of humankind. As Jung says: ‘The propelling motive of this transition of the <em>immediate sexual</em> libido to the non-sexual representation can, in my opinion, be found only in a <em>resistance which opposes primitive sexuality*</em> (Jung, 1991: 138).</p>
                <p>This fantasy analogy formation would lead to increasing amounts of libido becoming desexualized as new objects became assimilated as sexual symbols. Jung even conjectures that human consciousness may have been arrived at entirely in this way. As we saw above, Jung is using Miller’s writing as the raw material from which there might come a possible transformation of the libido into the heroic quest for consciousness. It is also the source of human discoveries which he then sets out to demonstrate by amplifying case material from one of his patients.</p>
                <p>The patient was suffering from a depressive catatonic condition that Jung was treating analytically, in the course of which, she fell into a hysterical, dream-like state displaying evidence of sexual excitement. She started to masturbate and, at the same time, made a <em>‘violent rotary motion’</em> (Jung’s italics) with the forefinger of the left hand on her left temple, as if she were boring a hole there.</p>
                <p>Boring into bodily orifices, nail-biting, finger-sucking, and picking at parts of the body are linked to infantile sexual activity which may often persist into adulthood. Jung consulted with the patient’s mother who confirmed that as a child, the patient would rhythmically beat her head against the door. Later, she began to bore a hole with her finger in the wall plaster keeping herself occupied with this activity for hours at a time. From the age of four she began to masturbate.</p>
                <p>In order to bring the major themes—libido, sun/fire, boring - that he has been exploring in these chapters into some sort of relationship with each other, Jung now embarks on a process of amplification which links mythical thinking across different cultures. This will be elaborated further in the next chapter.</p>
                <p>Abraham’s book on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dreams and Myths</em>, took up some of the discoveries of Adalbert Kuhn in his work <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mythologische Studien</em>. Kuhn links the Greek Prometheus, who was the fire-bringer, with the Hindu Pramantha, the masculine fire-rubbing piece of wood. The path from Pramantha to Prometheus passes not through the word, but through the idea, and, therefore, we should adopt this same meaning for Prometheus as that which Pramantha attains from the Hindu fire symbolism’ (Jung, 1991: 144).</p>
                <p>In this way, Jung came to broaden the psychoanalytic concept of libido with his own metaphor of psychic energy. Basically, Jung’s approach to psychic energy is concerned with meaning and with the symbols of transformation that accompany changes in the direction of the flow of energy.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Plato and Aristotle! These are not merely two systems, they are types of two distinct human natures, which from time immemorial, under every sort of disguise, stand more or less inimically opposed . . . Although under other names, it is always of Plato and Aristotle that we speak. Visionary, mystical, Platonic natures disclose Christian ideas and the corresponding symbols from the fathomless depths of their souls. Practical, orderly, Aristotelian natures build out of these ideas and symbols a fixed system, a dogma and a cult. Finally the Church embraces both natures, one of them entrenched in the clergy and the other in monasticism, but both keeping up a constant feud. (Jung, 1971: 2)</p>
                <p>The above quote from Heine is at the front of the book Jung wrote during his fallow period from 1913 - 17 in which he was trying to differentiate himself from Freud and Adler and to understand the rift that had recently taken place between the three of them. As an empiricist—something that Jung emphasized about himself over and over again—he also had a broader interest in trying to understand the conflicts and misunderstandings that arise in human interactions in every situation.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</em> is an early work in which we see Jung’s ideas taking shape, for instance, his incipient thinking on archetypes. His Kantian bias is evident in the book as he takes up the discussion that he comes back to many times in his writings. This is centred on whether or not the mind is originally <em>tabula rasa</em>, that is a blank slate in which ideas are only epiphenomenal abstractions from outer experience. Kant demonstrated that certain categories of thinking are <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a priori</em>, that is innate and prior to all experience. Jung takes these Kantian ideas and applies them to his own thinking about the brain as the depository of patterns of phylogenetic experiences and attempts at adaptation.</p>
                <p>These patterns of experience are by no means accidental or arbitrary; they follow strictly preformed conditions which are not transmitted by experience as contents of apprehension but are the preconditions of all apprehension . . . We may think of them, as Plato did, as <em>images</em>, as schemata, or as inherited functional possibilities. (Jung, 1971: 304) Jung proposes two mechanisms - introversion and extraversion—both of which are at work in all humans. It is only the relative predominance of the one over the other that determines whether an individual is more extraverted or introverted. The extraverted attitude depicts a movement of interest outwards to the object; the introverted attitude, on the other hand, results in a movement of interest inwards to the subject.</p>
                <p>Having identified two groups of psychological individuals, Jung then goes on to say that within each there are huge differences between individuals making up the group. Jung came to see empirically that there were also psychological functions that differentiate individuals from one another and identified these as <em>thinking, feeling, sensation</em> and <em>intuition</em>. Furthermore, each of these functions is either predominantly <em>extraverted</em> or <em>introverted</em>. In this way, Jung ends up identifying eight possible types that go to make up his scheme of psychological types.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">William James</em></p>
                <p>William James was, in part, the inspiration for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychological Types</em>, with his division of temperament into two kinds which he identified as the ‘rationalist’ and the ‘empiricist’. The former is ‘your devotee of abstract and eternal principles’; the latter the ‘lover of facts in all their crude variety’ (Jung, 1971: 300). James goes on to make ‘rationalism’ equate with ‘intellectualism’ and ‘empiricism’ with ‘sensationalism’. James summarizes both types with his well-known dichotomy of ‘tender-minded’ for the ‘rationalist’ and ‘toughminded’ for the ‘empiricist’.</p>
                <p>They have a low opinion of each other. Their antagonism, whenever as individuals their temperaments have been intense, has formed in all pages a part of the philosophic atmosphere of the time. It forms a part of the atmosphere today. The tough think of the tender as sentimentalists and soft-heads. The tender feel the tough to be unrefined, callous, or brutal . . . Each type believes the other to be inferior to itself. (Jung, 1971: 301)</p>
                <p>The qualities that James associates with the ‘tender-minded’ type are: rationalistic; intellectualistic; idealistic; optimistic; religious; free-willist; monistic; dogmatical. Those he associates with the ‘tough-minded’ are: empiricist; sensationalistic; materialistic; pessimistic; irreligious; fatalistic; pluralistic; sceptical. The ‘rationalistic’ is broken down further into ‘going by principles’ and the ‘empiricist’ into ‘going by facts’. The ‘sensationalistic’ in James’s model denotes extreme empiricism where sensory experience is the exclusive source of knowing.</p>
                <p>Jung acknowledged James’s contribution in drawing attention to the importance of temperament in relation to philosophical thinking. His criticism of this approach is two-fold: one that it is biased towards pragmatism, the American philosophical movement derived from English philosophy which regards practical efficacy and usefulness to be the highest ‘truth’. James was, of course, an adherent of pragmatism. The other criticism is that although James brings the psychological equation into his model, it is concerned only with ‘thinking’. This was, of course, James’s area of interest but nevertheless restricts his model to the study of intellectual capacities coloured by temperament.</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Apollinian and the Dionysian</em></p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Birth of Tragedy</em> was written by Nietzsche in 1871 while he was still enamoured of Schopenhauer whose idea of ‘wills’ Nietzsche was later to reject and replace with his own of the ‘will to power’. Schopenhauer was captivated by the East, which Nietzsche adapted to his own purposes in seeing Greece as the meeting point between East and West.</p>
                <p>In this early work, the portrait of Greece that Nietzsche presents is full of darkness and dread and his contention is that the Greeks had to create the Olympian gods out of the sheer terror and frightfulness of existence which he encapsulates thus:</p>
                <p>Moira pitilessly enthroned above all knowledge, the vulture of Prometheus the great friend of man, the awful fate of the wise Oedipus, the family curse of the Atrides that drove Orestes to matricide . . . all this dread was ever being conquered anew by the Greeks with the help of that visionary, intermediate world of the Olympians. (Jung, 1971: 137)</p>
                <p>In this book, Nietzsche has set out to describe his oppositional pair, which he calls the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Apollinian</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dionysian</em>. He describes them as follows: ‘the continuous development of art is bound up with the duality of the Apollinian and the Dionysian, in much the same way as generation depends on the duality of the sexes, involving perpetual conflicts with only periodic reconciliations’ (Jung, 1971: 137). These two deities were the gods of the arts and in their very opposition they provoke each other to higher achievements—one as the shaper, the other as the Dionysian art of music. ‘Finally, by a metaphysical miracle of the Hellenic “will”, they appear paired one with the other, and from this mating the equally Apollinian and Dionysian creation of Attic tragedy is at last brought to birth’ (Jung, 1971: 138).</p>
                <p>The psychological states that they give rise to are depicted by Nietzsche as <em>dreaming</em> and <em>intoxication</em>. The former, he characterizes as belonging to the Apollinian impulse which produces an ‘inward vision’ and a ‘lovely semblance of dream-worlds’. Apollo signifies limitation and the subjugation of the wild and untamed things in life.</p>
                <p>The Dionysian impulse, on the other hand, means the breaking loose of animal and divine nature resulting in the liberation of instinct. Its manifestation is the satyr, half-man, half-goat that signified the dissolution of humans into their collective instincts. ‘All the artistry of Nature is revealed in the ecstasies of intoxication’ and ‘man is no longer the artist, he has become the work of art’ writes Nietzsche of the Dionysian state (Jung, 1971: 139). The well-known Dionysian orgies are described by him as follows:</p>
                <p>Practically everywhere the central point of these festivals lay in exuberant sexual licence, which swamped all family life and its venerable traditions; the most savage bestialities of nature were unleashed, including that atrocious amalgam of lust and cruelty which has always seemed to me the true witch’s broth. (Jung, 1971: 139)</p>
                <p>Nietzsche’s proposition is that it was the reconciliation of the oppositional forces of Apollo and Dionysus that resulted in the Greek civilization where the antagonism between them is ‘seemingly bridged by the common term “Art”‘ (Jung, 1971: 139). Jung points to this as the central problem in Nietzsche’s thinking which remains stuck in aesthetics. For Jung, the reconciliation between these two forces was not an aesthetic but a religious one and Greek tragedy arose out of a religious ceremony: the cult of Dionysus.</p>
                <p>Aestheticism can, of course, take the place of the religious function. But how many things are there that could not do the same? What have we not come across at one time or another as a substitute for the absence of religion? Even though aestheticism may be a very noble substitute, it is nevertheless only a compensation for the real thing that is lacking. Moreover, Nietzsche’s later ‘conversion’ to Dionysus best shows that the aesthetic substitute did not stand the test of time. (Jung, 1971: 141)</p>
                <p>Nietzsche equated the Dionysian with saying ‘yes’ to life and attacked Socrates in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Birth of Tragedy</em> for his over-reliance on rationalism which upset the balance that had been struck by the ancient Greeks by ‘a metaphysical miracle of the Hellenic “will”‘ (Jung, 1971: 143). As he was still profoundly under the influence of Schopenhauer at the time of writing, the metaphysical will means the unconscious.</p>
                <p>The importance of Nietzsche’s Apollonian/Dionysian opposition for Jung lay in leading him to elaborate his own typological scheme. The Apollinian attitude leads to the production of ideas—in a thinking person it leads to intellectual ideas; in a feeling person it results in feeling-toned ideas. The latter would relate to the idea of freedom, immorality and the fatherland. These two—thinking and feeling - are essentialy rational and logical.</p>
                <p>However, Jung saw that Nietzsche’s model had evolved in a particular way because of the latter’s aesthetic approach to life and from here Jung went on to develop the principles of a third and fourth function - sensation and intuition. These are the nonrational modes of functioning and Jung relates these to Nietzsche’s typology. He was an extreme introvert and an intuitive—Jung deduces this from his lack of rational moderation. His sensation lay repressed in him and he experienced it largely through his intuition which gave him deep insights into the Dionysian qualities in his unconscious.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Prometheus and Epimetheus</em></p>
                <p>Nietzsche’s dyad owes a great deal to the opposition between the Promethean, forward-looking attitude and the Epimethean, backward- looking one portrayed in Goethe’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em>. Goethe’s drama is the medieval version of the one he took from antiquity and adapted to his own time so that it is a medieval Prometheus in the form of Faust, and a medieval Epimetheus in the form of Mephistopheles that confront each other even though it becomes evident that they are the same person. Once again it is the divine wager between good and evil that is being played out.</p>
                <p>The passion that the Greek Epimetheus had for Pandora becomes the diabolical plot of Mephistopheles for the soul of Faust. The Greek Prometheus’s cunning in turning down Pandora becomes in Faust the tragedy of Gretchen and the belated fulfilment of the yearning for Helen. This is the medieval transformation of the worship of God into the worship of woman which denotes the worship of the soul - herein lie the beginnings of modern individualism.</p>
                <p>Faust’s redemption began at his death. The divine, Promethean character he had preserved all his life fell away from him only at death, with his rebirth. Psychologically, this means that the Faustian attitude must be abandoned before the individual can become an integrated whole. The figure that first appeared as Gretchen and then on a higher level as Helen, and was finally exalted as the Mater Gloriosa, is a symbol whose many meanings cannot be discussed here. Suffice to say that it is the same primordial image that lies at the heart of Gnosticism, the image of the divine harlot - Eve, Helen, Mary, Sophia. (Jung, 1971: 188)</p>
                <p>The Promethean defiance of the accepted gods is personified in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em> in the form of the medieval magician: a figure that is pre-Christian and imbued with the pagan unconscious. He is a destroyer but also a saviour who is pre-eminently suited to resolve the conflict of opposites depicted in the drama. In Jungian terms this figure came to be called the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Trickster</em>, the symbolic bearer of an attempt to resolve the conflict of opposites between Prometheus/Epimetheus; Apollo/ Dionysus; Faust/Mephistopheles; conscious/unconscious; introversion/ extra version.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">General Description of the Types</em></p>
                <p>Jung finishes his book with a definition of the two attitudes—extraversion and introversion - and of the four types—thinking, feeling, intuition, sensation. As each of the latter is either extraverted or introverted, this results in eight possible types, i.e. <em>extraverted thinking-, introverted thinking-, extraverted feeling-, introverted feeling; extraverted intuition; introverted intuition; extraverted sensation; introverted sensation</em>. In each instance, an extreme example of the type is on offer in order to give as clear a picture as possible of what is being described. It would be as well to bear this in mind as in reality there are few living examples of pristine types of any of the below.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Extraverted Type: The Conscious Attitude</em> Jung makes a distinction between the conscious and unconscious attitude in both the extraverted and the introverted types. To take first the conscious attitude, Jung has this to say: Tf a man thinks, feels, acts, and actually lives in a way that is <em>directly</em> correlated with the objective conditions and their demands, he is extraverted’ (Jung, 1971: 333).</p>
                <p>In this way, orientation by the object predominates. For instance, the fact that everybody follows a certain mode of fashion at any one time while one person chooses the opposite means that that person is an extravert because their choice is dictated by the outer objective event and not the subjective view. Jung likens the extraverted attitude to Epimetheus who adjusts to the moral standpoint governing society at any one time because for the extravert no other criterion exists. However, as Jung goes on to point out, that does not mean that the extraverted individual is well-adapted as the moral standpoint of a society may in fact at any one point be abnormal. In this way, the capacity for adjustment of the extravert is their limitation as true adaptation means more than a temporary fitting-in with the demands of the moment.</p>
                <p>The danger for the extravert is of being ‘sucked into the object’ with a resultant loss of the self. An extraverted businessperson may be completely taken over by the demands of an expanding business and both the individual’s psychological and physiological needs suffer. This is because even the body is not sufficiently ‘out there’ to be seen as ‘objective’. The end result is usually a compensatory illness or symptoms forcing a change upon the individual.</p>
                <p>The pathological side of extreme extraversion may result in some of the following symptoms. A performer whose fame has reached meteoric heights may experience stage fright and an ambitious person who has over-extended themselves may have bouts of mountain sickness. Jung says that hysteria is the most frequent neurosis associated with this type. This displays itself in some of the following ways: a need to impress others, effusiveness, or a morbid intensification of fantasy life as the libido is forced to introvert to the unconscious.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Unconscious Attitude</em> The unconscious attitude of the extravert will be compensatory to the individual’s total immersion in the object and thus be of a corresponding primitive, infantile and egocentric nature. This is a result of the repression of all the inner impulses of thoughts, wishes, affects and needs which leaves them deprived of psychic energy. What is left over of the latter has a potency that Jung describes as ‘primordial instinct’ and the resultant ‘egoism which characterizes the extra vert’s unconscious attitude goes far beyond mere childish selfishness; it verges on the ruthless and the brutal’ (Jung, 1971: 339).</p>
                <p>Whenever the unconscious emerges it does so in an exaggerated form and in complete opposition to the conscious attitude resulting in a catastrophic collision between the two. Jung exemplifies this with the case of a printer who worked his way up until he became the owner of a successful business of his own, eventually becoming completely gripped by it. The unconscious compensation of this exclusive immersion in his business was a regression to pleasurable childhood memories of enjoying painting and drawing. He then incorporated his infantile fantasies into the business which began to suffer and eventually went downhill.</p>
                <p>Another pathological outcome is that there can develop a dangerous split between consciousness and the unconscious resulting in a nervous breakdown or to substance abuse and addiction. This is the result of the loss of the compensatory function which, instead, turns destructive and there is open conflict between the two realms. Jung’s model also proposes that one function will be superior—i.e. be under conscious control - while the other functions are more or less unconscious and display a haphazard or even primitive character. ‘The superior function is always an expression of the conscious personality, of its aims, will, and general performance, whereas the less differentiated functions fall into the category of things that simply “happen” to one’ (Jung, 1971: 340). The latter do not necessarily manifest only as slips of the tongue or oversights because there is a degree of consciousness attached to them. A telling example of this is the person with a superior extraverted feeling function who has an excellent rapport with everyone but sometimes expresses tactless opinions. The latter spring from an inferior, half-conscious thinking function.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Extraverted Thinking</em> Thinking has two sources: one that stems from subjective largely unconscious data and the other which is a response to objective data as experienced through sensory perception. The extraverted thinking type falls into the latter category and objective events or ideas will be the criteria on which judgment is passed. The direction of the thinking is also important in deciding whether someone is an extraverted thinking. The practical thinking of some scientists, technologists or business people that stem from objective data and have an outward application are examples of this type. So, too, is the philosopher who derives his ideas from tradition or the generally accepted thoughts of the time and the result will represent a higher level of collective facts.</p>
                <p>Extraverted thinking is captivated by the object and can only reach its fulfilment when it is directed into a general idea. In this way, it can come to seem rather banal and if the objective data predominate over the act of thinking, the thinking may become sterile and manifest as a mere Epimethean ‘after-thought’. A pathological outcome of this can be the assimilation of an oppressive amount of empirical material or the ruling object may become the principle by which life is governed. This can result in a form of tyranny over the person and over others within their domain.</p>
                <p>In its extreme form, the compensatory feeling function may be repressed into the unconscious. This would include aesthetic activities, friendship and matters of taste. Non-rational phenomena likewise are repressed, including passion and religious experience - the latter sometimes emerging in a self-seeking form of altruism or ethical stance underlying which is a ruthless pursuit of their own ends using whatever means are necessary.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Extraverted Feeling</em> This kind of feeling detaches itself from any subjective qualities and is orientated only to objective data. Adjustment to the general feeling situation is all-important so a thing will be judged ‘good’ or ‘beautiful’ if it fits with the current view. All collective activity is motivated by this function, examples of this being church-going, fashion, attendance at the theatre and concerts. It has enormous creative potential in this way and, for instance, harmonious social life is generated by extraverted feeling on a large scale.</p>
                <p>The extraverted feeling type will appear to be in harmony with external conditions and will, for instance, choose the ‘right’ spouse or partner in terms of age, social position, income, etc. On an individual level it has a salutary effect until the person becomes assimilated into the object, whereupon the individual quality of the feeling gets lost, leaving a cold ‘unfeeling’ person in its place. Another danger is the emergence of the repressed thinking function which can take the form of obsessive ideas, often of a negative kind.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Extraverted Sensation</em> Jung’s term of sensation is applied to one of the perceiving functions and derives from sensory perception. In its extraverted form it is wholly dependent on the object and concrete processes to excite sensations and its orientation to ‘reality’ is unsurpassed. This latter may be mistaken for an acute rational function but, in fact, there exists no capacity for reflection and sensation types are at the mercy of their sensations, which are irrational. The vulgar extreme of this type will manifest in gross and sensual behaviour but there is also the aesthete who displays great purity of taste.</p>
                <p>This type will be well-dressed, keep a good table and be drawn to the sybaritic life. The negative side of extraverted sensation manifests in crude forms of pleasure-seeking or an unscrupulous aesthetism. In the extreme form, the regressed intuitive function will manifest as a form of grotesque morality or superstitiousness.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Extraverted Intuition</em> Intuition is the function of unconscious perception and is ‘represented in consciousness by an attitude of expectancy, by vision and penetration’ (Jung, 1971: 366). Like sensation, when it is the dominant function it is not mere perception but an active process which puts into the object as much as it takes from it. The extraverted intuitive has a keen nose for anything that is in potential and is always seeking out new possibilities. Entrepreneurs are typically extraverted intuitives and they are known for their enormous energy in starting projects and then cold-bloodedly abandoning them when they begin to feel over-familiar and suffocating.</p>
                <p>His capacity to inspire courage or to kindle enthusiasm for anything new is unrivalled, although he may already have dropped it by the morrow . . . He brings his vision to life, he presents it convincingly and with dramatic fire, he embodies it, so to speak . . . it is a kind of fate. (Jung, 1971: 369)</p>
                <p>The repressed sensation function in this type means that in the extreme form, the extraverted intuitive can never be grounded in the moment but lives always in a world of possibilities and may easily fritter away their life leaving others to reap the benefits of the fruits of their labour. Thinking and feeling may also function in an infantile, archaic way and give rise to suspicious fears and forebodings of illness.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Introverted Type: The Conscious Attitude</em> Perception and cognition are not purely objective but subjective as well and introverts orientate their lives by subjective factors. It is not that introverted consciousness is unaware of external conditions but it responds to them in a subjectively determined way. In this way, the introvert relies largely on the inner impression constellated by the object. Subjective reality is as real as objective and the introverted attitude is largely related to psychic adaptation.</p>
                <p>The introvert derives its conscious attitude from the realm of the collective unconscious or, more specifically, the self. This is then represented in the form of preferences and definite ways of looking at things and usually equated by the individual with their ego. These subjective tendencies are taken to be identical with the object by the individual experiencing them but, in fact, have their origin in the unconscious and are merely released by the effect of the object.</p>
                <p>These perceptions superimpose themselves on all outer objects:</p>
                <p>Thus, just as it seems incomprehensible to the introvert that the object should always be the decisive factor, it remains an enigma to the extravert how a subjective standpoint can be superior to the objective situation. He inevitably comes to the conclusion that the introvert is either a conceited egoist or crack-brained bigot. (Jung, 1971: 377)</p>
                <p>Introverts can come across as inflexible in their subjective pronouncements and as their perceptions stem from the realm of the unconscious, find it difficult to validate their subjective judgements and perceptions. As a result of the merging of the ego with the self, the introvert’s world-creating powers become concentrated in the ego and can lead to inflation and egocentricity.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Unconscious Attitude</em> As the subjective factor predominates in the introvert’s consciousness there is a corresponding devaluation of the object. The opposite state then is to be found here to the extravert’s over-valuing of the object. As a result, the ego may become identified with the subject and increasingly defensive in its approach to objective data. However, it is not an easy matter to deny the power of the latter and the compensatory unconscious attitude of the introvert can become possessed by that power.</p>
                <p>This results in a compulsive unconscious tie to objective data and the ego ends by being enslaved by them.</p>
                <p>The individual’s freedom of mind is fettered by the ignominy of his financial dependence, his freedom of action trembles in the face of public opinion, his moral superiority collapses in a morass of inferior relationships, and his desire to dominate ends in a pitiful craving to be loved. (Jung, 1971: 378)</p>
                <p>There ensues a conflict between the unconscious tie to the object and the conscious feelings of superiority towards the same. The ego becomes increasingly defensive in its relations with objects and the personal unconscious is gripped by powerful fantasies towards them. The end result is a terror of falling under the hostile influence of objects operating in him in an unconscious and archaic way and objects become endowed with magical powers.</p>
                <p>The pathological state associated with introversion is psychasthenia, which is characterized by extreme sensitivity and chronic fatigue.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Introverted Thinking</em> As the following four types are, to all intents and purposes, the opposite of what has been written above about the introverted forms, they will be described more succinctly than those above.</p>
                <p>This form of thinking is primarily orientated by the subjective factor and does not lead from outer experience back to objects. Instead, it begins and ends with the subject. Its intention is to create new views or theories about things rather than to establish new facts and in its extreme form leads to a kind of mystical thinking which is more to do with images than ideas. This can lead to a symbolic approach but if the ego becomes inflated then this access to the unconscious becomes blocked and the result is a ‘veritable “pandaemonium” of irrational and magical figures’ (Jung, 1971: 382).</p>
                <p>Well-known illustrations of the two types of thinking - extraverted and introverted—are Darwin as an example of the former and Kant of the latter.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Introverted Feeling</em> The same things that have been said above about introverted thinking may equally be said about this type except that in this instance everything is felt rather than thought. Objects serve only as stimuli for the kind of imagery that is intensely sought after and all objects that do not fit with this are unheeded.</p>
                <p>The positive aspect of this type is that it appears to the outer world as harmonious, sympathetic and usually in a state of pleasant repose - in summary it may said of it that ‘still waters run deep’. The other side of this picture is that it is given to negative judgements or even a defensive appearance of profound indifference. The form of neurosis associated with this type in its pathological state is neurasthenia which manifests in feelings of exhaustion.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Introverted Sensation</em> Sensory perception is dependent on the object but in the introverted form it is the subjective aspect of the perception that is paramount. Jung places artists firmly in this category and says that if several painters were asked to paint the same landscape, each would be significantly different to the others because of the subjective way in which each would be interpreted.</p>
                <p>Introverted sensation is governed by the intensity of subjective sensation excited by objective stimuli and in its positive aspect comes across as calm and self-controlled. The pathological side manifests itself in a compulsive disorder accompanied by symptoms of exhaustion.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Introverted Intuition</em> The orientation here is to inner objects which are synonymous with the contents of the unconscious. The subjective factor here is dominant and although the intuition may be stimulated by external objects, it is not concerned with them per se but with the impetus this has activated internally. Intuition looks around corners and perceives all the background processes of consciousness, however, in contrast to the extraverted version that continually seeks out possibilities in the environment, the introverted intuitive moves from image to image ‘chasing after every possibility in the teeming womb of the unconscious’ (Jung, 1971: 400). This is the realm of the archetypes, the a priori inherited foundations of the unconscious.</p>
                <p>What intuition shares in common with sensation is that it is a perceiving rather than a judging function so that an aesthetic orientation predominates over a moral one as in thinking and feeling. The negative corollary of this function is that it is often outof- step with the prevailing climate of opinion and is thought of as ‘the voice of one crying in the wilderness’. The pathological neurosis here is that of compulsive disorder accompanied by hypochondriacal symptoms which are the body’s negative way of making itself felt.</p>
