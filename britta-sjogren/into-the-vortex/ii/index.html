        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Prologue: Voices, Vortexes</h2>
        <p>The propositions offered in this book arise from my love of classical cinema—in particular my fascination with those films that bear a female voice-off. Beyond these affinities, it has been my aim to question, refute, and rebut some strongly entrenched theoretical assumptions that have led many feminist (and other) critics to dismiss Hollywood films as invariably and monolithically “male-centered,” as catering to a phallocentric gaze alone, as occluding the feminine, and as containing the woman, and her desire, within not only images that objectify her, but inside narrative structures that constrict and oppress her subjectivity and point of view. These texts need not be looked at so pessimistically. Feminine difference is a positive structuring force within these films—one sustained, rather than stifled, through the apperception of contradiction on the levels of consciousness, point of view, and discourse. Indeed, an orientation that presumes and insists that the woman cannot speak or be heard in the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> may bar us from perceiving ways in which the feminine is represented, eventually suppressing what we seek to find.</p>
        <p>Films from the 1940s possessing female voice-off offer a particularly generative vantage point from which to address these concerns and to rethink prevailing critical perspectives on the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>. More than any other period in film history (aside from the 1970s feminist and other avant-garde movements), 1940s Hollywood <em class="notranslate" translate="no">favored</em> this formal characteristic. Alongside the enthusiastic voice-off experiments of the film noir cycle proper, studios produced a veritable rash of films bearing female voice-off during the ’40s—with a few examples trickling into the 1950s. These films cross genre lines, ranging from melodrama (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>), horror (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Walked with a Zombie</em>), and noir (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal</em>), to gothic (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>) and combat films (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">So Proudly We Hail</em>). Generally popular and classically styled films, they aimed to speak across class and gender, unlike “art” <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> movements, which address a narrower, more elite audience. Produced for general audiences, these 1940s films were tailored particularly to appeal to women. Their themes often directly addressed the home-front experience (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Since You Went Away</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">So Proudly We Hail</em>). Also, through more indirect representations of women facing difficult choices, separation from loved ones, and performing their “duty” under emotional strain (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Humoresque</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All This and Heaven Too</em>), these films often made reference to the challenges newly independent women faced during wartime.</p>
        <p>Though frequently directed by “authors” like Fritz Lang, Max Ophüls, and Joseph Mankiewicz, these films were produced under corporate, capitalist conditions and were thus quite clearly imbricated in the patriarchal system that engendered them. Moreover, most of the ’40s films bearing this formal characteristic (and indeed all of the texts discussed in this book) were directed by men rather than women. Still, this book looks for feminine subjectivity within these films as a <em>positive structuring element</em>, a dynamic contradiction, rather than as a “subversive” thread woven in or “breaking out” of the text, somehow inserted there by a female filmmaker resisting patriarchy behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>Films of the 1940s are of interest in this context precisely because they rise out of a period in which the relation of sound to image might be described as conventionally stable. Whereas in the late 1920s and the early 1930s, Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was still in a state of flux, “adjusting” to the discursive and formal possibilities and challenges ushered in by the introduction of sound, by the 1940s the industry had successfully negotiated this “transitional” phase.1 Thus, this book takes an opposite tack from a feminist position that argues, “if we are to have any hope of finding a break in the hegemony of classical style (silent or sound), a time when a woman’s voice could be her own, we must look closely at a limited period in American film history when the conventions of cinematic representation were for a time in crisis.”2 Indeed, one could say that in the 1940s, the cards were, in a sense, doubly stacked <em>against</em> the possibility for feminine subjectivity to be expressed through voice-off (or any other formal aural component). Not only do films from this period bear the political and discursive limitations imposed generally by a powerful representational monopoly (the studio system), but they are also representatives from an era in which sound’s signifying “difference” had evolved from an awkward and often foregrounded formal “attachment” to a highly conventionalized, firmly integrated element of film form. Thus, the sheer unlikelihood that such films nonetheless offer a space for the feminine to be spoken motivated me, in part, to focus on them.</p>
        <p>Representing the 1940s (or any era) as “stable,” however, is inherently problematic—a generalization that is at odds with the larger spirit of this project. Representation proliferates: meaning is anything but static, despite the presence of stabilizing codes or conventions that may anchor its progress. At any point in history, contradictions—representational, discursive, ideological—exist in tension with a dominant order. On one hand, the choice of this era is decidedly pertinent for this project; on the other hand, one might choose another “era” (a subjective category in itself), a single year, or even a solitary film as an arena within which to study the process by which difference is sustained in film. This is not to say that historical context is irrelevant—any film or group of films potentially examined here would have been subject to the times and conditions in which they were produced. My project, however, is not “historical” in the sense that <em>only these films at this historical point</em> could give rise to the speculations that follow. Rather, these specific films provide an especially apt historical context within which to explore the theoretical issues at stake in this book. They also provide an arena within which to illustrate a method and model of analysis that expressly parts company with a strong feminist tradition that looks to “subversive” film genres, female authorship, formal ruptures, “progressive gaps,” and periods of representational “crisis” in order to find the feminine. This project demonstrates the ways that such discordant elements may structure all films—the ways in which the feminine, too, may structure all films. Certainly, I see the role of sound, and particularly the female voice-off, as a marker of “difference,” an undeniable asset that marks the creative flex of contradiction that runs through the group of films examined here. As Rick Altman has put it, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> changes, and the action of sound is one of the prime reasons for that change.”3</p>
        <p>Still, to assert that historical context plays no role in the selection of these films for this study would be false. Despite their masculine “authorship,” the films analyzed in this book all attempt to address a woman’s subjective experience in some way, reflecting the industry’s efforts to capitalize on the World War II home-front audience’s new spending power. Targeted to this newly dominant, independent female market, these films articulate and respond to a socio-historical context within which the “voice” and the increased discursive visibility of women was a pressing issue. Not only are the narratives generally focused on female protagonists’ negotiations of romantic, psychological, financial, or political problems, but the female voice-off strongly foregrounds the women characters’ speech. There is no pressing need here to revisit the historical circumstances of wartime propaganda and capitalism’s exploitation of women as consumers and second-class citizens. Others have strongly argued to these purposes, with depth and persuasive force.4 Rather, this book looks at these films from another perspective, to consider the problem from the side of the female subject who speaks (and listens) from within patriarchy. In this regard, the appeal of these films to more contemporary audiences is striking, for, clearly, they were not addressed to the women and men who study them today. Yet, as the legacy of feminist film theory since the 1970s plainly illustrates, these films remain compelling sources of pleasure, antipathy, debate, and fascination. (One could even argue that these films are <em>more</em> pleasurable for us today than they were for their intended audiences, for although these were popular films, they were not all successful films: unlike <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>, for example, both <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> were financial train wrecks.5 Whether all these films “spoke” to their contemporary audience is something difficult to affirm. It is clear, however, that these highly contradictory texts speak to <em>us</em>.)</p>
        <p>Their cult-like status for many contemporary theorists was an important consideration in selecting these works. I wanted, on one hand, to propose my theses in regard to films that had been, so to speak, already run “through the mill” and about which, one might fear, there is “nothing more to be said,” with the aim of opening up a fundamentally new way of looking at these canonical texts. Rather than searching out obscure films to render my arguments, I wanted to test them against texts that have, by virtue of their critical “popularity,” proved to be of central importance to the field. On the other hand, I chose these films because of their strong affective pull. I had to question why and how I “loved” these films—whether my subjectivity was at stake or obliterated as I listened to the voices-off that leave such an indelible mark on the mind. Why did I feel that these voices manifested a powerful dissonance, something that I myself could exploit while making films?</p>
        <p>The initial research for this volume coincided with the writing and directing of my first feature film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jo-Jo at the Gate of Lions,</em> and I was deeply absorbed with the tangible challenges facing any feminist filmmaker. Searching for ways to convey feminine subjectivity in film, for strategies to address other women, for a narratological means of displacing a “centered” objectifying point of view, I looked to these classical films as question marks, as sites of problems and possible solutions. My perspective on the issues raised in these pages is thus indelibly marked by the sense of urgency I have felt as a woman trying to “speak” through film. This book reflects, moreover, my longstanding effort to reconcile the infamous divide between theory and practice—a dialectic that has structured my own life as both scholar and filmmaker. As my theoretical interests have propelled my creative work in specific directions, so, too, has my creative work come to influence my perspective on theory. Making films has forced me to look for solutions to problems that theory suggests are nearly insoluble. A remarkable sense of freedom comes from such a dilemma: a certain naïveté allows one to take action <em>as if it were possible</em>. I must assume a woman can speak through film, and that feminine subjectivity can find expression within patriarchy: this stance encourages me to question theoretical truisms I find stifling. My own practical experiments with sound, voice-off, and narrative structure, then, bring me to many of the conclusions I offer in the pages to come. The time I have spent designing, editing, and mixing sound has also rendered me particularly sensitive to the possibilities of sound and voice, and has assisted me in appreciating the complexity of the sound tracks analyzed here. An intricate technology serves sound recording, editing, and re-recording, facilitated by the controlled use of microphones, digital audiotape (DAT), Nagra audio tape recorders, magnetic film, digital editing software, mix boards and the like. Through these tools, these apparatuses, sound is worked, directed, and manipulated; in fact, in a sense, sound is frequently more consciously crafted than the visual image. Where the image often contains many accidental and unforeseen elements that surface within the “real space” where the filming takes place (play of light, weather, etc., especially in on location shooting), the creation of a sound track is more often completely contrived—created artificially in an independent process and composed with elements that were not necessarily present during the filming.6</p>
        <p>Sound thus emerges as a parallel process, powerfully structuring the meanings available to the spectator of a film. It is by way of stressing this “parallel” status of sound, moreover, that the term “voice-off” is used throughout this text, rather than the more traditional “voice-over.” I prefer the term “off,” in part, because it registers an independent space. Whereas “over” suggests a top “layer” or cloak of some kind, “off” connotes otherness— a distinctness that moves alongside, “elsewhere.” In this sense, “off” best evokes the tension of a dialectic to the image, a vital relationship to preserve in descriptions of the voice. Indeed, though the analyses here concentrate on the asynchronous use of the voice, the question of the synch voice is never far afield. I focus on films that stress this apparent separation because they amplify and render more obvious the degree to which all voice—all sound—could be said to be “off.” All sounds, that is, are equally separate from the image track in that they are only “married” in the final instance, brought together in the composite film print: prior to this, they are separate elements which can be “placed” anywhere one wishes relative to the picture. In distinguishing “synch” from “non-synch” sounds as if they are in some ontological way quite opposite from one another, we may be forgetting the artifice of any connection they hold to the image. Synch, in this sense, is an arbitrary concept—for one “synchs up” “non-synch” sounds with as much diligence as “synch” sounds in film production practice. Thinking about synch as also “other” and “off” helps one keep in mind the multiple significations generated by any voice (or sound) during a film viewing.</p>
        <p>In French, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">voix off</em> stands in for any voice which registers as non-synch— whether a narrating voice that is never seen, a voice emanating from a character who stands just offscreen, or an interior monologue expressing the thoughts of a character visible to us. I find this idea useful in responding to the taxonomies of voice that others have prepared before me. Both Mary Ann Doane and Kaja Silverman have taken great care to discriminate between different “kinds” of voice in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>.7 Doane’s categories seem coined by way of preexisting tropes: (1) synch; (2) voice-off (where a character speaks from offscreen but is not seen); (3) interior monologue (where we see the character and hear his or her asynchronous voice); and (4) disembodied voice-over (no visible character or designated diegetic figure—usually found in documentary). Silverman takes these categories and remaps them expressly in terms of “embodiment”: (1) synch sound (which she suggests binds the female film subject to the prison of the objectifying image); (2) the floating voice (one that at times emerges as detached, at others, attached to a specific female body in the film and thus enjoys a certain degree of subjectivity or resistance to classical cinema’s normal vising in on the female body); and (3) the disembodied voice (a voice entirely without visual locus during the course of the film, which Silverman understands to be the most resistant to oppressive patriarchal psychology). The problem of the body that is broached in Doane’s article becomes, within Silverman’s account, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ne plus ultra</em> of the voice—<em>the</em> critical focus of the problem. Hence, Silverman’s schema unfolds as a complex grading of voice embodiments, from “disembodied voice-over” and “embodied voice-over” to (male) synch speech that is “coded” as relatively “exterior” to the diegesis and is thus more “disembodied” than certain (female) voice-overs. Within this demarcation (which Silverman spells out most clearly in her article, “DisEmbodying the Female Voice,” but which she expands with great flourish in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>) an ideal (under a feminist optic) seems implicit in the “disembodied” voice, which, as she describes approvingly, is “freed from its claustral confinement within the female body.”8</p>
        <p>Although all these demarcations are extremely valuable contributions to the field of sound theory (and certainly of great interest), they are also somewhat misleading. The very stratification that these authors point out between “kinds” of voices or “degrees” of embodiment suggests a logic that sees each “class” of voice as bearing intrinsic properties which remain immutable from case to case, film to film, moment to moment. This is not to suggest that either Silverman or Doane uses these categories in reductive or rigid ways. Nor do I wish to throw out the baby with the bathwater: I will refer to these taxonomies at points in this book, as they are particularly useful in helping to “visualize” aspects of the voice’s multiple spatiality in relation to imaged space. The very construction of a hierarchy, however—ultimately implicit in the mappings these theorists have made of the voice—invites us to forget the alterity that is always present, always structuring the asynchronous female voice in film. It is this otherness, again, that I am concerned to preserve and foreground throughout these pages: the residue of difference and plurality of which the voice speaks. A definition like “disembodied voice-over” subordinates supplemental meanings to a primary one (one of distance from the body), discouraging other possible simultaneous, contradictory meanings.</p>
        <p>Separating off the voice into neat divisions may not only close down the play of the signifier: there is also a danger in overdissecting the mechanisms of meaning, inasmuch as we may forget that these categories are merely tools for understanding a larger system at work, a system that is, at the limit, abstract and unbounded. We may begin to believe in an empirical science of voice, or of art. This criticism extends not just to the kind of taxonomies of voice discussed above, but pertains to a whole tendency in much of film theory to isolate meaning. The fabulous and brilliant cognitive schemas proposed by Edward Branigan in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative Comprehension and Film</em>, for example, run the risk of trapping the films he analyzes in a deterministic structure. That is, hierarchical models/deconstructions can ultimately come to “rule” the meaning of the film—confirming, in a sense, what we expect to find, rather than opening onto the unexpected or helping us to change the way we interpret a film. In critiquing such schemas, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have objected to linguists, such as Noam Chomsky, who carve from language <em>constants</em> or “a homogeneous or standard system . . . making possible a scientific study of <em>principles</em> . . . guaranteeing the constancy and homogeneity of the object under study.”9 They claim that these constants are in fact false and “superseded by variables of expression internal to enunciation itself.”10 These “variables of expression,” they go on to say, “are then no longer separate from the variables of content with which they are in <em>perpetual interaction</em>.”11 In other words, in the designation of constants (such as “types of voices” operating in films), we risk losing sight of the process by which meaning is produced, the “perpetual interaction” of voice, narration, editing, the spectator, the image, and the excess that is always part of expression and communication. Without an analytic framework that allows for the unforeseen and for the contradictory exceptions enunciation produces, it is not, indeed, possible to account for <em>change</em>. Thus, to paraphrase Deleuze and Guattari in this regard, it is not that the categories Doane and Silverman offer are too abstract, “it is that [they are] <em>not abstract enough, [they] remain ‘linear</em>.’”12 Linearity, indeed, is a problematic model for the voice, as we shall see. It is in the spirit of change, then, that I embrace abstraction here through this term “voice-off.” Like a talisman of difference, it stands in to remind of all that it simultaneously is and is not.</p>
        <p>Abstract, amorphous, contradictory: the asynchronous female voice in these films constantly fluctuates from one “state” to another. These fluctuations themselves are my quarry—these traverses <em>between</em> the endpoints bounding them rather than the endpoints themselves. I propose, therefore, that it is perhaps pointless to try to pin down a voice as either “off” or “over” according to traditional definitions. It is the very mutability of the voice-off that characterizes it—the way it slips free of the image, glides in and out of its attachments to its apparent body, moving from (in Doane and Silverman’s terms) voice-over to voice-off to embodied voiceover to badly synched sound and back again. Using the term “voice-off” allows one to follow these movements, unbiased by the assumption, for example, that the moment in which a voice seems “furthest” from a body correlates necessarily to a textual point of greater subjectivity. Indeed, a feminist project that looks for instances of truly “disembodied voice-over” in these films is something of a lost project from the get-go. Most Hollywood films from the ’40s that do bear a female voice-off of any narrational weight, in fact, offer at best a “floating” voice, which at times speaks without visible corporeal support and at times is linked expressly to the female body. The only totally disembodied female “voice-over” from this period, according to Silverman, in fact, is that of Addie Ross in Mankiewicz’s 1949 film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em> (a contention open to debate, since we do briefly see Addie’s fragmented body in the middle of the film). Given the categories she sets up, unfortunately, Silverman cannot find evidence of feminine subjectivity in these classical Hollywood films, for her definitions exclude the very possibility. In using the term “voice-off,” then, I hope keep descriptions of this chameleon-like phenomenon from ossifying into predetermined strata, and to keep an open mind about the possibility for any voice—embodied or not—to speak of the feminine.</p>
        <p>Like many feminist films that surfaced in the 1970s and 1980s (such as Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Riddles of the Sphinx</em>, Sally Potter’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gold Diggers,</em> the films of Yvonne Rainer, etc.), for which 1940s films provided a point of reference (if not inspiration), the films discussed in this book encourage spectatorial identification of a feminine order—an “address” to a female audience was implicit in their production.13 The privileging of female voice-off, indeed, in these films seems an obvious textual strategy devised for achieving a certain aesthetic and/or psychological aim. That is, though different assumptions were of necessity made by the different writers, filmmakers, and producers who incorporated the female voice-off into their films, the primary significance of exploiting the female voice as a narrating presence in a film seems grounded in, it is tempting to say, a common assumption of the “essence” of this voice. The female voice seems to “speak” directly to women “from” a female subject. A female character vocalizes her thoughts or feelings to an audience of (assumed) women, and a “hailing” of the spectator is underscored in a way that rarely, if ever, sustains itself on the image track. It is problematic, of course, to suggest that any voice speaks “directly” in culture—ideology would seem to mediate what can be said. A voice represented as both speaking to and for women thus bears interesting social inflections within the wartime era. For instance, did films characterized by female voice-off in the early to mid-forties encourage a feminine consciousness or incite the discursive empowerment of women? Did films of the late forties bearing a female voice-off reflect the respective closing down of the same invitation? It is my view that the contradictions enounced in the discursive operations of these films may be seen as not only formative, but pervasive, in traversing the decade to speak of feminine subjectivity. That is, despite the Hollywood/ patriarchal “agenda” to rope women back into their pre-1940s role, the later films articulate strong ambivalences and conflicting discursive dynamics that remain a legacy of the ascension to speech promised by earlier experiences and prior representations. The female voice-off, in this respect, continues to speak of the female subject even as she is supposedly put to rest; moreover, much of the contradiction, we shall see, rests in the dialectic the voice offers to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</em>. As the work of Laura Mulvey has demonstrated, it is the (male) gaze above all that “seeks” to objectify and contain the woman.14 Whereas many theorists seem to consider the gaze invulnerable to distraction, a monolith agency that always works to contain difference, I contend that the voice offers another perspective, a subject placement that allows for multiple subjectivities, rather than “centering” just One.</p>
        <p>By taking up the female voice-off as the centerpiece of this manuscript, this book counters a number of essays and books dedicated to the soundtrack and the voice in film. While looking over these texts, all brilliantly written and groundbreaking in one way or another, I have been struck by a sense of progression between them, as well as by certain assumptions many of these texts share about the relationship of sound to image, about the subject’s relationship to the apparatus, about point of view, and about narrative itself. It seems clear that the relative dearth of work done on sound by film theorists overall reflects a kind of “poor cousin” status for sound in general: most writers have dedicated the bulk of their work to the “primary” element of film, the image. Many of the authors who have dedicated considerable thought to the problem of sound and voice in film, moreover, seem to have come to a sort of consensus regarding the heterogeneity sound presents to image. Within this “camp” there is, as Edward Baron Turk has put it, a “critical bias towards the visual.”15 Either sound is understood as “just like” the image, though subservient to it in many ways (as in Christian Metz’s writings), or sound is seen as posing a potentially radical difference (as in Doane’s work, and Silverman’s, in particular). This difference, however, is usually (if not always) viewed as constrained by being embedded within the image, “yoked” to a claustral body, or ensnared within narrative interiority. There is an underlying agreement, however, that sound in general and the voiceoff in particular cannot “compete” with the image. For all these theorists, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is, indeed, primarily a <em>visual</em> art.</p>
        <p>I have tried to critique this privileging of the visual over the acoustic register of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in a number of ways. In this endeavor, I am indebted to the pioneering work of a handful of critics and theorists whose writing on sound might be said to fall into a second “camp”—work which postulates sound’s signification in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as at least bearing equal weight to the image, if not more. The importance of Rick Altman’s book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Theory Sound Practice</em>, cannot be overemphasized as a vital perspective not only on the relationship of sound to image, but also on the heterogeneity, dimensionality, and materiality of sound itself. Altman’s own writing and that of others (especially James Lastra and Amy Lawrence, in their own books) recall in important ways the legacy of “silent” <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and the forms of sound and speech that predate and influence the development of sound’s representation in the talkies.16 Moreover, looking back to the origins of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, there is ample evidence that a “purely” visual filmic experience was never produced for, nor desired by, spectators. The representational history of film suggests that the alterity that sound presents to the image has always structured film texts, long before an optical recording was married to the celluloid strip. Beyond this, the fact that the sound demanded by early spectators distracted from the illusory pull of the image helps dislodge the commonsense thesis that sound is secondary since it merely helps to “add realism” to the image. Indeed, this “historical fallacy” about sound, which Altman has resoundingly refuted, is an important buttress to the observations offered in the pages to come.17 My own critique of the primacy of the visible in film studies extends these debates into different ground. Altman, Lastra, and others have offered compelling scenarios of the ontology and perceptual status of sound and provocative histories of its unique representational development. This book is complementary to their work; its focus, however, is elsewhere, given my expressly feminist agenda. This book sees the primacy of the visible in film studies as more than an error. Rather, this “bias” leans, like an ace in a house of cards, on other “biases,” assumptions about the nature of subjectivity and the threat of the body that naturalize and justify much of film theory’s exclusion of the feminine from representability.</p>
        <p>In these pages, I have attempted to situate some of the key issues in sound theory, paying particular attention to the feminist work that engages the terrain of female voice-off. The major debates need to be put into context if one hopes to move onto new ground. In addition to the problem of the relative perceptual and representational value to be placed on sound relative to the image, other questions that have surfaced in both feminist and sound theory remain vital: the “place” of the acoustic subject with regard to the voice; the spatial dimension and perspectival contribution of sound; the relation of voice to language, speech, and discourse; the problem of the body as material origin of vocality; and the textual and ideological implications of synchronization.</p>
        <p>In much early film theory, one finds a predictable and, perhaps, understandable neglect of sound. For instance, Metz’s influential study of the film subject, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Imaginary Signifier</em>, still one of the most imaginative and compelling critiques of the psychoanalytic and ideological implications of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> written to date, offers little assistance in understanding the metaphysical relationship the film spectator may take up in relation to sound and/or voice. Metz undervalues the component of sound conspicuously in his famous dissection of the apparatus. Though the psychoanalytic writings of Jacques Lacan, upon which much of Metz’ work relies, frequently point out critical differences between the scopic and invocatory drives, Metz invariably treats these as identical functions.18 In another article, “Aural Objects,” Metz explores the ramifications of sound more specifically; however, his conclusions betray an unwavering, underlying assumption that the image is always primary.19</p>
        <p>This familiar bias toward the visual surfaces even in texts dedicated to sound and voice in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, most notably and surprisingly in Kaja Silverman’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>. Much of Silverman’s work on spectatorial relations stresses the ways in which the (female) voice is pinned to the image, drawing it as ineluctably corporalized and ultimately doomed to signify as if it were specular. Though she does briefly entertain the idea that the spectator may relate differently to the voice-off than to the image, she discards this possibility before long, at least as far as the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is concerned, concluding that whatever potential exists in the voice-off to address or represent feminine subjectivity is squelched by the implacable textual grip of the male gaze. The interpretations Silverman brings to psychoanalytic paradigms that specifically concern the voice (such as those written by Denis Vasse and Guy Rosolato), moreover, fail to address key concepts these authors offer that open the door onto other ways of looking at how the voice-off may inflect spectatorship. Among these, the metaphor of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">traverse</em> of the voice, which both links the child to the mother (in the womb and after birth) and articulates their separation, has been a powerful figure for me in conceptualizing the spectator’s relationship to the voice-off. Conversely, the term “acoustic mirror,” coined by Rosolato and taken up by Silverman, has unfortunate limitations in describing the voice. This vision-based metaphor cannot adequately capture the most intriguing and provocative characteristics of the voice—its fluidity, its non-specularity, its heterogeneity.20 Indeed, Rosolato’s use of the phrase derives from his interest in the oscillating movement between subjectivities, rather than an intention to cast the voice as a site of specular/imaginary identification. This <em>between</em> can be grasped as a psychological current, a “space” for a non-imaged body, a multiple or shared point of view, an active, dynamic discursive contradiction.</p>
        <p>Given the bias toward the visual component of film and the phallocentric basis of much of Lacan’s writing, the subject is invariably understood within most psychoanalytically informed literature as “male,” “transcendent,” “distant,” “centered.” Such a description obviously derives from the history of visual art, Jean-Louis Baudry’s famous essay on the ideological effects of the cinematographic apparatus, Metz’s compelling theses, and, finally, Mulvey’s groundbreaking essay, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Visual Pleasure and Narrative cinema</span>.” In this scenario, which presumes a transcendent distance to be synonymous with subjective power, an ideological premise can be observed which conflates subjectivity with a position “outside looking on”—a removed, yet central place of authoritative privilege. These values clearly reflect a view of “masculine-coded” subjectivity, one based on the primacy of the phallus as a <em>visible</em> signifier, one that seems unlikely to account for an experience of feminine subjectivity, or for the effect or experience of the acoustic register of film. In looking to the voice-off as an arena relative to which feminine subjectivity may surface, then, I was not in the least disappointed to note that such subjectivity is often linked to positions of textual interiority, to poetry rather than logic, to vortexical narrative movement rather than linear progression. It is my position that, if we want to begin to conceptualize feminine subjectivity, the masculine model will not serve. Indeed, such a model hardly serves even the male spectator, the male subject. The male spectator’s allegedly sadistic gaze has frequently been assumed to be unassailable, a powerful objectifying force. But if sound opens onto heterogeneity, and female voice-off operates to sustain difference (as demonstrated in the following pages), to express contradiction, to signify <em>between</em> male and female, then, I would argue, we also need to look more closely at the schemas that lock men, as well as women, to a depressing scenario that reduces desire to objectification. Feminists, as well as others looking to imagine subjectivity in a less pessimistic vein, need to interrogate this “masculine” model of subjectivity, and to question the valuation of a distanced specular transcendence as the only paradigm within which subject relations may be conceived.</p>
        <p>Joan Copjec has argued, in fact, that this view of the Subject of film, and film theory’s interpolation of Lacan, are not sufficiently psychoanalytic but rather are overly influenced by Michel Foucault’s description of the panoptical gaze.21 Her work has led to emerging theories sensitized to the order of the Real in Lacan’s work, which in turn will doubtless unfold into less ossified models of subjectivity. The notion of consciousness as proposed by both Vasse and Rosolato relative to the voice provides just such a possible alternative paradigm. According to these theorists, the voice is both of the unconscious and the conscious, of the body and of the Other’s body (anterior to the placing of a sexualized value on that body). The recognition of these differences “in” the voice, I argue, may remind of a state in which consciousness of self and Other does not imply dissolution for the subject. Such a voice may enable or incline the spectator to sustain difference, rather than to deny or punish (with a sadistic gaze) the images that accompany his or her sense of heterogeneity.</p>
        <p>My approach, thus, in looking at the sound track and the voice-off of classical film, differs in important respects from those adopted by Metz, Silverman, and others who see the image as primary and the voice as, in a sense, its prisoner. This book disputes this basic assumption about the filmic experience and looks at the female voice-off as a strongly heterogeneous formal element that helps construct the film text along with the image. Neither image nor sound track, I argue, dominates in creating meaning, addressing the spectator, structuring narrative, evoking perspective, or producing discourse. This heterogeneity, sustained, works moreover in a paradoxical, dialectical sense: not by obliterating difference, but in accounting for the existence of contradiction. The dialectical potential of the female voice-off emerges less as a matter of degree of disembodiment effected “between” the voice and the body of the female, but rather more verticality that flexes against the linear flow of standard narrative, the vertical vs. the linear posing, again, a fundamental contradiction. Thus it is my contention that certain indices of signification—linearity and time, rather than circularity and space—have been erroneously privileged as primary in the construction of narrative meaning. Stasis and repetition need not be seen as immobilizing, paralytic influences on female characters within these films; rather, their deviational and often dialectical effect may instead provide a vigorous contradiction to the lure of causal relations that inform forward narrational movement. In this sense, contradiction is formative, rather than hierarchized—both directions move simultaneously in a dynamic expression of difference.</p>
        <p>While looking at the female voice-off, I have taken care to consider its function as voice, not wishing to reduce this phenomenon to the language it bears. However, the important discursive function of the speech borne by the voice, clearly, requires examination. For their part, many of these films seem to be “about” a struggle for mastery over discourse. The very emphasis on the voice “over” the body is pertinent in this respect. In a textual system that generally “pins” the female voice to the female body, their separation, in itself, may be regarded as a radical rupture to the norm, as Silverman has pointed out.22 The female voice-off introduces a tension within the discursive practice of classical Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>. This tension (which may be understood as a subtle undercutting of patriarchal discourse “about and for” women) is evident, for example, in the frequent “point-of-view wars” that characterize many of these films—for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve</em>. Many of these films also link female voice-off to the writing of letters, signaling an effort on the part of the protagonist to take discourse into her own hands.23 The representation of feminine discourse in these films furthermore arrives in concert with a marked textual ambivalence toward the female character whose actions and voice-off have betrayed a will-to-power. Almost all the female characters bearing a voice-off are “punished” diegetically for the degree of subjectivity allowed them within the text. As others have shown before me, women appear to speak only to be elided (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>) or silenced (as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca,</em> where Joan Fontaine’s character speaks less and less freely, or in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kiss Me Deadly,</em> where the price of speech is death). Women in these films, it would seem, “learn,” in the course of the narrative, to “hold their tongue” or suffer the consequences. As I will try to show in the coming pages, however, statements like these are often untenable generalizations. The heterogeneity characteristic of the female voice-off contributes critically to its discursive function in film. One voice can express contradictory discourses, embodying its own paradox.</p>
        <p>These films, that is, may be said to countermand a view of discourse and ideology that understands patriarchal representation as hegemonic, as unassailable and homogeneous, always “containing” difference beneath a strongly worked coherence. Rather (as the writings of Michel Foucault suggest), discourse is constructed through its own contradiction—and this relation is a dynamic process of perpetual renaissance and proliferation of difference. Thus the speech borne by the female voice-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>, for example, enunciates both the patriarchal and the feminine simultaneously. Such films do not constitute sites of one “master” discourse (and certainly not one levied by the image alone) but reflect a dynamic relationship between conflicting desires, disparate discourses, different will-to-meanings. Moreover, the recognition of this contradictory discourse is rendered acute for the viewer in the case of these films produced in the 1940s, which specifically interpolate the “issues” women faced in society as their recent economic empowerment was being whisked away. The voice-off’s address of the contemporary female spectator is implied, not only through the political and social tensions raised by the dialogue in the films, but in the subjective experience of contradiction the voice recreates and the representation of a consciousness of a paradoxical point of view. The specific contradiction of being female in patriarchy, thus, is <em>amplified</em> through the voice-off, in its evocation of a heterogeneous consciousness, of a self that is also other. This experience of sustained difference points to a feminine politic of sorts that exists in dynamic tension with patriarchy. These women’s films speak, that is, of a plurality of voices—of the society within which they emerge, of the subjects they address and attempt to represent, and of their differences. The voice-off speech in these films exacerbates our awareness not only of the constructive force of difference between voice and image, but also leads us to recognize the plurality of subjects who speak, despite and through contradiction, in patriarchy.</p>
        <p>Thus it is as <em>both</em> speech and voice that I will examine the female voiceoff, tracing the movement of these <em>together</em> as they structure the narratives in question. Whereas, frequently, even in studies devoted to voice-off (or “over”) more emphasis is placed on the content of the dialogue, on its overt signification and sense-making inflection relative to the image,24 I will maintain a close vigil on the “other side” of the voice: its grain, its difference, its <em>non</em>-sense. Indeed, this is a tricky process, not easily achieved. For the voice is an elusive subject, and in trying to do justice to its ephemeral and contradictory qualities, I have been as concerned to avoid reducing it to a literary model of narration as I have been to paint it as more than a mere ornament that humbly serves to enhance the meaning dictated by the image. The voice-off works in many, often contrary, directions simultaneously: this is its provocative, intangible paradox.</p>
        <p>Textual analyses of films seem increasingly infrequent in film theory. Specifically, much of the work that has been done on sound (excepting, notably, Amy Lawrence’s) either tends to examine sound’s role in general (if exacting) ontological and historical terms (Altman, Lastra, Levin) or, when couched in reference to film texts, offers only brief examples to illustrate larger principles at work (Silverman, Doane). Indeed, Altman himself has noted that, “. . . ontological claims about the role of sound have been allowed to take precedence over actual analysis of sound’s functioning. . . . It is essential that such speculation not be taken as a prescription, as a binding assumption about the way sound must work in all cases. . . . [We] must depend on historically grounded claims and <em>on close analyses of particular films</em> rather than on ontological speculations that presume to cover all possible practices.”25 I agree with Altman that close textual analysis is critical for an accurate representation of the experience of a film’s sound. Film is a temporal medium, the affect and meaning of which cannot be determined by isolating a few key moments that “illustrate” the whole. Sound, moreover, is less easily reduced to “quotation,” as the image frequently has been in the form of stills. Sound is perhaps more temporal than the image, unable to be indexed through a fragment, requiring us to listen to its traverse across and through the narrative. Sound, that is, has a specific contribution to our experience of film-viewing that merits the same patient articulation the image track has received in innumerable textual analyses produced by scholars since the 1970s. This method, certainly, best suited this book, given my desire to look at voice-off in its textual progression. The close readings elucidated the key issues to be considered here and moved this text in some unforeseen directions.</p>
        <p>The vortexical nature of the narratives in question was one such discovery. This spiraling, internally directed progression that structures so many of the films I encountered while writing this book is a poetic form upon which I have modeled my own methodology. I am concerned, first, to simply elaborate this helixical movement—to articulate its spins, chutes, and curves, and render them poignant to the reader. I also wish to emphasize, through this attention, the formal beauty and poetic complexity of these structures. By demonstrating, through sustained description, how the internal spaces of these films offer deep evocations of character subjectivity, invite vertical signification as against linear, and allow for the rich dissonance of discursive contradiction, I hope to cast doubt on a strongly entrenched view in film studies that such narratives “obviously” work in one way—that is, to “fold” characters into “stasis,” to “pin” their voices to the confines of an objectifying body, to trap them in “claustral spaces,” “regressive positions,” etc.26 Beyond my readings of the films, I have adopted this circular structure as inspiration in elaborating my own larger argument. Though the chapters that follow have a linear arrangement, the issues raised within them inexorably relate back to one another, refracting and spiraling to remind of the fundamental connections between spectatorship, narrative, and discourse. Important, too, in response to authors who have previously tackled these questions, it seems vital to represent their ideas both as part of an evolving field of thought and as texts that must be read vertically themselves. That is, my own writing here embraces repetition, and circles “back” more than once to reconsider ideas and issues in multiple contexts—as does, for example, Kaja Silverman’s analyses of the voice’s relationship to the body in film. I hope in this way not only to avoid reducing the complexity of her arguments to a single “refutable” point, but also to render homage to the intricacy of the issues at stake. The question of the body, like others that will be explored in these pages, cannot be “contained” in a discussion of psychoanalytic registers, but also pertains to textual structure. One needs a simultaneous cognizance of both relations to appreciate how the voice-off works in order to begin to understand the multifaceted question that the body poses. In spiraling round some of the figures who have contributed most to laying the groundwork in studies of the voice, then, I mean to go deeper and deeper into the questions that have engaged them, and now engage me, each time they are reintroduced. I hope also to draw connections between ideas in multiple and even contradictory directions. My dialogue with these authors, indeed, is intended as a dialectic—my criticisms are offered in a spirit of creative contradiction. In this sense, too, I am concerned to take up a position that echoes what I have learned from these films: that as a subject, I may signify from a displaced position—a place of difference that does not obliterate its opposite and that does not privilege one centered meaning. The reflections I offer in this book are a contribution to a larger structure than that embodied in chapters and pages. Each of us who writes, works—perforce—within a vortex of thought that powerfully conveys us in new directions. This book hopes to acknowledge, in its progression, the ideas that made its writing possible.</p>
        <p>Many questions remain lively, still provocative challenges to puzzle out in time. For example, how directly can some of the ideas presented here “transpose” pertinently to films that do not bear a female voice-off? I would argue that films bearing male rather than female voice-off may also exacerbate the consciousness of sustained difference; however, the films discussed in these pages, I feel, most vigorously demonstrate this process. The strong attention to the sound track and the peculiar properties of the female voice-off conspire to create a heightened example of contradiction and paradox. For the purposes of clarity, then, I chose an arena of study that both pleased me aesthetically and supported most compellingly the propositions I aimed to explore. These particular films from the 1940s and the voice-off that distinguishes them were my route leading to the questions that concern this book—the possibility of representing feminine subjectivity in films made within patriarchy, the nature of spectatorial relations to the cinematic apparatus, the dynamic of sound and image, the ideological implications of contradiction, and others. I do not doubt for a moment, however, that other routes may lead to conclusions similar to those I have drawn here, and that other classical films, whether they bear female voiceoff or not, allow the feminine to be expressed in sustained difference.</p>
