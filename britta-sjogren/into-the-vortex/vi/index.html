        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Epilogue: Passionate Blindness</h2>
        <p>I make a distinction between an alienating notion of otherness (the Other of man, the Other of the West) and an empowering notion of difference. As long as Difference is not <em>given</em> to us, the coast is clear. . . . In a way, a feminist always has at least two gestures at the same time: that of pointing insistently to difference, and that of unsettling every definition of woman arrived at. As a Zen saying goes, “<span>Never take the finger pointing to the moon for the moon itself</span>”.</p>
        <p>Trinh T. Minh-Ha, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Framer Framed</em></p>
        <p>Björk’s Selma, in Lars von Trier’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dancer in the Dark</em> (2000), is a contemporary melodramatic heroine—a woman who cannot see, but whose voice carries her to an ecstatic inner realm. In the film, Selma is trapped within a patriarchal system that exploits her as a laborer and misjudges her as a criminal (as it has no access to the logic that drives her actions). Taking cues from the musical genre, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dancer</em> carves out a metaphysical zone of communication with the viewer through the heightened subjectivity Selma expresses in her passionate singing. It is interesting that these vocal eruptions of Selma’s internal consciousness are not introduced until a good thirty minutes of the film have passed. In fact, much of the narrative work up to this point involves establishing Selma’s encroaching blindness—and effecting a spectatorial relationship with her that progressively detaches her character, so to speak, from the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>. This detachment results both in disempowering her (she cannot see, she is vulnerable to the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>of others) and in dislodging her from the “<span>trap</span>” of vision within the cinematic syntax. Selma seems to float in a space parallel to other characters, her eyes turned inward, her focus on another plane, and her figure posing a riddle to an image that does not serve to represent her. This parallel strata within which Selma’s character dwells is underscored by numerous techniques in the film: the handheld style, as rendered in digital video, for example, has an effect of keeping vision off-kilter, stressing a pixilated, fragmented, and unstable vision, making us share a blurry capture of the world. Depth of field is severely racked to create a shallow, and indeed, extremely unstable range of focus within nearly every shot of the film. In short, the image itself is under siege in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dancer</em>, emerging as a register where the denizen of sight, the camera, cannot quite grasp what is “<span>there</span>”.</p>
        <p>The characterization of Selma also contributes to the establishment of her “<span>difference</span>”, her inhabitation of some other realm. An odd mix of woman and child, an asexual sprite, a holy fool, a saint, a daydreaming naïf happily at play in her own world, she is regarded with a mix of awe and exasperation by the other characters, who cannot follow her where ever it is she “<span>goes</span>”. Indeed, initially, neither can the viewer, though we are told over and over in the first third of the film that she daydreams, a habit that is our first sign of impending peril for this character. In fact, it leads to her distraction at the factory where she works. In these early scenes, Selma constantly seems on the verge of some horrible physical accident. When she is finally injured (during the first song/dance sequence daydream), we realize that the portent of physical peril was a ruse, a narrative strategy to establish a general anxiety for her person. All that happens is a cut finger. Of course, this wound is also the first step toward her eventual execution (and the first narrative event to depict the callousness of the “<span>system</span>” toward someone who is, in the words of the trial lawyer, “<span>handicapped</span>”; whether Selma’s handicap is blindness or lack of control over her internality is an interesting question raised by the film).</p>
        <p>It is not until Selma sings that we see “<span>inside</span>” her. Coincidentally, she does not sing until her sight has finally completely failed her. Her voice opens onto another realm of perception, which we understand to be triggered by the loss of her outward <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>, and by the creative invocation of an internal vision she summons into acoustic space—a vision that has little to do with <em>sight</em>. If elsewhere, in films celebrating the offscreen voice, “<span>blind images</span>”, gaps in the image track, represent the internal feminine <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>, here we see into the blindness, grasp what it “<span>looks like</span>”. Thus, the musical scenes function as windows into the invisible world of Selma’s consciousness.</p>
        <p>The sudden eruption of the interior landscape of Selma’s mind represents a register of sound, and particularly, of voice that only Selma (and the viewer) can access. A privileged communication, this fantasy serves to link our perception to Selma’s, and to establish the limitations imposed by the external vision that rules the consciousness of the other characters. Though the other characters participate in the dancing and singing, they do not seem to perceive what they are doing. This is not their fantasy. They are “<span>directed</span>” by Selma/Björk, doing and saying the things that she would prefer to be real. When the numbers conclude, these characters seem untouched by the experience, while Selma is profoundly affected, as are we. These sequences, moreover, contradict the “<span>image</span>” of Selma that reigns in the rest of the film. Visually, they are shot and timed for a highly saturated color, and they contrast vividly with the drab grays and browns of Selma’s “<span>real</span>” world. This is a passionate environment, altered by Selma’s subjective perception. Within these scenes, too, Selma, takes on a different persona—the center of attention, a diva with a majestic (rather than “<span>funny</span>”) voice. She performs a range of intense and compelling emotions, expresses her sexuality as her body responds pleasurably to the sound she is producing, and projects a sophistication, intelligence, and energy that drains from her elsewhere in the film. The eroticism expressed by Selma in these scenes, however, seems remarkably transgender and is certainly not a response to her delight in her own body (as when Gilda dances). Rather, here, the body, like the mind, is turned inward in pleasure—it vibrates to the voice rather than responding to a sexualized <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>.</p>
        <p>In one sense, the musical scenes convey Selma’s fantasy that she is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Björk</em>—drab reality is merely a fatal mistake, and the unassuming factory worker is “<span>really</span>” a charismatic pop superstar. Another repercussion of these sequences is to establish a narrative and discursive paradox to the grim and relentless melodrama that conducts Selma’s guttersnipe persona to the gallows. Indeed, there is even a generic conflict here established between the conventions of the musical and those of the melodrama. The film itself continually references musicals and the lyrical escapism of song and dance in the movies. Yet, the use of the voice in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dancer</em> might be described as overwhelmingly in the service of pathos, as befits the melodramatic plot per se. In this sense, the film has much more in com mon with the narrative weight and sublime musical effect of opera than with the slight, silvery worlds inhabited by Fred Astaire, or concocted by Busby Berkeley.</p>
        <p>These sequences give access to Selma’s ecstatic being, her libidinal self, her desire, her erotic self-image. They cut across the film’s more “<span>objective</span>” portrait of her as a timid, closeted wretch, and show the breadth and depth, instead, of a secretly vast experience of life. Suddenly, Selma is a subject, empowered and freed from the alienating objectification that is her working-class persona. Like the lovers in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Enchanted Cottage</em>, her “<span>real</span>” inner world, inaccessible to “<span>external</span>” vision, confers a subjective “<span>truth</span>” upon her figure and renders her person as what she <em>feels</em> rather than what she <em>is</em>—inaugurating an idea of perception as spiritual, rather than biological. The fact that Selma does not need her glasses within these sequences points out the aphysical nature of the vision in sway here— without them, we know, she cannot see—at least not what is physically there. To see what is not visible, that is, glasses are superfluous.</p>
        <p>The effect of these sequences is to change how we view Selma in the more linear story from which these sequences spiral. We now “<span>know</span>” that she is never (only/ever) experiencing what we see in the “<span>exterior</span>” world that so abuses her (she is not “<span>there</span>” in the image but drifting in a paradise of sound from which we are temporarily excluded). The image is exposed as lacking, barring access to the internality the voice has opened onto. The singing scenes also inaugurate the vital contradictions that now define her character: she is thereafter weak and powerful, wretched and glorious, trapped and free. She comes, via the sublime refraction of her song, to embody paradox. It is the voicing of her desire within these sequences that alters her character and opens her onto this lively contradiction, which, indeed, comes to fruition in this film as an essential challenge to being that can only be resolved on a spiritual (rather than a physical) level, as we shall see. Selma becomes what her voice expresses about her, metamorphosing into the powerful tragic diva latent in her songs.</p>
        <p>These sequences, though coded as fantasy in their referencing of musical film conventions, simultaneously emerge as more “<span>real</span>”, in a sense, than the scenes meant to signify “<span>reality</span>” as such within the film—for the musical numbers respond to an extratexual demand for Björk to perform. Björk’s voice is the space of cinematic desire here, a desire that arguably works counter to any fetishization of her image. While Björk’s body is cloaked under drab, frowsy dresses, and her <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>and that of the viewer are blocked by the impassive, refractive opacity of her lowered lids, her voice opens onto freely circulating eros. Moments of digression from the narrative, only apparently structurally “<span>static</span>”, these musical sequences in fact drive the pleasure-seeking motor of this particular text. The pop star’s legendary incantatory wails float out of the character Selma’s mouth, producing an acoustic rhapsody for which her fans, at least, have been waiting. In this sense, the paradox of Björk herself inhabits these scenes— and the voice of the star is heard separate from, yet also within, that of the character.</p>
        <p>The “<span>difference</span>” then, heard in this particular voice, creates a gap between performer and character as both are represented by the imaginary acoustic figure on screen. There is a strong work on the part of this narrative, moreover, to close this gap, to join these voices, to attach Björk’s voice to Selma’s body, to identify it as Selma’s, rather than as belonging to the extra-diegetic pop star. This progressive apparent unification of the two vocal bodies takes place as a movement from asynchronicity to synchronicity. The early musical sequences, that is, where Selma sings in the factory and again on the train tracks, follow an MTV practice of postsynchronization of her singing. The voice is almost a voice-off, “<span>dubbed</span>” over the images to appear in synch, laid over the cuts for an illusory impression of continuity and smoothness. Such a voice, again, brings us nearer to Björk and to her persona as star and performer, separating us, subtly, from Selma’s character at the very moment in which her internality finally sounds. This performance is not stressed as a rendition sung by Selma (as it would be more clearly if sung in sync by the “<span>character</span>” on the set, surrounded by the acoustics of diegetic space). Moreover, as we know, other characters in the diegetic space cannot hear her. In fact, like most forms of voice-off, this voice is directed largely at the viewer, the privileged recipient of the song. The very voice that carries the subjectivity of Selma to us, thus, simultaneously invokes our sense of her split, of her disconnection from the “<span>real</span>” of the film text, and reminds us of who she “<span>really</span>” is—Björk, singing what Selma feels.</p>
        <p>Once Selma has been imprisoned, this “<span>distance</span>” between the voice of Selma and that of Björk narrows. In her cell, Selma sings a rendition of “<span>Raindrops on Roses</span>”, mournfully crooning next to the ventilator shaft, where hymnal strains from the chapel have brought the requisite inspirational rhythms to her ear. This scene, unlike the preceding songs, is not post-dubbed but rather is pieced together from Björk’s improvisational synch performance. As such, edits between shots are more noticeable, and vocal phrasing has a halting, wavering, tortured tonality. Only the faintest musical accompaniment breathes under Björk’s voice here, as opposed to the sweeping, cathartic strains that swell in other scenes. The effect of this new “<span>synch</span>” status to the voice (reprised in the final “<span>next to the last</span>” execution song) is to solidify the apparent unification of star with character, of Björk to Selma. The “<span>gap</span>” between them closes, as does the gap between voice and body, as the voice is formally “<span>yoked</span>” to the image. In this she is a good example of a voice that has been “<span>pinned</span>” to a body, after initially enjoying asynchronous freedom. And while a degree of “<span>claustral constraint</span>” is indeed implied (even fairly overtly by the plot of the film itself), this subtle metamorphosis simultaneously conveys an enhanced expression of Selma’s internality. On one hand, Selma’s physical imprisonment is stressed—she suffers a loss of imaginary mobility enhanced by the limitation, now, of sound to screen space. But with this physical constraint a greater metaphysical, or spiritual, freedom seems accessed by the character. In these scenes, finally, Selma “<span>really</span>” sings— the voice she possesses, and which possesses her, is no longer a fantasy, but her own. Strapped to the board in the hanging room, Selma now also has an “<span>audience</span>” (albeit a grim one) in the witnesses who have come to watch her die, but who first will hear her sing. Finally, her voice affects others—they stare at her in wonder at the sound she produces, and the kindly prison guard turns her head in a sympathy of emotion on hearing Selma’s tones. Thus, in this final “<span>pinning</span>” of Björk’s voice to Selma’s body, Selma finds her greatest subjective power—moving others as she has been moved, expressing an internality that has been locked inside her for the bulk of the film, traversing her otherness to find solace in the passion her voice creates. That Selma’s redemption comes at the price of her life, and indeed, of her voice (she is silenced by patriarchy—a fact that is underscored by the stripping of the sound track once she is hanged) does not alter the power of her subjective expression. Like Lisa in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>, her scripted fate is determined by social reality. Yet her voice speaks here of a transcendent ascension within which her suffering becomes publicly recognized, becomes a form of art. Indeed, this silence is the “<span>other side</span>” of the voice, rendering it in its very absence as a profound reminder of the paradoxes that surface across the textual field of this film. The heterogeneous consciousness between Björk/Selma and the viewer is sustained, a feminine subjectivity expressed, and a feminist discourse articulated, alongside the more obvious patriarchal forms and meanings also structured into this film, as we have seen in the other films discussed in this book.</p>
        <p>Reading <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dancer in the Dark</em> metaphorically, we can define difference, in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>at least, as an ecstatic divide created, traversed, and culminated in the female voice. This film, which cannot be tied to a feminist author, and which bears a contradictory ideology, nonetheless allows for an evocation of a transcendent subjectivity associated to the female pro tagonist. The filmmaker, Lars von Trier, indeed may not have even intended such subjectivity to emerge. While von Trier’s film is clearly absorbed with the question of female voice, this is not to say that it is a self-consciously feminist film. I will not extrapolate at length on the film’s patriarchal “<span>side</span>” (a harsh condemnation of Selma’s naïveté and passivity), which is not difficult to perceive. In this way, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dancer</em> provides a contemporary corollary to the other texts discussed in this book: strong contradictions are at work within it, and patriarchal underpinnings move in active paradox to an evocation of feminine subjectivity. Still further, the expression of such a transcendent subjectivity is due precisely to these powerful paradoxes created and sustained by the foregrounding of the female voice within the film. The female voice has a pronounced relationship to asynchronous, heterogeneous signification and it establishes tension to the objectification posed by the image. It brings forward representations of internality, consciousness, and vortexicality in opposition to contrary discursive modes. This book offers a method for approaching such difference, a method that I hope will serve to open up new debate in feminist studies of film generally, and, more specifically, about the potential for films to represent or communicate difference in positive, rather than negative, terms.</p>
        <p>Within these pages, a number of criticisms have been brought forward in regard to canonical texts in the field of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>studies. My intent, in reexamining these vastly influential works, is in no way to dismiss their undeniable contribution to both film studies and feminist film theory, but to suggest that, unfortunately, the very seeming invincibility of some of these writings may have led us to prematurely consider the “<span>case closed</span>” on some particularly thorny issues. A number of problems need now to be explored in new directions, to be reconceptualized, the relationships between them rethought, and the ideological assumptions that underlie them reconsidered. In particular, my charge, while writing this volume, was to consider whether feminine subjectivity can be expressed in the classical Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>despite the objectifying force of the image. A strong legacy within the field implies that such representation is muffled at best: a deep pessimism rules the bulk of work that has been conducted in this arena. In this respect, I suggest, feminists writing about film may have painted themselves into a theoretical corner. An intimidating edifice of assumptions has been constructed regarding the nature of subjectivity itself, the primacy of the image over sound in representational weight in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, the importance of causality and linearity over stasis and circularity within narrative, the “<span>external</span>” place from which enuncia tion and discursive authority emerge, the inviolate dominance of patriarchal ideology, etc. Studies of voice, and particularly female voice (to which many minds were turned in the late 1980s and early 1990s, along with sound generally, as a potential arena within which a feminist critique of the image might emerge), have functioned to bolster this edifice, rather than to question it or overturn it. The result, in fact, has been a retreat from feminist theory in film studies in general—for where is the pleasure in reminding oneself of the futility of one’s work, in repeating a depressing analysis, within a new context, perhaps, of a process of repression and objectification that has been “<span>proven</span>” a million times over, and which forces the female writer into an absurd position in which she must acknowledge she is not a subject?</p>
        <p>My goal, in writing this book, then, was in part to counter this stultifying system of assumptions with a more open structure, one that might allow for alternative interpretations of a number of these vital, and fundamental theoretical questions. To the question of subjectivity, I have offered an alternate reading of psychoanalytic texts that account for the workings of voice and consciousness in allowing for the sustaining, rather than the foreclosing, of feminine (or other) difference. Critiquing the hierarchy implicit between image and sound tracks in determining cinematic representation, this book extends important work on sound done by Rick Altman and others into the specific terrain of the voice-off and its effects. Questioning narratological work that identifies causality and linearity as progressive textual features promoting access to character subjectivity, I have looked to the constructive force of vertical narrative movement, temporal spirals, digressions, and inward circling repetition as symptoms of a vortexical, paradoxical advance, wherein contradictions construct and evoke a simultaneous perception of the complex spatialities and temporalities of narrative. Finally, this book suggests that contradictory, plural discourses can be expressed simultaneously within representational forms produced in patriarchy.</p>
        <p>This book also seeks to reopen the door onto the study of sound, and of the voice in particular, by feminists and others concerned with understanding the representation of women in film. Within this manuscript, I locate the female voice-off as a particularly powerful formal feature that provokes an awareness of heterogeneous consciousness, plural point of view, and discursive paradox within a number of classical texts that might seem, due to their mode of production, authorship, and conventional form, unlikely to promote or sustain difference. However, the voice is only one aspect of the sound track that, as others have pointed out before me, is excessively complex, has been sorely misrepresented in much film theory, deserves the same kind of ardent detachment that has spawned so many important reflections on the functioning of the image of film, and is ripe for further theoretical and critical exploration along many avenues.</p>
        <p>The methodology adopted in this book, moreover, by providing close textual analysis of the films discussed, is likewise motivated by a sense that the merits of this approach to analysis have been prematurely rejected, with the advent of cultural studies and its valuable contribution to film theory. The method illustrated within these pages is intended to emphasize the importance of a sustained examination of the fabric of any cinematic text. In this temporal medium the progressive structuration of meanings across the text need to be carefully observed in all their relations.</p>
        <p>This book, in short, tries to “<span>unsettle</span>” the definitions that have become “<span>self-evident</span>” within the field, while at the same time, as Trinh T. Minh-Ha puts it, “<span>pointing insistently to difference</span>”.1 As a woman both writing about film and making films, the desire to find a space within which difference could empower rather than paralyze me catalyzed the theories that I have offered here. Difference can be understood as a forcible voicing of contradiction, as heterogeneity sustained as consciousness, as perspectival plurality, as an affirmation of discursive antilogy. Viewed as a dynamic, difference can be said to be both represented and sustained within even classical film texts, which most feminist film theory has written off, pointing to mechanisms of fetishization, objectification, repression, and misogyny that foreclose feminine otherness. This fundamental dialectic of image to sound needs to be reassessed by film theory. The female voice-off in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, in particular, articulates and exacerbates our awareness of the constructive force of difference. It opens perception onto a space of positive paradox, within which contrary meanings are recognized simultaneously, and in relation to which subjectivity itself can be understood outside traditional models which center an ideal of male transcendent vision. As such, the voice-off offers us a way of reconceiving difference itself and allows us, indeed, to reassess the place of the feminine in film.</p>
