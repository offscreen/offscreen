        <p>1. Bordwell et al. have argued that, relatively speaking, the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">crisis</span>” sound posed was minimal—as little as a two-year period of representational upheaval. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Classical Hollywood</em>, 301–8. Certainly by 1935 the formal importance of sound in film would seem securely entrenched—for by this date “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the supervising dubbing mixer attained about equal rank with the editor of the picture</span>” in the postproduction hierarchy. Stewart, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Evolution of Cinematic Sound,</span>” 49.</p>
        <p>2. Amy Lawrence refers here to films from the early sound era—the class of films frequently referred to as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">hybrids.</span>”  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,71.</p>

Renov’s  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood’s Wartime Woman</em>and Doane’s  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Desire to Desire</em>are two excellent explorations of the historical conjunction of wartime propaganda and women’s films. Whereas Doane is interested in the rise of consumer culture and its impact in brainwashing women into identification with popular-culture imagery, Renov links the Hollywood machine to that of the War Office, in examining the repercussions of the war on both real and represented women.</p>

        <p>6. Obviously, many films do not fit this generalization. Some films, shot on sound-stages with artificial sets and the like, might be said to bear highly contrived image tracks—eschewing the accidental details that the real offers and that so many filmmakers embrace as one source of the sublime in film. Likewise, some filmmakers abhor the artificially composed sound track. The point here, however, is simply to remind that creating a sound track requires  <em>at least</em>as much deliberation as putting together the image.</p>

        <p>13. To clarify here—my use of the terms “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">feminine,</span>” “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the female subject,</span>” and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">women</span>” within this text is based on the following assumptions: the feminine relates to the psychoanalytically constructed subject (usually women); the female, the biological subject; and women, historical subjects. There is still the problem of defining what one means by “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">female voice</span>”—part of the object here, indeed, is simply to clarify and propose a tangible, useful way of conceiving this term relative to film. On a superficial level, and in order to facilitate a means for entering into a discussion of such complex issues at all, the notion of the female voice will be thought of as generally the voice one assumes is produced by a female, but also one that relates to the feminine subject (as in how the feminine speaks through the female) as well as to women (for speech is always political).</p>

        <p>16. Altman’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Space</span>” (46–64) traces the representational legacy of radio, phonography, theater, and public address as representational systems upon which evolving sound cinema “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">leaned</span>” while developing its own “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">new form of representation.</span>” Lawrence is particularly interested in the ideological imprint of the history of phonography, in which she sees a bias  <em>against</em>the female voice that marks it as a troubling signifier in the nascent sound film. Lawrence,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,11–34. Lastra looks to silent cinema itself as the discursive system that provides the  <em>codes</em>by which sound represents itself in film.

        <p>20. Rick Altman’s work (especially “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Material Heterogeneity,</span>” 15–31) offers rich inspiration for thinking about the complex dimensionality and materiality of sound. The voice-off embodies a similar “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">material heterogeneity,</span>” while bearing other unique characteristics not necessarily applicable to all sound.</p>

        <p>23. A number of films from this period that bear little or no voice-off offer some interesting parallels to these films. They highlight women’s speech or feminine discourse through other pronounced means, such as the obsessive production of and (re)reading of letters in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All This and Heaven Too</em>.Amy Lawrence (in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,109–46) has analyzed this same tension with regard to a condition of muteness contrasted with hyperverbosity ( <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Spiral Staircase</em>) and obsessive telephoning ( <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sorry, Wrong Number</em>).</p>
        <p>24. The work of both Kozloff and Smoodin, heavily influenced by the narratological theory of Gérard Genette, bears vestiges of this tendency.

        <p>8. The word “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">uncanny</span>” is often deployed in descriptions of voice (and voiceoff) in cinema, and indeed is apt. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Unheimlich,</span>” according Freud, designates opposite meanings simultaneously. The “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">strange</span>” and the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">familiar</span>” co-signify in this word as though they were one: the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">uncanny</span>” is paradoxical.

        <p>17. Baudry points out the importance of visual precocity in the child after birth. But the child has already been hearing for quite some time. Thus, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">auditory precocity</span>” must be at least as powerful, if not more so, than the visual capabilities of the child even as it is born. Ibid., 294.</p>
        <p>18. Ibid., 295.</p>
        <p>19. Branigan has pointed out the slipperiness of this term, which has transmogrified in film theory from a role of an “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">object</span>” that records reality to a metaphor for primary identification, and finally, to “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">a reading hypothesis about space.</span>” “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">What Is a Camera,</span>” 97. Interestingly, no such all-encompassing mechanical metaphor exists for the producing apparatus of sound. We never talk, for example, about the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">mike</span>” as if it were the sound track or, alternately, the listener’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">ear.</span>”</p>
        <p>20. Williams leans on Baudry’s  <em>other</em>famous essay, in which he draws an analogy between cinema and Plato’s allegory of the cave. In this essay, Baudry does touch on sound to assert both that it is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">more real</span>” than the image (“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">reproduced and not copied</span>”) and, in a point Williams leaves dangling, that it  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">introduces ambiguity</em>.This ambiguity would seem to be at cross-purposes with much of Williams’s critique of Baudry. It is, however, very much in line with my own reading of the voice as raising contradictions to the image, rendering its meaning unstable in important ways. Baudry, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Apparatus,</span>” 110; Williams, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Is Sound Recording,</span>” 51–66.</p>
        <p>21. For a fascinating overview of the evolution of the debate on whether sound is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">perfectly reproduced,</span>” suffers no ontological distortion, or has only a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">partial,</span>” “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">distorted . . . correspondence to the original event,</span>” see Lastra’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Reading, Writing,</span>” 65–66.</p>
        <p>22. See, for example, McClary’s  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Feminine Endings</em>,which explores the structuring representation of sexual difference in music. The groundbreaking work of Altman and Lastra brings the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">point of audition</span>” of the subject into relief. See Altman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Space,</span>” and Lastra, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Reading, Writing.</span>”</p>
        <p>23. Williams acknowledges moreover in his essay that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">for the purposes of simplicity, I am assuming a recording made with only one microphone.</span>” Williams’s argument depends, unfortunately, on a premise that severely misrepresents the standard practices of sound recording technology in film, limiting its usefulness. Williams, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Is Sound Recording,</span>” 53.</p>
        <p>24. Ibid., 53.</p>
        <p>25. Altman has pointed out the importance of considering the role of  <em>reverberation</em>in appreciating sound dimension. See Altman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Material Heterogeneity,</span>” 24, 27–28.</p>
        <p>26. Though many technicians in the early 1930s apparently resisted this multiplicity, which they felt created a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">monster spectator</span>” with “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">five or six very long ears, said ears extending in various directions,</span>” it evolved into common practice by the late 1930s. Today, mixing between different mikes frequently occurs during the original recording of sound as well. See Altman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Space,</span>” 49.</p>
        <p>27. He goes on to remind that because of these particular characteristics, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no"> <em>no</em>microphone produces an entirely faithful sound record.</span>” Altman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Material Heterogeneity,</span>” 26.</p>
        <p>28. Experimental films, of course, blur these distinctions—often with the express purpose of disrupting the codes of transcendent spectatorship critiqued in these pages. There are also moments in many classical films in which we do perceive more than one image angle at a time—notably, superimpositions and dissolves. In fact, these decentering visual pluralities mark an intriguing correlation in the image to the contradictions posed by sound. They operate in ways similar to the female voice-off in creating a consciousness of difference for/in the spectator.</p>
        <p>29. Altman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Space,</span>” and Lastra, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Reading, Writing.</span>” Both these articles are fascinating and complicated, and I cannot completely do them justice here. Lastra’s article leans heavily on Tom Levin’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Dimension.</span>” Levin extends Williams’s demonstration that sound is a representation rather than a reproduction. He argues (among other things) that sound is always transformed by the technology that reproduces it. We can never hear, that is, the sound as it was in the original space. It only seems the same to us because of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">a socially constructed auditory practice that emphasizes the similarity of such sounds in order that they can be understood . . . by the hearer.</span>” Levin, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Dimension,</span>” 62.</p>

        <p>31. As Metz defines it, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">identifying with one’s look is . . .  <em>primary cinematic identification</em>,</span>” implying (by default) that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">identification with one’s hearing</span>” is not primary (and possibly not cinematic). Even secondary identification (identifying with characters) in his schema is linked to vision—through point-of-view shots, for example.

These benshi-like commentators, in turn, represent a continuation of the ballad-singer who toured rural festivals and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">declaimed in a singsong manner</span>” a story implied by a series of paintings.

        <p>55. Tom Levin underscores this dialectic when he claims that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">[t]he history of the development of cinema sound can . . . be read as an oscillation between its difference understood as supplement and its difference understood as threat.</span>” Levin, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Dimension,</span>” 63.</p>

        <p>57. Belton, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Technology and Aesthetics,</span>” 66. Levin’s work also points to the pleasurable affect of the sound/image dialectic. He cites Adorno and Eisler in postulating that the acoustic register’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">spatial dimension</span>” contributes to the  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">aura</em>(“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">A-effect</span>”) that simultaneously brings out the  <em>difference</em>between sound and image. Fascinatingly, Adorno and Eisler were most interested in sound in that they felt it “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">foregrounds the  <em>mediated</em>character of the visual register</span>”— they understood the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">acoustic supplement [as potentially] threaten[ing] to discredit and even displace the visual domain it was meant to support and strengthen!</span>” Levin, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Dimension,</span>” 63; emphasis in the original.

Haraway,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Primate Visions</em>,41.</p>
        <p>73. Silverman’s revaluation of the visible signifier of feminine difference as not  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in itself</em>lacking (rather representing a repository where masculine lack can be worked through) suggests that the sex of the viewer/spectator may indeed bias or determine the  <em>reading</em>of the  <em>image</em>(and, in this scenario, not “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">being</span>” the lack, the female spectator may indeed perceive her specular counterpart differently than a male spectator).</p>
        <p>74. See Silverman,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Mirror</em>,119–26. Silverman “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">replaces</span>” the pre- Oedipal “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">chora</span>” postulated by Kristeva as the time of desire between the little girl and the mother with this Oedipal moment she links to the entry into language. In fact, Silverman suggests, there are  <em>two</em>Oedipal crises/desires—one negative and one positive—between which the female is destined to oscillate. Silverman suggests that these two desires “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cancel each other out,</span>” calling them “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">irreconcilable.</span>” She stresses that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">desire for the mother can never be anything but a contradiction</span>” (Ibid., 123). Since I see contradiction as a site of flex, of positive paradox, I am inclined to view this description of female desire as refreshingly reversible and fluid, allowing for difference even in the self, rather than self-annulling.</p>

Silverman, however, points out the negative thrust of his vocabulary only to posit it as, on some level, appropriate to the kinds of films he is discussing—an accurate rendering of the state of things in “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood.</span>” However, in this respect Chion is much more “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">democratic</span>” than Silverman is—fairly impervious to historicity or genre in his analyses, he flits from classical cinema to Duras to Mizoguchi and back again in painting his absolutist portrait of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the voice.</span>” Thus whereas Chion rather randomly mobilizes both this image of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">umbilical night</span>” and its opposite “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">fantasy</span>” (the soothing maternal voice that wraps the subject in a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">sonorous envelope</span>” drawn by Rosolato) relative to both classical and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">alternative</span>” cinema, Silverman erects a wall between Hollywood and feminist filmmaking, implying that in one, female voice-off works one way; in another, it works quite differently. In this sense, she seems overly dismissive of one cinema and idealistic about the other. Thus, despite Chion’s less than rigorous historiographic approach, he seems more in touch with the workings of individual films. See Chion,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Voix</em>.</p>

        <p>82. Ibid., 67. Silverman’s suggestion that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Hollywood draws . . . upon the paradigm of female sexuality championed by . . . [Ernest] Jones [which equates] woman’s voice with her vagina</span>” leads to her conclusion that via these sites “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">subjectivity is introduced into her.</span>” Ibid., 67. Silverman never explains what kind of subjectivity this might be.</p>

        <p>88. Ibid., 39.</p>
        <p>89. This is something I am sure Silverman does not mean to suggest. Indeed, she concurs entirely with Bellour’s tracing of the relayed gaze via Sean Connery’s character to Hitchcock and back to the spectator in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marnie</em>as a typical, if flamboyant, process of phallic identification. Ibid., 203–4. See Bellour’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Hitchcock, the Enunciator.</span>”</p>
        <p>90. Silverman,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Mirror</em>,24. Silverman stakes her claim that Hollywood “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">plays more than a reproductive role in the construction of sexual difference</span>” on what she calls the increasing “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">specularization of woman</span>” coincident with its appearance in the history of Western forms of representation. She notes a concomitant “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">despecularization</span>” of the male. How this theory fits with obvious fetishizations of the male body in films, she does not elaborate.</p>
        <p>91. As remarked earlier, the uncanny can be read as an experience of paradox. If the male subject recognizes himself in female sexuality, we may, along with Silverman, claim that this is a recognition of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">woman’s otherness . . . [that] impinges dangerously upon male subjectivity.</span>” We may, however, also see this as a sign of the ambiguous basis of sexual difference, and as an experience in which difference is sustained as itself. Freud’s insistence that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">unheimlich</span>”  <em>simultaneously</em>renders the familiar and the strange suggests a (subliminal) recognition on the part of the subject that difference is what he or she  <em>is</em>.Ibid., 17.</p>
        <p>92. Ibid., 39.</p>
        <p>93. Silverman notes, too, that  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Peeping Tom</em>is aberrant within the classical system, unpleasurable in many ways. Her reading of the film, which looks only to ways in which the film structures masculine subjectivity, is only half the story. She hints that the female spectator is someone in conflict, struggling to understand herself via this ricochet of violent male desire, positing the character of Helen as a model for this condition (as well as, intriguingly, a mirror of Silverman’s own position as theorist). Ibid., 41.</p>
        <p>94. Even as she implies this discursive divide, Silverman does not want to entirely forsake the possibility that the female voice-off offers  <em>special</em>resistance to the image—that through it particularly the woman can be heard or addressed. Though she criticizes Irigaray’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">essentialism,</span>” she celebrates ways in which the voice as such contributes to the collapse of limits and boundaries in feminist films, echoing Irigaray’s vocabulary of blurred inner and outer spaces, fluidity, permeability, multiplicity within the self. Ibid., 183.</p>

        <p>98. Silverman,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Mirror</em>,166–67.</p>
        <p>99. Silverman’s notion of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">disembodiment,</span>” it should be noted, relies heavily on Doane’s article, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Voice in the Cinema.</span>” Doane’s definition of the disembodied voice is of a voice-over, as in those voices never “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">placed</span>” relative to a body, as is often used in conventional documentaries. Such a voice, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">radically other,</span>” outside space and time, and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">beyond criticism . . . censors the questions ‘Who is speaking?’ ‘Where?’ ‘In what time?’ and ‘For whom?’</span>” Doane points out that the model on which she bases these observations of the properties of the disembodied voice is more or less  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">male</em>.Doane, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Voice in the Cinema,</span>” 42.</p>
        <p>100. Silverman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Disembodying,</span>” 137.</p>
        <p>101. At the limit, she seems to share Peter Gidal’s suspicion of the image, and to hold that the image itself always renders Woman a fetishized other. See Gidal, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Against Sexual Representation.</span>”</p>
        <p>102. Were it so obviously taking place, the textual placement of the female spectator in a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">narcissistic</span>” position seems arguably a positive mechanism, given that her placement at all has by no means been established by Silverman as even having this definable characteristic in Hollywood cinema, since all texts ultimately “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">recover</span>” the female body. The use of the word narcissistic here is clearly moral, not psychoanalytic. (Silverman’s take on narcissism in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>,it should be noted, is much less puritanical than it is in this earlier essay.)</p>
        <p>103. Silverman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Disembodying,</span>” 136. Emphasis in the original. Silverman also notes here that Lisa’s narration is not only “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">at every point anchored to a specific female body, but the temporal interval which separates it from that body constantly diminishes as the film unfolds</span>” (Ibid., 136). She does not explain how she understands this notion of diminishing temporal interval; if my guess is correct, she means to imply that Lisa’s voice comes closer to being “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">over</span>” her own image as it produces the letter (her torso slumping over the candles at the end, for instance) rather than exclusively over the image of Stefan at his desk at the end of the film. Again, the stress laid on the problem of Lisa’s body, which is obviously an important one to address in this film, centers on a highlighting of the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">specific</span>” female body as the one for feminists to work past, in some sense, as if a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">non-specific</span>” female body, as described in the avantgarde films that she discusses, somehow skirts the objectionable processes of fetishization and occultation. Indeed, though the specific/non-specific (or multiple) dichotomy she sets up is interesting, the way she describes the voice relative to image in these avant-garde films tends to displace the problem of the voice as such onto the visual, to reduce it to its narrative function, its status as language, and to assume that in distance from synchronization resides an “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">essential</span>” resistance to the patriarchal use of the female body.</p>
        <p>104. He may be said, in a sense, to overhear  <em>telepathically</em>,through a sympathy the voice-off establishes between the two characters. In  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Walked with a Zombie</em>,similarly, Frances Dee’s voice-off is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">overheard</span>” by Tom Conway in just this way. Conway interrupts her voice-off reverie of delight as she stands looking at the sea to insist that the ocean (and the world) are not as beautiful as she thinks. His ability to “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">hear</span>” her thoughts presages their empathetic liaison later in the film.</p>

Although Studlar explicitly criticizes theoretical work that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">‘psychoanalyz(es)’ characters,</span>” the bulk of this essay is, in fact, dedicated to proving how well Lisa fits this particular psychoanalytic model. Studlar aims in this to upset the doxa that holds masochism as a purely passive and painful position, demonstrating how it may be understood as representing active and pleasurable subjectivity.

As Amy Lawrence suggests relative to a similarly vortexical flashback structure in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sorry, Wrong Number</em>,“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">dissolves . . . imp[ly] the  <em>connection between spaces</em>rather than the distance that separates . . .</span>” Lawrence,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,139. Emphasis added.</p>
        <p>121. Even the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">offscreen</span>” voices-off of Stefan and little Stefan work in this direction—as when they both repeat the ominous words, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Two weeks . . . !</span>” These voices cut a swath through the narrative’s progression, echoing each other.</p>
        <p>122. Branigan mentions that the courtyard scene “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">contains a future tense.</span>” Branigan,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative Comprehension</em>,189. The fact that the view of Stefan’s hands, a literal “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</span>” of Lisa’s desire, takes place while she is daydreaming, points to the representation of the shot as her fantasy. Significantly, Lisa’s fantasy is creative of the film itself and seems only marginally masochistic (if wishing to sit at someone’s feet in a wash of music is the wish of a masochist). At the very least, we see here a staging of her desire that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">comes true</span>” (however briefly) and of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the making visible, present, of what isn’t there, of what can never  <em>directly</em>be seen</span>” (Cowie, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Fantasia,</span>” 75; emphasis in the original). Is the representation of Lisa’s fantasied glimpse of where she will be (without seeing it when she is there) a way of figuring female desire?</p>

        <p>124. Ibid., 191.</p>
        <p>125. Jacqueline Rose discusses the problem of the visible and points out Lacan’s interest in exposing the farce of the value “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">accrued</span>” to the visible. She seems at a loss, however, to explain how or if Lacan suggests a means for the female to be conceptualized beyond the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">masquerade</span>” she figures, and suggests that Lacan’s theory of value, like Levi-Strauss’s, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">presupposes the subordination which it is intended to explain.</span>”  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Feminine Sexuality</em>,42–45.</p>
        <p>126. Perhaps one of the most important points of Vasse’s work regards the relation between the voice and writing—both, in his view, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">always betray something of the unconscious.</span>” Vasse,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’ombilic</em>,8.

        <p>128. Other psychoanalytic texts, obviously, can also be scrutinized in this regard—not only original works by Lacan and Freud that Vasse and Rosolato interpolate, but theories offered by feminists like Irigaray and Kristeva. Interestingly, Slavoj Zˇizˇek has recently reinterpreted Chion’s notion of the  <em>acousmatique</em>itself, and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">used</span>” it to figure the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">object voice.</span>” See Restivo, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Recent Approaches</span>” 137–39.</p>

This opposition of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">savoir</span>” and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">lieu</span>” is a crucial element of Vasse’s theory of the voice. He later declares that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the unconscious is the instance of place (lieu) and the conscious is that of knowledge (savoir).</span>” The unconscious has “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">something to do with the body and the question of its origin in the place . . . the conscious . . . elaborates a system of abstract representations, separated, outside the place, articulated in  <em>time</em>. . . and  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">is the consequence, outside the place, of what goes on there</em>.</span>” The voice, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">between</span>” these two, founds them and is constituted of them. It speaks of an impossible heterogeneity, what can be “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">said</span>” and what “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">is</span>” speaking (ça parle).

        <p>138. Italics indicate emphasis in the original; underlining indicates added emphasis.

Lacan,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Four Fundamental</em>,258.</p>
        <p>139. Lawrence’s reading of Rosolato corroborates this conclusion. She affirms, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The ‘feminine’ quality of the maternal voice . . . is one of the aspects projected onto it at a later stage,  <em>after</em>the recognition of difference.</span>” Lawrence,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,27. Emphasis in the original.</p>
        <p>140. Music, he also reminds, in “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">its archaic forms [has] . . . a rapport with . . . religious themes of sacrifice.</span>” These connections may explain the powerful alignment of female voice-off and music in melodrama. Rosolato,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Essais sur le symbolique</em>,296. My translation.</p>
        <p>141. Turk further claims that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">music, as contrasted with language, may remain a ‘good’ acoustic object.</span>” He goes on to argue that the films of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, where “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">song assume[s] primacy over dialogue . . . intimate notions of subjectivity that confound mainstream assumptions concerning sexual difference. [Their acoustic and textual operations] promote extraordinary eruptions of freely circulating, virtually  <em>decorporealized</em>libido.</span>” Turk, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Deriding the Voice,</span>” 104, 109, 111. Emphasis added.</p>
        <p>142. What Silverman terms Stefan’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">willingness to read</span>” should rather be described as a state of acoustic receptiveness, a suspension of limits that allow her voice to permeate, to fascinate, to be heard “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">in</span>” the words he reads. Silverman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Disembodied,</span>” 136.</p>
        <p>143. The recognizability of the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">star-voice</span>” clearly comes into play here. Whereas contemporary audiences may or may not have recognized Fontaine “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">in</span>” her voice here, within the  <em>story</em>,she has not been revealed visually and remains anonymous. Certainly today’s audience would recognize most of the famous voices in these films before seeing the actresses’ faces. Here Hollywood capitalizes in an obvious way on star “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">visibility</span>” even as that star is not visible. If the star’s  <em>body</em>is thereby perceived, that body still emerges in vocal form and is subject to the same plurality in/of space described earlier. This multiplicity may be even aggravated—as the character is also “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">someone else,</span>” the voice is also “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">someone else’s</span>”—a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">star’s.</span>”</p>
        <p>144. The voice-off’s implied awareness of what is going on in the image leads me to disagree with White that Lisa “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">is not privileged to witness the images her narrative induces.</span>” On the contrary, Lisa’s voice-off seems to lovingly resurrect these images, her story, for Stefan, and to “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">watch</span>” them with him in their sharing of an imaginary past.

Fischer sees the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">intricacy</span>” of  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter</em>’s structure as symbolic of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">psychic entrapment.</span>” She adds that the stasis in the film is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">counterpoint[ed]</span>” . . . by Ophüls’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">formal reliance on camera movement.</span>” Thus, even on the image track, a work of contradiction is fundamental here.

        <p>5. Nick Browne detaches of the notion of point of view from literal camera placement and prioritizes the rhetoric of narrativization. He sets out the possibility for a description of point of view that does not necessarily “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">belong</span>” to a character per se, but rather reflects the spectator’s grasp of perspective in an abstract sense. His model suggests, then, a means for theorizing the (simultaneously) “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">multiple</span>” point of view I allude to above.

        <p>14. Kozloff,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Invisible Storytellers</em>,11. The debate continues on whether sound is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">equal</span>” to image. Branigan suggests that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">[o]f the many false statements about sound offered by theorists, perhaps the most misleading is to say that sound and image have an equal status in film.</span>”  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative Comprehension</em>,267. Overall, blanket demotions of either image or sound relative to the Other seem a dead end for film studies. There are films (like those of Brakhage) that work toward “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">pure</span>” visuality, and others obsessed with “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">pure</span>” sound (Straub/Huillet and some of Duras’s films). Many silent experimental directors, of course, expressly tried to “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">evoke</span>” sound through image in films like  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Symphonie Diagonale</em>and  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rhythmus II</em>.</p>
        <p>15. Lawrence has made a similar connection in her analysis of several films from the 1940s, within which she sees a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">textual association of man with the image and woman with sound [that] accentuates the way cultural values associated with gender are assigned to cinema’s image/sound hierarchy.</span>” Lawrence,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,112.</p>
        <p>16. Arnheim, who views sound as a demon-seed come to pollute, disable, and destroy the plastic integrity of the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">silent</span>” film, notes that speech “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">interferes with the expression of the image,</span>” and impoverishes this “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">pure</span>” art form, turning it into “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">an unstable hybrid.</span>” Arnheim, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Laocoön,</span>” 114–15. 17.

        <p>29. This “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">prologue</span>” was a sore point of contention between director Lang and the studio bigwigs at Universal-International, who felt it was both “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">too long</span>” and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">foolish, semi-Freudian, unrevealing nonsense.</span>” Their initial recut of the entire opening of the film to drop the prologue, the death of Celia’s brother, and her trip to Mexico/honeymoon with Mark brought Lang’s relationship with producer Walter Wanger to a crisis point.

        <p>43. Ibid., 50. Bergstrom has critiqued Burch and Dana’s generalization in respect to the reformulation of codes she observes at work in Lang’s film, noting the many reversals, doublings, and repetitions that complicate the film’s structure, mise-en-scene, and significations. Bergstrom, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Logic of Fascination,</span>” III, 1–28.</p>
        <p>44. Burch and Dana expressly point to the elaborate camera movement that links the two Hacienda scenes: in the first scene it “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">stands out</span>” as excessive, in the second it makes “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">everything fall into place, . . .</span>” “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">tie[s] the final knot</span>” back to linearity. But this camera movement also re-inscribes the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">excess</span>” of the prologue’s tracking movement, as well as those in the wedding scenes— and serves thus to collapse time, suggesting that all four movements could be taking place simultaneously, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">in</span>” Celia’s mind as she swings on the hammock, wondering (and wandering) in her mind about the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">stranger</span>” in her arms.

        <p>47. This scene bears striking similarities to Lisa’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">staging</span>” of the longdesired encounter with Stefan in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>.Lisa, too, wants to meet Stefan “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">on her own ground</span>”—and she traps him, so to speak, in the scenario she knows he cannot resist. But in the case of Lisa (as opposed to the  <em>other</em>women he thinks  <em>he</em>traps), she is fully in control of this seduction, setting herself out to be seduced. In this sense, Lisa’s ultimate entrée into Stefan’s apartments does not seem the ruthlessly depressing scenario it has been painted by many critics. Where once she was a powerless, wretched voyeur on the stairs, unable to enact her desire, she now is participating in life and its risks. That we see her from the stairs underscores the fact that she knows the risks, and  <em>we know she knows how she looks from there</em>.</p>
        <p>48. Bergstrom has noted the confluence of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">doubling</span>” between Celia and Mark throughout this film, a thematic she links obliquely to Lang’s Expressionist roots. Bergstrom, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Logic of Fascination,</span>” III, 21–23.</p>
        <p>49. The symbolic workings of their speeches here are rich in suggesting a shared romantic fatalism, a fairy-tale view of love that waits for the One (“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Sleeping Beauty</span>” and her prince) as well as a (perhaps equally romantic— and Freudian) sadomasochistic configuration of sexual passion (Celia’s and Mark’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">real feelings</span>” awakened by the sight of blood).</p>
        <p>50. These remarks are partially inspired by the work of Poizat on the functioning of silence in opera. Poizat, leaning heavily on Lacan, defines a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">voixpure</span>” as a voice that is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">heard</span>” apart from speech, a voice heard for itself. In this respect, we can associate the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">voix-pure</span>” with silence (as well, tangentially, with music). Poizat states,“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">[a] paradox appears perhaps to be in effect lifted when we envision the question of silence not in its opposition to sound, but in its opposition to speech.</span>” He goes on to associate silence closely with “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the cry</span>” (another form of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">voix pure</span>” in that it renders the sense-giving aspect of the voice unintelligible, incidental). Poizat,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Opéra</em>,130. My translation. In the continuum he draws (silence and the cry on one side, speech and meaning on the other—with song mediating between), I would place female voice-off close to  <em>song</em>—for its musicality, its poetry, its dynamic relation to silence and its corporeality. As Barthes notes, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">we rarely listen to a voice  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">en soi</em>,in itself, we listen to what it says.</span>” In some sense, then, perhaps Celia is really listening to Mark’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">voix pure.</span>” Barthes,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Grain of the Voice</em>,183.</p>
        <p>51. Poizat,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Opéra</em>,124. As Poizat interprets Lacan, the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">objet-voix is not an . . . object . . . [but] . . . a process inherent to each individual, a process by which the voice constitutes itself as object, as drive, and as an object which is marked as lost . . .</span>” Poizat,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Opéra</em>,142. My translation.</p>
        <p>52. Branigan’s position, that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">. . . in a [deep] . . . sense, a character’s glance is an important measure of the  <em>acquisition of knowledge</em>by character and spectator,</span>” seems admirably demonstrated in this scene. Branigan,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative Comprehension</em>,53. Emphasis in the original.</p>
        <p>53. Waldman has argued that the gothic structure of the mansion in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret</em>is a metaphor for the domestic isolation of the woman in the home. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Architectural Metaphor,</span>” 55–69.</p>
        <p>54. Doane’s brief comments on this scene merit note. Describing the voiceoff here as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">convey[ing] her [Celia’s] thoughts . . . [to] herself,</span>” she describes the shot (somewhat inaccurately, as she states that the image of the door  <em>follows</em>Celia’s words, when the words actually  <em>coincide</em>with the image) as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">ruptur[ing] the spatial continuity of the scene . . . appear[ing] from nowhere. . . . [T]he markers of subjectivity or interiority (a dissolve, extreme close-up concentrating on the eyes, loss of focus) are absent. . . . Because [the door] is not present in the space occupied by Celia, it could not be the object of a point-of-view structure.</span>” Doane,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Desire to Desire</em>,138. It is curious that Doane does not consider the voice-off a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">marker of subjectivity</span>” (especially, as she notes its representation of Celia’s internal thoughts a moment earlier). Doane’s reading of point of view here relies entirely on the image, discounting sound and voice. Moreover, her comments imply a strict association of point of view with immediate diegetic space.</p>
        <p>55. Doane has suggested that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the central concern of [Celia’s] investigation is the discovery of what her husband . . . keeps behind the locked door labeled 7.</span>” Only a secondary concern is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">analyzing her relation with Mark.</span>” Surely, if this were true, the film’s  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">raison d’être</em>would be fulfilled with the opening of the door, and the narrative would have nothing left to resolve (for a still lengthy chunk of time). Doane,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Desire to Desire</em>,150.</p>
        <p>56. Doane views the moment of unlocking the door, and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">[confronting] . . . an aspect of herself,</span>” as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">a process of doubling or repetition [that] lock[s] the woman within a narcissistic construct.</span>” Doane,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Desire to Desire</em>,137. The notion that self knowledge equals narcissism is a perplexing one, as is the implication that narcissism is by definition a negative attribute for the female character in “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">locking</span>” her (to herself?).</p>
        <p>57. Ibid., 151. Doane’s statement here is debatable, as Celia’s voice-off does pick back up later in the film, following Mark’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">interruption,</span>” albeit in a transformed modality, as I shall discuss.</p>

He suggests that because song can be construed as a heightening of the scream’s erotic dimension (desire), the high-pitched female voice has a particularly charged paradoxical affect. He claims, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the soprano is the manifest sign of . . . power . . . in a libidinal transaction that . . . embraces the feminine . . . [and] takes male subjectivity  <em>to be dependent upon it and incomplete without it . . </em>.</span>” Turk, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Deriding the Voice,</span>” 112–13.

Setting himself up in competition with Hitchcock, moreover, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Lang claimed that with  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret Beyond the Door</em>he was interested in the  <em>mood of a fictional space</em>,</span>” comparing the project to  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em>.Bernstein,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Walter Wanger</em>,209, 215.

[in which] the institution of marriage is haunted by murder.</span>” Doane goes on to describe Celia’s voice-off as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">surprised</span>” at realizing she is marrying a stranger. Celia’s intonation, in fact, is rather one of fatalism— cognizant of danger, but also excited. The point is not that she is worried about “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">an overly hasty marriage,</span>” as Doane suggests, but that her desire is, specifically, to unite with this man she does not know, so that in learning who he is (since he is her desire) she may know herself.

The ending of Mankiewicz’s  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Honeypot</em>also bears a zany inflection of this technique.</p>

Branigan has noted how misleading the term “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">point of view</span>” is in general in that it “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">suggests that there is a single principle (a ‘point’) that accounts for the unity of a perceptual judgment (a ‘view’), rather than a series of relationships spanning a range of mental activities.</span>” Branigan,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative Comprehension</em>,255.</p>
        <p>73. Kozloff suggests this may be an effect of any voice-over narrator, even those with a much shorter lifespan than Celia’s. My sense is that such voices may initiate or elaborate a point of view, as I’ve described here, without even really functioning as a  <em>narrating</em>presence in the film over all. Kozloff,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Invisible Storytellers</em>,4.</p>

        <p>75.  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Walked with a Zombie</em>,another oft-cited film with multiple voices-off, differs in interesting ways from both  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret</em>and  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eve</em>,in that the main female voice-off “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">shares</span>” the voice-off not with another character but with a completely non-localizable “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">voice-of-God</span>” that emerges only in the last moments of the film, speaking with a Haitian accent, quoting a dark bit of Scripture. The nurse’s voice-off may ultimately still be read as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">sharing</span>” this final voiceoff— for her character has evolved to ever higher levels of identification with the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">space</span>” from which this voice-of-God is delivered—that of the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">natives,</span>” and that of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">religion/superstition.</span>”</p>

        <p>77. Ibid., 68–69. Kozloff also suggests that Addison’s power is compromised at the end, when “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the image maker</span>” has the last word and shows us the other side of Eve’s triumph. Kozloff,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Invisible Storytellers</em>,70–71.</p>
        <p>78. Ibid., 68.</p>
        <p>79. Since the studio (Twentieth Century Fox) went over Mankiewicz’s head to cut out the voices of women, however, there certainly could be a strong argument for an ideological agenda taking place subliminally here, in the doctoring of the film to reassert the male voice-off’s primacy. Ibid., 68.</p>
        <p>80. Ibid., 66–67. The question of what Barthes calls the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">grain</span>” of the voice, its definition, has found myriad interpretations in film studies. Pamela Robertson, for example, considers the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">ironic</span>” tone of male voice-over in noir films a manifestation of grain. I see the irony (or sincerity) as a function of performance and script (or even point of view), rather than as an attribute of the voice per se. The grain referred to here is in the thickening of Addison’s voice when he first pronounces the name “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Eve,</span>” the texture of desire infecting his voice, so to speak, physically. Robertson, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Structural Irony,</span>” 45.</p>
        <p>81. Although Eve never possesses a voice-off in the film, she nonetheless bears a marked preference for offscreen space. She frequently speaks from offscreen, as she does here, hovers offscreen, invisible to others who do not know she is watching (as when she interrupts Margo and Bill’s good-by kiss at the airport), always seems just outside the frame, knowing more about others than is known about her (in this sense, perhaps, like Addison, she is outside the story).</p>
        <p>82. Girard,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Deceit, Desire</em>,1–52, 83–95.</p>
        <p>83. Doubtless the female subject here seems defined in terms of narcissism, but so is the male subject (Addison desires himself through Eve, that is, to be that powerful critic she worships). Girard’s whole theory really rests on the premise that all desire is narcissism mediated through others who appear to have accessed a narcissistic wholeness without difficulty. Despite its pessimism, his model is of interest for feminism, as it defines desire as metaphysical, sidestepping the thorny dichotomies of sexual difference.</p>
        <p>84. Pamela Robertson calls female voice-overs “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">earnest</span>”—“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">unlike typical male narrations [they are] almost never ironic.</span>” Robertson, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Structural Irony,</span>” 44–45.</p>
        <p>85. Barthes continues: “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">In fact, it suffices that the cinema capture the sound of speech  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">close up</em>. . . to succeed in shifting the signified a great distance and in throwing, so to speak, the anonymous body of the actor into my ear . . .</span>” Barthes,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pleasure of the Text</em>,66–67.

        <p>23. Ibid., 51. In discussing the male “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">voice-over</span>” (a category she borrows from Doane), Silverman not only notes its rarity but also states that when it does appear, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">it is usually associated with a diegetic figure.</span>” Ibid. She seems to be saying in fact that it is not a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">disembodied voice-over</span>” at all, but (in her terminology) an  <em>embodied</em>voice-over. Moreover, one of the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">disembodied</span>” voice-over examples she gives, the voice that opens  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Johnny Belinda</em>(1948) is the voice of a diegeticized male character, the rapist. If one were to go fishing for examples of male voice-off “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">embodiment</span>” that lead to narrative containment, this voice provides ample fodder—his voice-off mis-leads us at the outset, suggesting he has some distance on the story about to unfold, then disappears “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">into</span>” an unlikable character who exemplifies the abuse of power, until, finally, he is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">silenced</span>” altogether by the mute female lead, who shoots him. Silverman reads this film in terms that portray the woman’s objectification and impotence. However, this film may also be viewed as a good example of discursive contradiction, wherein the voice of male oppression is read as such. For Silverman’s discussion of the film, see  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Mirror</em>,67–70.</p>

        <p>29. Doane is, of course, critical of the ideological burden of this “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">directness</span>” (expressive of patriarchal authority). Interestingly, she notes later that, in trying to countervail this burden, many documentary filmmakers have eschewed the voice-over. Doane suggests that the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">silencing</span>” of the voice of authority, however, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">promotes . . . an illusion that reality speaks and is not spoken, that the film is not a constructed discourse.</span>” One can only feel somewhat sympathetic towards documentarists, who apparently just cannot win, one way or the other.

        <p>33. This central scene also provides a contradictory “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">key</span>” that renders the ending of the film unstable. For, though we have “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">seen</span>” that Nancy was subjected to a brutal experience as a child, we also see that the trauma arises at  <em>not being believed</em>.In important ways, Nancy is a victim of male paranoia in this film, a persecution that she finally internalizes and claims as a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">true</span>” selfimage.</p>
        <p>34. Ibid., 54.

        <p>56. Ibid., 93. In suggesting that discourse, to be invulnerable to such “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">usurpation,</span>” needs to be “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">ec-centric</span>” to the narrative structure, Suter aligns herself implicitly with a logic that, again, sees discursive subjectivity as a position of exterior authority.</p>
        <p>57. Ibid., 101. The sequence Suter points to as enunciating the character Cynthia’s desire involves Cynthia’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">voice-off</span>” (speaking post-coitus from offscreen space) while her body and that of her lover remain offscreen. Suter suggests the offscreen evocation of desire “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">elide[s] all explicit signifiers of sexuality.</span>” Cynthia’s voice-off, to the contrary, strongly suggests her subjectivity and desire, invoking our perception of erotic bodies in space, rapt in their own pleasure and inaccessible to our gaze. A more sustained analysis of the workings of voice and sound in the film might bolster the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">strength</span>” of the feminine discourse that Suter considers excessively frail in her account. Ibid., 97.</p>

Emphasis added.</p>
        <p>61. Indeed,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blackmail</em>could be said (if one wanted to construct hierarchies between sound and image) to favor sound over image—sound, moreover, that structures subjectivity in terms of the female character rather than the male. Consider, for instance, the famous scene in which the character Alice’s inner thoughts are a torment of subjectivistic sound—the increasingly loud and rapid repetitions of the word “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">knife</span>” uttered by her gossipy neighbor. This is a fascinating moment of voice-off, illustrating its rhetorical and psychic heterogeneity well, for this voice-off can be read not only as the offscreen sound of the neighbor speaking, but also as the main character’s inner thoughts as well. Amy Lawrence, in a compelling analysis that stresses the discursive contradiction at work here, describes Alice’s painfully experienced struggle to speak as self-consciously underscored by the film. In  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blackmail</em>,she argues, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">patriarchal culture is indicted with the exposure of its intentional suppression of the woman’s voice.</span>” Lawrence,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,116.</p>

        <p>64. Silverman, who is extremely critical of Bellour’s nostalgic auteurism and his obvious identification with Hitchcock et al., via the relaying gaze, ultimately agrees with him on this sweeping view of classical cinema. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">[H]e is correct in assuming that the authorial system of most Hollywood films forecloses upon the female voice. If we were to ask . . . where [this discourse] come[s] from . . . the answer would resoundingly be: ‘The male subject.’</span>” Silverman,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Mirror</em>,205.</p>

        <p>73. The invocation of the notion of a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">direct</span>” relationship to the viewer established by the voice-off here obviously differs from Silverman’s outlined earlier. In my view, such “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">directness</span>” implies a discursive relationship in which the voice-off is not merely “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">heard</span>” by a viewer (intrusive or otherwise), but rather is understood to have enounced words/speech  <em>in order to be heard</em>.In those cases where voice-off represents thought, rather than speech, this schema is also at odds with Doane’s, in that within it such moments may in fact mark the most “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">direct</span>” relationship between viewer and voice-off. The viewer understands these thoughts to be those of a consciousness that speaks, as it were, telepathically, thus bringing about a deeper complicity than is possible with the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">authoritative</span>” voice-over.</p>
        <p>74. This “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">speaking to</span>” stance parallels, on the image track, those moments when a character looks directly in the camera. However, such analogies have their limitations, given that the spectator’s metapsychological relationship to the voice differs markedly from that which he or she takes up via the gaze.</p>
        <p>75. Male voice-off also works this way, perforce the direct and self-imbricating stance of the narrator. However, the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">subjective</span>” overlay that is so common to the female voice-off (in its association not only to an especially complicit direct address and to an effect of shared consciousness between the character and viewer) foregrounds a specifically feminine discourse. She not only “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">speaks,</span>” but “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">speaks to</span>” the spectator with a candor and vulnerability unthinkable, for example, for the noir voices-off of  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Out of the Past, Dark Passage</em>,and  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Murder My Sweet</em>.The female voice-off, that is, implies  <em>it knows</em>it speaks to/for women.</p>
        <p>76. Gene Tierney’s reluctance and failure to marry again in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ghost and Mrs. Muir</em>similarly reflects this feminine desire to possess a home in her own right.</p>
        <p>77. Stanwyck’s carefully modulated lyricism here, and the subtly orchestrated mix of her voice’s syncopated rhythms and tones with the musical score, strongly reminds of Fontaine’s voice-off in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>and  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em>,as well as the voices-off in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret Beyond the Door, All about Eve</em>,and  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Brief Encounter</em>.In fact, the female voice-off is almost invariably “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">musical</span>”—the greatest exception being Crawford’s voice-off in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildred Pierce</em>.This exception seems due to the effort to employ this voice-off as a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</span>” narrator, an attempt that backfires, given the prototypical vulnerability of her address (as opposed to male voice-off irony). See Robertson, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Structural Irony.</span>”</p>
        <p>78. Renov points out this slippage in Claire Trevor’s voice-off, noting how her voice “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">at moments provid[es] expository overlay but more often produc[es] a commentary of emotional response.</span>” Renov, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no"> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal:</em>The Woman,</span>” 20.</p>

        <p>82. Girard has noted how envy and jealousy are dead giveaways of desire: the jealous wife in “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">hating</span>” Addie betrays her true feeling of admiration (and vice versa). Girard insists that to understand such a desire as (merely) homosexual is to miss the point. Rather, the desire for the object (Brad) is an illusion, an erotic value conferred because of a passionate attachment to the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">fascinating rival.</span>” All desire (and  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>certainly seems a tribute to this theory), Girard suggests, is triangular.  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Deceit, Desire</em>,46–51.</p>
        <p>83. Hollinger describes the film’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">narrational perspective</span>” as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">extremely confused.</span>” Hollinger sees Addie’s narration as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">casting an ironic light on the wives</span>” when they renew their dedication to their marriages. She shows Addie’s power to reside in the contempt she holds for the women’s concessions to marriage, but fails to account for the patriarchal discourse Addie delivers along with her enunciation of power, independence, and female beauty. Hollinger, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Listening to the Female,</span>” 41–43.</p>
        <p>84. These are Silverman’s words, turned to counter her own argument, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">against</span>” classical cinema. She writes here about  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gold Diggers</em>,a feminist film, but her description fits Addie’s discursive reversibility to a T. Silverman,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Acoustic Mirror</em>,180.</p>
        <p>85. Ibid., 180.</p>
        <p>86. Deborah’s insecurity also stems from the difficulty of reinserting herself into a feminine role after life in the military. Her difficulty playing the  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">femme</em>was apparently shared by scores of WACS, WAVES, and the like. See Campbell, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Regimented Women.</span>”</p>
        <p>87. At this moment, Addie’s voice operates somewhat like the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">auditory master</span>” that Silverman implies the spectator is, relative to interior monologue (but, of course, here the voice is the intruder, not the spectator). (Her voice reminds also of Fritz Lang’s experimental “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">thought-voice</span>” discussed in chapter 2.)</p>
        <p>88. They can only communicate via the voice. One could think of the flashbacks that arise in relation to the voice as responding to this idea, as if the women are trying to defend themselves to their husbands telepathically. Their “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">speech</span>” (enounced by the flashbacks) is underlined by the image of the telephone as a form of possible resistance to Addie’s own speech. Speech is thus, again, emphasized by this film as a power relation.</p>
        <p>89. Ideologically speaking, of course, this description fits, with uncanny precision, the movie we are watching. One can only wonder exactly how radical Joseph Mankiewicz’s politics really were! But, again, the patriarchal speaks along with the feminine here: “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">It’s a joke.</span>” (Or is it?) Both and neither are true, finally.</p>
        <p>90. Female voices-off function as hallucinations much more frequently than do male voices-off. Often these voices-off are unpleasant memories (like Joan Fontaine’s nightmare in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em>,when her brutal patroness’s words, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">They say he simply adored her,</span>” ring in her head). At other times, the voice is that of the woman herself, such as in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Two Mrs. Carrolls</em>.Stanwyck’s character shouts at her own voice-off, which rises out of her head to torment her, as she tries to reject the voice-off’s suggestion that her husband is going to kill her.</p>
        <p>91. This unusual moment coincides with what Heath describes as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">subjectivity  <em>in the image</em></span>” that differs from the more common relaying of a character’s “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">point of view</span>” via an overlay of first- and third-person modes. This shot comes across, that is, as  <em>explicitly</em>first-person—entirely non-objective. Heath, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative Space,</span>” 47–48. Emphasis in the original.</p>
        <p>92. Doane,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Desire to Desire</em>,147–48.</p>
        <p>93. This is the first of three “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">presents</span>” Addie sends the men, fetish-gifts that are calculated to represent her in her absence as the paragon they imagine, according to the specifications of their desire. For Brad, a snob—champagne; for George, a more likable snob—classical music; for Hollingsway, a would-be bourgeois snob—a portrait of Addie in a silver frame. Significantly, however, this first present is  <em>also</em>for Deborah, Addie’s favorite torture subject. Deborah, we will see, is Addie’s pet project, in her role as patriarchal missionary.</p>
        <p>94. Rita’s real “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">crime,</span>” of course, is writing for the radio and making more money than George, who teaches drama. The script’s obsession with the poisonous infiltration of popular culture thus neatly meshes with a classic sexrole reversal that is also timely in the post–World War II era. The implication that Rita feminizes George is brought up over and over, just as radio is, in a sense, represented as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">feminizing</span>” culture at large (all those soap operas!). Interestingly, Rita is shown as kowtowing to another (wo)man in her job, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Mrs. Manly</span>” (which, apparently, she must become if she keeps working, a kind of sexual hybrid). Thus we are able to applaud when she “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">stands up for herself</span>” by standing by her man, refusing to “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">take his place</span>” (become a man), by taking the time to cater to her husband.</p>
        <p>95. Addie’s husband, it is said, left her. That is why she wants/needs one of theirs. Addie’s lack of a husband makes her dangerous—and desirable—not only to the men, however, for all the women’s stories imply their longing to be independent (as Addie seems to be).</p>
        <p>96. Lawrence has described the public agitation fomented by the emergence of women announcers during the dawn of radio. She claims, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">[T]he  <em>speaking</em>woman puts herself in a position of authority—a definite breach of propriety.</span>” This controversy, she adds, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">. . . would never in effect be resolved in . . . [the] sound film.</span>”  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,18. Emphasis in the original.</p>
        <p>97. When Rita does behave like a stereotypical female, breaking down into tears, she handles George nicely. He stops complaining and supports her. The patriarchal discourse here encourages her to take her power the womanly way, a way that (mis)represents her as weak.</p>
        <p>98. Altman, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Moving Lips,</span>” 71, 73. Bresson is quoted from Burch,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Theory of Film Practice</em>,90.</p>
        <p>99. The classic pairing of voice-off to a close-up here suggests both that the voice is an “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">interior monologue</span>” or a hallucination. In fact, as it is wont, the voice-off drifts from one “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">status</span>” into another as the scene progresses, becoming more and more “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">external</span>” to Lora Mae, vised, however, through her subjective perception. Thus, it represents both “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">types</span>” of voices-off.</p>
        <p>100. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Audio spectacle,</span>” as this moment might well be described, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">guides us away from ‘content’ (language, character psychology, exposition) and toward the quality of the sound, irrespective of whether music, voices, or effects are on the sound track.</span>” Lawrence,  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Echo and Narcissus</em>,96.</p>
        <p>101. Williams, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Is Sound Recording,</span>” 51–66.</p>
        <p>102. Excess is in the air here, in the image of the bursting pipe and the sound of an “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">alien</span>” voice urging her to doubt her indifference to her marriage. It is an excess both patriarchal (she can’t “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">not care</span>” about losing her husband if the story is to continue) and self-reflexive (she recognizes that “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">man behind the curtain</span>”).</p>
        <p>103. The power of Addie’s lure is brought home by Hollingsway’s fixation on the portrait; he cannot seem to stop staring at it. Lora Mae finally disrupts this obsessive gaze by kissing him forcefully, reminding him of her body. After the kiss, Addie’s portrait is conspicuously framed  <em>out</em>of the very wide, final shot of the room when Lora Mae leaves, leaving Hollingsway to now stare befuddled after  <em>her</em>.</p>
        <p>104. One could argue in this sense that Lora Mae understands what Addie “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">is</span>” better than the other women do. She agrees to “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">play</span>” Addie, knowing Addie is a construct of male desire. But Addie represents no real threat to Lora Mae, because, like Addie, Lora Mae has no illusions (yet) about being desired for herself.</p>
        <p>105. Significantly, the problem of the name is now revised—he is “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Mrs. Bishop’s husband,</span>”  <em>her</em>possession.</p>
        <p>106. In an Oedipal role-reversal here, Deborah accuses Hollingsway of not being “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">grown up,</span>” or “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">a man,</span>” spurring him on to his noble gesture of confession. Five minutes later, he restores himself to the place of the father, referring to her as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">just a kid.</span>”</p>
        <p>107. In this “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">diva</span>” mode, again, she takes up Addie’s voice. Addie, a woman adored and reviled, is a prima donna, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">ruthlessly competitive . . . extravagantly vain, and glamorously ornamental.</span>” Pope has shown how the voice of the diva in literature by women is used “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">less as [a] vehicle for seducing men than for empowering women—both [the self] and other women.</span>” As diva then, Addie has empowered Deborah finally to speak. Pope, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Diva Doesn’t Die,</span>” 139–40.</p>
        <p>108. In this sense, she reminds of Pat in  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal</em>,as Renov sees her, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">speaking for all women.</span>” Renov, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no"> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal:</em>The Woman,</span>” 20.</p>
        <p>109. Hollinger, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Listening to the Female,</span>” 43.</p>
        <p>110. Hollinger sees Addie as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">reduced to [this] ineffectual gesture,</span>” implying that the loss of Addie’s power is represented thus. Such interference with the image from beyond, on the contrary, clearly exceeds even the usual regime of knowledge and power doled out to (even male) voices-off comparable to hers. Ibid., 43.</p>
        <p>111. Ibid., 43. The spirit of Hollinger’s analysis here is unquestionably compelling. Her reading of the voice-off in this film, however, relies on a summary “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">dialog-oriented</span>” reading that neglects the problematic of sound’s relationship to the image, or to other sounds. For example, she describes the flashbacks as all triggered by Addie’s voice. As we have seen, the configuration of voiceoff in these moments is far more complex, strange, and provocative than a simple dialogic description would allow.</p>
