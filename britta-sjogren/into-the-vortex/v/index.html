        <p>What is so perilous, then, in the fact people speak, and that their speech proliferates? What is the danger in that?</p>

        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Drowning in Music: “<span>Beyond</span>” Dissonance</h3>
        <p>At the conclusion of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Humoresque</em> (1946), a melancholy John Garfield (Paul Boray), in shock at his fiancée’s sudden and tragic suicide, looks down at the city from his penthouse and reminisces to a friend how she “<span>once asked [him] what it was like to live up here—the Boray point-of-view</span>”. He continues, “<span>It’s lonely. . . . It all seemed so simple once . . . you find out it’s not that easy. Nothing comes free. One way or another, you pay for what you are</span>”. His statement is ambiguous, referring, perhaps to his “<span>paying</span>” for his involvement with a married woman, Helen—or of “<span>paying</span>” for his selfish absorption with his music at the expense of her needs. Perhaps, also, he is referring to Helen, who has “<span>paid</span>” for being pragmatic, rather than romantic, about marriage and divorce, for being a woman of ambition, for desiring more than being desired. Significantly, we are offered no “<span>point-of-view</span>” shot that might tell us something of the “<span>Boray point-ofview</span>”. Rather, Paul gazes inward, toward himself and his past, completing the spiral flashback that has returned us to the “<span>beginning</span>” of the film. His inward look also inscribes a retroactive connection to a strongly subjective point-of-view shot that Helen herself possesses in the previous scene. What is “<span>lacking</span>” from Paul’s perspective (both formally and symbolically) here is, specifically, the view that Helen provides.</p>
        <p>Drunk and tormented by the “<span>impossibility</span>” of their marriage, Helen paces her beach house, as she listens to Paul’s live musical performance from Carnegie Hall on the radio. Two voices-off suddenly emerge to counterpose with the aural dominance of Paul’s offscreen violin here—acting as “<span>voices in her head</span>”, they strongly represent Helen’s thinking consciousness, lost in morbid contemplation. One voice, that of her soon-to-bedivorced husband, gently admonishes her that neither she nor Paul will ever “<span>change</span>”, and that Paul only cares about his music. The second voiceoff (Paul’s) echoes his selfish whining on the telephone moments before, when, upset that she is not at the performance, he accuses her of trying to ruin his concert, ruin his career, ruin “<span>everything</span>”. In representing Helen’s thoughts, these voices are “<span>alien</span>”—Helen does not want to hear them. She rejects them, smashing her glass against a window, cutting the voicesoff short in the shattering sound. The internality they evoke—of Helen’s mind—displaces now onto the “<span>other</span>” voice that continues to sound in the room—Paul’s music. Indeed, the dissonance between “<span>Paul the man</span>” and “<span>Paul the musician</span>” is stressed here. Helen prefers “<span>the voice</span>” of the second, and it amplifies as she walks outside the house, subtly shifting from its status as “<span>offscreen sound</span>” emanating from a radio into a powerful aural connection between them that plays “<span>in Helen’s head</span>” but which seems supernaturally to fill the very space of the universe between and around these characters as the scene progresses.</p>
        <p>Thus the “<span>voice</span>” of his violin follows her as she wanders along the beach, swelling in ecstatic crescendos, filling the screen with his aural presence. But this is not just Paul’s “<span>voice</span>”: it is also Helen’s—her internality produces it and “<span>plays</span>” it as surely as his fingers draw the bow miles away. We hear it as they do—a sound created between their two figures, speaking for both of them. Shared in this way between them, this “<span>voice</span>” draws her to the ocean’s edge. It illustrates her passion with/as this elemental force. Massive waves pound the shore, terrifying and intimate, linked to her body through deliberate pans, tracking shots that isolate her against the water and the shimmering of light that plays off its liquid surface and her black sequined gown. Helen faces the water, and a series of reverse shots frame her face ever more closely, juxtaposed with the encroaching waves that rise in height as the violin reaches a fever pitch. She moves toward the water/camera, blurring out of focus. In the final, eerie “<span>point-ofview</span>” shot, taken as she “<span>goes under</span>”, the ocean waves tumble “<span>over</span>” her perception, giving way to the inky depths beneath and the bubbles that tell us her breath is giving out. This point of view, excessively excessive, aligns us solidly with Helen in her last moments, as it aligns her with Paul, whose rendition of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tristan and Isolde</em> follows (or leads) her to her grave. But it also shows that she sees something he does not—“<span>the impossible</span>”. Rather, Helen internalizes, becomes one with an impossibility that Paul externalizes and renders perceptible. Helen’s suicidal gesture, and what she sees underwater, represent differently the emotions Paul evokes and experiences as he plays his instrument. Here music—the voice between them—expresses an interior condition that is valid for both of them, but which is performed in different ways, through different gestures, “<span>heard</span>” differently “<span>through</span>” them. This voice not only links them but articulates their difference, for it “<span>speaks</span>” of the divide between them: it bridges and opens a yawning chasm of misunderstanding; it expresses the perception of mutual loss for the viewer.</p>
        <p>Paul’s performance of this condition, as violinist, connects him to Helen’s emotional state, one he gives expression for her. It also reminds of his professional status—of the choices that he, as a man of talent, possesses. The music testifies to his right to stand on stage in a concert hall, to be a success, to make it in the world. Moreover, the pain he describes, though emanating from the vibrations his body instigates, remains a <em>representation</em> for him (at this point)—it is something he “<span>paints</span>” sonorously and experiences only unconsciously. Helen’s performance is in part a tribute to the beauty and power of his, a response to the “<span>truth</span>” that she hears in what he plays (love is doomed), as well as an effort to escape its signification (for she blocks her ears as she paces the deserted beach, trying to get his music out of her head). For Helen, moreover, the tragedy expressed in the music relates to her experience—it “<span>plays</span>” out her life in a way she appreciates with acute self-consciousness. Her magnificent gesture of self-annihilation also has a social meaning connected to the “<span>choices</span>” available to her as a woman. Helen, that is, has two options: marriage or death. In the sense that Helen is Paul’s patroness, she has midwifed his music. The music, “<span>his</span>” voice, is her music as well, as she has provided the means for the voice to be heard. She is the listening subject, like the spectator: the voice is both hers and not hers. Helen, who has “<span>created</span>” Paul Boray, cannot create herself. To retain what little power she has in the world (power to support/create artists, rather than to be one herself)—she rejects the role of wife. Thus, the distinction between their respective experiences should not be confused. Paul’s is aesthetic, the absorption of man with his work, while Helen’s is political, a free fall out of an intolerable social reality.</p>
        <p>A highly charged “<span>point-of-view</span>” shot, in conjunction with the highly subjective “<span>voice-off</span>” of the music, thus slips from a description of character consciousness(es) (inviting us to understand and identify with these two characters simultaneously) to perform a discursive function in the film. This moment foregrounds the question of “<span>I</span>” on both the image and sound track, exhibiting itself as a site of enunciation.1 This discourse is radically heterogeneous, pointing to a contradiction between two subjectivities even as it unites them, articulating strongly a host of ideological frictions that characterize the film as a whole—frictions between feminine and masculine discourse. That this moment is one of <em>drowning</em> points not only to death but also to desire. Awash in music, swept away by the oceanic beyond, her dress glittering like the sky and water around her, Helen’s death expresses a dissolution into longing and sensuality, an ecstatic culmination rather than a mortal end. This is no ordinary, depressing suicide but an operatic flourish that reduces Paul’s subjective significance (playing the violin) to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">score</em>. Helen and Paul at this moment are both in a state of desire, expressed between them in distinct performances. Their subjectivities, in a sense, signify desire <em>between</em> them, offscreen sound coming to express them simultaneously. This scene represents their desire as transcendent and sacrificial (which can be read ideologically as both bourgeois [love = the sublime] and radical [marriage = death]). The “<span>impossible look</span>” at the beyond, moreover, as Helen drowns, bears witness to her subjective power: for “<span>the representation of desire is often embedded in the formal act of enunciation</span>”.2 Crawford’s character’s subjectivity is a force that speaks in this film, to the point where the narrative is lost without her. After her apotheosis, Garfield’s character’s problems cease to interest us. We realize the film, which initially presented itself as his story, was really “<span>about</span>” her. A feminine discourse finds expression alongside that of an apparently strongly entrenched masculine one, in the very “<span>silencing</span>” of the female protagonist most strongly aligned with a subjective point of view.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Listening for “<span>What a Woman Wants</span>”</h3>
        <p>Christine Gledhill has pointed out that “<span>discourse . . . [can be] distinguished from point of view in that the latter is attached to a particular character or authorial position, while a discourse stretches across the text through a variety of different articulations of which character is only one; it need not be coherent but can be broken by a number of shorter or longer gaps or silences</span>”.3 Her stress on the “<span>gaps and silences</span>” that may characterize a discourse is particularly pertinent in looking at the discourses “<span>stretching</span>” across the film texts analyzed in this chapter, all of which are incoherent in the sense that the positions of enunciation which produce them are fragmentary in nature and linked to an unstable (sometimes because they are unknown, other times because they are silenced or displaced) character source. The tracing of discursive movement in films bearing female voice-off represents a challenge, because of the fluidity and ambiguity of the voice’s “<span>authoriality</span>” in the text. The “<span>status</span>” of the voice-off is constantly changing, metamorphosing, and there are a number of factors to keep in mind while trying to chart its course: fluctuations in “<span>grain</span>”, its evolving relationship to the image, mutating perspectives as different characters “<span>speak</span>” as voice-off, etc. Discourse, that is, is not a static “<span>position</span>” outside the text, a monolithic structure enveloping it. Rather, discourse “<span>speaks</span>” through the film, “<span>through</span>” the female voice-off—not “<span>as</span>” it. This chapter explores the emergence, via the female voice-off, of a feminine discourse that coexists in contradiction to the patriarchal in a formative dynamic. Throughout, the connections between feminine discursive empowerment (such as is expressed through female voice-off, speech generally, writing, or other forms of discursive production) and female desire raise central and absorbing questions. What do/did women want—the women represented in the films and the women watching them—and how are such desires articulated within the texts where these figures intersect? Moreover, if, as J. P. Telotte has suggested, discourse is “<span>privileged over sexuality and revealed as the true route of desire</span>”, what can we learn from films in which sexuality itself is a powerful discursive force?4 What is the nature of enunciation in films in which formal disjunction, conflicting desires, disparate discourses, and contradictory will-to-meanings surface? Finally, how may the spectatorial address of women (in the 1940s and more recently) by and in these films deploy a politics of speech and voice that opens onto a subjective experience of contradiction? In these films, in fact, the female voice-off signifies an effort to address the spectator who relates her own experiences to those she sees on screen. But it also speaks of heterogeneous consciousness, an awareness of a paradoxical discursive “<span>place</span>”, of a self that is also other, eliciting recognition of the subjectivity of women <em>in a plurality</em>. Ultimately, this plurality becomes political. These films strikingly romanticize and resurrect a female experience that excludes men, and they evoke a shared feminine politic that exists in dynamic tension with “<span>dominant</span>” ideology. The voice-off, then, exacerbates not merely our consciousness of the constructive force of difference between voice and image, but provokes a recognition of the different, plural subjects who speak, despite and through contradiction, in patriarchy.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Click of a Camera: Sound (and Words) of Desire</h3>
        <p>In his famous evocation of the classical Hollywood cinema’s simultaneous exhibitionist and “<span>secretive</span>” relationship to the spectator, Christian Metz cites Émile Benveniste to describe the double movement by which <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> presents itself simultaneously as both discourse and as story. Metz links the problem of cinema’s ideological contract to the symbolic positioning of the spectator and the subject’s desire, stressing that while the “<span> . . . traditional film is presented as story . . . it is discourse: . . . the very principle of [its] effectiveness . . . is precisely that it obliterates all traces of the enunciation, and masquerades as story</span>”.5 In Metz’s terms, “<span>story</span>” and “<span>discourse</span>” are really the same thing in a classically constructed film, “<span>story</span>” being an alias, a mask that hides the discourse from us. “<span>Story</span>”, thus, works as an ideological Trojan horse of discourse, acting as its apparently innocent, “<span>transparent</span>” representation.</p>
        <p>Metz’s understanding of story/discourse links their production explicitly to the camera, and, within the film text (and the spectator’s experience of that text), to the image. Metz is not alone in this regard: Kaja Silverman notes the “<span>surprising unanimity</span>” with which writers like Metz, Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, Jean-Louis Baudry, Laura Mulvey, Jean-Pierre Oudart, and others have “<span>identified cinema’s discursive function with the visual axis</span>”.6 Metz, specifically, insists on the visible and on the gaze as the loci of discursive production in cinema, with a number of telling metaphors. Referring to processes of reflexivity that structure identification in relation to the primal scene, for example, he alludes only to the visual register of the child’s experience in the dark. This is a scenario in which, as Guy Rosolato has noted, the question of sound is already foregrounded in Freud’s description.7 Freud’s female patient fantasizes the “<span>click</span>” of a camera while lovemaking; this acoustic detail leads Rosolato to reinterpret the primal scene in terms of sound—the “<span>click</span>” representing/recalling the sound the parents make, as well as the sound that would give the hidden child away. Thus the position of the voyeur, so central to the question of the spectator’s desire, entails an awareness both of sound and a consciousness of contradiction, of being both “<span>here</span>” and “<span>there</span>”, “<span>object</span>” and “<span>subject</span>”. Metz also stresses the image’s confinement to the screen, and the fundamental disavowal beneath the apparent exhibitionism of the image, which “<span>makes it (at best) a beautiful closed object which must remain unaware of the pleasure it gives us . . . whose contours remain intact and which cannot therefore be torn open into an inside and an outside, into a subject capable of saying, ‘Yes!’</span>”8 He sees a voyeuristic paralysis in the “<span>spectatorfish, taking in everything with their eyes, nothing with their bodies . . . [a spectator who,] hooked up to himself by the invisible thread of sight . . . [identified with] . . . a self filtered out into pure vision . . . , [preliminarily] identifies with the (invisible) seeing agency of the film itself as discourse, as the agency which <em>puts forward</em> the story and shows it to us</span>”.9</p>
        <p>Thus, within this discussion of discourse emerges a second discourse, within film theory, one that heralds the primacy of the image in cinema, the “<span>pure</span>”-ness of all-seeing-ness, and the reduction (and confinement) of enunciation to a story that is apprehended solely through the eyes.10 The slippage here, gliding between the phenomenon of the image and its strikingly suggestive metapsychological relationship to a viewer, the processes of narration, and the enunciation of discourse is both elegant, rhetorically, and truly misleading. For if, as Silverman has pointed out, it is not at all obvious “<span>who is speaking</span>” in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (as a discursive enunciator), then it is still less obvious that the image is “<span>all</span>” that “<span>speaks</span>”.11 As we have seen, the spectator of the sound film cannot be accurately described as in “<span>a state of . . . pure visual capacity</span>”, as Metz suggests.12 Doane has noted that not only is sound not necessarily “<span>subordinate</span>” to the image, but “<span>it is doubtful that any image (in the sound film) is uninflected by sound</span>”.13 If the image produces discourse, then, so does sound. Or, perhaps more accurately, the image and sound track produce discourse(s) together, between them.</p>
        <p>Yet Metz’s main point here remains trenchant, in his insistence on the ideological “<span>transparency</span>” of the story—its will-to-meaning that keeps the spectator happily unaware of the production process, the institutional face of the cinema, or the enunciation of discourse. To account for sound, and, specifically, the discursive function of speech (which is highlighted through voice-off in the cinema), then, is it simply a matter of extending the analogy, of blending these signifiers into the image as elements of that infamous exhibitionism that courts the spectator’s eye (and also) ear, only to pretend it is not “<span>speaking</span>” at all? The seductive simplicity of this resolution should be questioned on (at least) two counts. First, the exhibitionist nature of a “<span>speaker</span>” (a voice bearing speech in the cinema) is very different from that of an image: it hails the subject, often quite explicitly, rather than via the disavowal Metz describes relative to the image, especially in cases of voice-off that distinctly underscore their direct address to the viewer. Just as those moments when a character looks at the camera are generally considered to “<span>break the frame</span>” and to draw attention to the place and process of enunciation, the voice-off acknowledges the viewer directly, and articulates an “<span>I-you</span>” relationship audibly, betraying itself without dissimulation. Speech, in fact, as Foucault describes it, has a privileged relationship to discourse. “<span>In appearance, speech may well be of little account, but the prohibitions surrounding it soon reveal its links with desire and power. This should not be very surprising, for psychoanalysis has already shown us that speech is not merely the medium which manifests—or dissembles—desire; it is also <em>the object of desire</em>. Similarly, historians have constantly impressed upon us that speech is no mere verbalization of conflicts and systems of domination, but that it is the very object of man’s conflicts</span>”.14 Foucault also notes, “<span>we are not free to say just anything</span>”; moreover, he warns that the rules of exclusion and prohibition can tell us as much about discourse (and speech) as what is pronounced.15 Looked at this way, the explicit foregrounding of speech within a film seems a crucial signpost in tracing the discursive operations of a film. What is said and what is left <em>unsaid</em> bear equal weight in Foucault’s theory: thus the discourse “<span>expressed</span>” through speech in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> may be apprehended not only through what characters say but how speech is used and defined within the film, whose speech is valorized and whose is restricted, how silence “<span>works</span>”, and how different “<span>voices</span>” intersect, commingle, or compete. In looking for “<span>who is speaking</span>” in the cinema, then, one needs to look not only at the image but at its relationship to sound and to the relative status of speech and voices within the sound track. All these factors count, not in isolation but in their interaction and contradistinction.</p>
        <p>Second, voice and speech, in contributing to the production of discourse of and in a film, may also “<span>speak</span>” differently from the discourse produced by the image, thus producing an occasion of contradiction. Such contradiction should not be understood as simply the effect of authorial strategies or of an alternative textual reading imposed by a spectator, but as a fundamental movement traceable in all discursive forms. As regards the cinema, contradictory discourses can be observed in classical films as well as in those with alternative signifying practices. The nonpatriarchal discourse, far from being “<span>contained</span>” and visible only at moments of rupture or aberration, is a formative enunciatory element, fundamental to the structure of representation. Kaja Silverman argues persuasively for the need to think of dominant <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in other than “<span>monolithically phallic</span>” terms. She ultimately suggests, however, that “<span>authorial voices that speak against the operations of dominant meaning [are] . . . much likelier to manifest themselves through isolated formal and diegetic irregularities than through formal systematicity</span>”, echoing a familiar strain of feminist theory which sees the ideological movement of the classical film as virtually unassailable, except in “<span>weak</span>” spots, such as those produced by excess.16 However, transgression can be seen as not only part of narrative movement per se (the introduction of heterogeneity inspiring the forward drive) but as part of the pleasure of texts, even (or especially) some of those we normally think of as “<span>conventional</span>”. The introduction of a female voice-off indicates an explicit surplus of contradiction, foregrounding the pleasure of heterogeneity—one that capitalizes on the nature of sound film in both marking the gap between sound and image, and fully exploiting it. The principle of ideological “<span>containment</span>” (of difference, for example, or of the feminine, in classical films) has, moreover, become a dangerously inhibiting discourse itself. In the well-meaning attempt to articulate how women have been “<span>suppressed</span>” by texts, another suppression takes place on the level of theory, wherein we are forced into corners “<span>defending</span>” the impossibility of our own subjectivity.</p>
        <p>One of the most pernicious of such descriptions relates to the frequent observation that feminine discourse or subjectivity is often associated with “<span>interiority</span>” and/or “<span>space</span>” in the diegesis. This “<span>interiority</span>” has been invariably represented as necessarily translating into a <em>negative</em> value— resulting in the containment and repression of the feminine. (A parallel alignment with “<span>exteriority</span>” and “<span>narrative linearity</span>” translates into a positive affirmation of the masculine subject.) In part, such assumptions have been drawn from narratological theories that identify agency and forward narrative movement with the male hero, so that a non-“<span>forward</span>” narrative inflection associated with a female character translates into “<span>stasis</span>” or “<span>regression</span>” by default.17 Signs of feminine subjectivity that “<span>only exist at the expense of the forward trajectory of the narrative</span>” are interpreted as necessarily rebounding back into signs of objectification.18 The description of a vertical or “<span>backward</span>” (flashback) movement of a narrative as “<span>static</span>”, or “<span>regressive</span>”, especially in cinema, where time contributes to our experience of story in a direct way, should be questioned. In another direction, this negative value placed on interiority derives from psychoanalytic models that confuse the interior of the diegesis with the unknowable nether regions of the pre-Symbolic. The viability of transposing psychoanalytic metaphors, as Silverman has, onto textual movements per se seems a questionable enterprise. Though the subject’s experience of the body as self indisputably brings up the descriptive categories of interiority and exteriority, the spatiality involved—a psychic one in many respects—differs significantly from the represented “<span>spatiality</span>” of or within narrative movement. Moreover, as described at length in Chapter 1, the association of the voice-off with interiority carries with it the simultaneous recognition of difference (exteriority, within this paradigm). These terms, “<span>interior</span>” and “<span>exterior</span>”, then, have been brilliantly extended from a psychoanalytic domain, as well as, to a degree, from phenomenological debates, and brought to bear on the problem of discursive enunciation in classical (and other) films. They have been compellingly described by feminists in theories that have severely compromised the possibility for woman’s speech—and for feminine discourse—to be “<span>heard</span>” in most classical Hollywood films. The definitions of these terms themselves (“<span>interior</span>” and “<span>exterior</span>”), not at all self-evident, however, need clarification, as they are deployed differently in different theories, particularly in the two most influential—those developed by Doane and Silverman. Few critics have taken issue with the depressing scenarios associated with the paradigms outlined below. However, they deserve close inspection—for on them turns the possibility of the articulation and recognition of feminine discourse within representation produced in patriarchy.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Spatial Realms and Enunciation: Body as Text</h3>
        <p>Mary Ann Doane explores the voice’s relationship to the body via a spatial metaphor. She suggests different spatial descriptions for several possible relations: the synch voice (anchored to a body); voice-off (belonging to a body, but “<span>deepening the diegesis</span>”, and heterogeneous to the image); the voice-over interior monologue (turning the body “<span>inside-out</span>”, representing its “<span>inner lining</span>”); and voice-over documentary commentary (disembodied— traditionally male). Thus Doane’s spatial/sound scheme works according to a certain progression from “<span>inside</span>” to “<span>outside</span>”, with the voice-over commentary dwelling, since it is “<span>not localizable . . . [or] yoked to a body . . . in a radical otherness with respect to the diegesis which endows this voice with a certain <em>authority</em> . . . <em>outside</em> [diegetic] <em>space</em></span>”.19 The vocabulary she uses is revealing, betraying a phobia about voices “<span>yoked</span>” to bodies, and a localization of power and authority with the “<span>exterior</span>”. As discussed earlier in this book, this lexicon portrays voice as bearing subjectivity <em>only</em> if disassociated from the body, appealing to a mode of thinking that equates distance with knowledge. Such distance coincides more comfortably with a visual articulation of character relations and diegetic space than with an aural one. The “<span>discourse of distance</span>”, in fact, is another “<span>problem</span>” perhaps for feminists to begin to question. For, despite the leftist-seeming model of distantiation that is Bertolt Brecht’s legacy, this “<span>position</span>” relative to a text seems analogous to a patriarchal “<span>viewing</span>” position—certainly, it is very similar to the subjective transcendence Baudry has suggested is part and parcel of an ideological placement.20 Within Doane’s analysis, however, the strict correlation of the “<span>internal</span>” to a feminine space and the “<span>external</span>” to the masculine one is not manifest, except in her observation that most voice-over commentaries are male voices-off. (It is significant, moreover, that she allows for a truly “<span>disembodied</span>” voice-over only with respect to documentary: does Doane mean to suggest that it is generic convention that moves the voice to the outside? In this case, the discussion may turn not on voice, but on the relationship of fiction to reality as brought out by generic conventions.)21</p>
        <p>Silverman’s work extends Doane’s spatial taxonomy into a complicated hierarchy of progressive and relative embodiments, and explicitly maps the “<span>interior</span>” of the diegesis onto the feminine and the “<span>exterior</span>” onto the masculine. She claims that a “<span>rule of synchronization</span>” exists within classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> that invariably brings a voice “<span>back</span>” to its body, and she suggests that this rule is more emphatically pursued with regard to the female than to the male voice, because the male subject (to whom all Hollywood texts, in her view, are dedicated) projects his own lack onto the female image/ voice as a kind of protective distantiation. Silverman’s view of discourse and enunciation is deeply entrenched in her complex psychoanalytic preamble, especially as regards the elaboration of diegetic spatiality. Generally speaking, Silverman falls in line with the view that equates diegetic power with disembodiment: “<span> . . . the voice-over is privileged to the degree that <em>it transcends the body</em>. Conversely, it loses power and authority with every corporeal encroachment, from a regional accent or idiosyncratic ‘grain’ to definitive localization in the image</span>”.22 Synchronization, a complete “<span>embodiment</span>” within her theory, is a strong nail in the coffin barring characters from discursive authority. Although she acknowledges that complete disembodiment is rare for <em>either</em> a male or a female voice-off in Hollywood cinema, she asserts that “<span>nevertheless, in his most exemplary guise, classic cinema’s male subject sees without being seen, and speaks from an inaccessible vantage point</span>”.23 How a “<span>rare</span>” condition can be assumed to be “<span>exemplary</span>” is left unexplained, as she moves on immediately to discuss the “<span>embodied</span>” male voice-over, suggesting that the characters bearing it are by no means invariably “<span>invisible</span>”, “<span>powerful</span>”, or unconstrained by or within narrative. Indeed, Silverman describes these embodied male voiceovers in terms that she will later conflate with “<span>femininity</span>”, saying that the voice-overs of films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sunset Boulevard, Out of the Past, D. O. A</em>., etc., because they introduce flashbacks, “<span>anchor [the voice] to the order of the spectacle and the gaze, suggesting that its regressive journey carries it to the heart of the diegesis, rather than to the latter’s outer edges</span>”.24 This statement, looked at retroactively in relation to remarks Silverman makes later in her book, is provocative in that Silverman here acknowledges that diegetic “<span>interiority</span>” <em>can</em> be the province of the male as well as the female subject (something subsequent chapters are apt to disallow). It also reveals a tendency to generalize about the functioning of voice-off to image, as she implies that all these voices-off “<span>work</span>” the same way, to simply “<span>accompany . . . [the] flashback</span>”.25 Not only are the aural and narrative characteristics of these voices-off rather different in the various films she mentions (in terms of grain, performance, tonality, frequency, etc.) but even <em>within the same film</em> the voice-off often operates differently at different moments. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Out of the Past</em>, for example, Robert Mitchum’s voice-off speaks first in synch, “<span>drifting</span>” back into a flashback, the voice “<span>accompanying</span>” the image for a while, as Silverman describes. A little later, however, the voice sometimes takes up without a return to Mitchum’s face (and, significantly, these sections bring us closer to his desire). Thus one must question the accuracy of her description of these voices-off as merely “<span>translating</span>” what they say <em>into images</em>—since the voice in these instances does not merely give way to the visual register to have the image “<span>tell all</span>”. Rather, it operates simultaneous to it. Mitchum’s voice-off intersects with the image and thus <em>inflects</em> the meaning. Silverman’s theoretical point becomes clear, though, with this determined conflation of flashback (“<span>regressive journey</span>”) with the image and with an “<span>interior</span>” diegetic space she associates to “<span>the order of the spectacle and the gaze</span>”.26 Her rhetoric, that is, stresses an identification between an “<span>interior</span>” flashback space and the feminine—both of which she posits as discursively “<span>impotent</span>” in the classical cinema.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Direct/Indirect Auditory Mastery: “<span>Raping</span>” the Voice-off</h3>
        <p>When Silverman turns from a general discussion of “<span>embodied voice-over</span>” to consider its incarnation as “<span>internal monologue</span>” in films, she subtly turns the screw of her argument. She slides almost imperceptibly from a discussion of “<span>embodied <em class="notranslate" translate="no">male</em> voice-over</span>” to “<span>embodied <em class="notranslate" translate="no">female</em> voiceover</span>” (without drawing our attention explicitly to this shift in emphasis), characterizing them in negative terms of involuntary “<span>constraint</span>”. The fact that she does not mention or account for male voice-over examples of “<span>internal monologue</span>” (the type of male “<span>embodied voice-over</span>” found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dark Passage</em> or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve</em>, for example) implies that “<span>interior monologue</span>” is more characteristic of female voice-off (a fair generalization). But it also suggests that the “<span>involuntary</span>” or constrained quality she notes in embodied voice-over has particularly to do with these <em class="notranslate" translate="no">female</em> voices (and, in fact, she only first mentions this “<span>involuntary</span>” attribute once she turns to the female voices-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beguiled</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bonjour Tristesse</em>). Her description of these voices as “<span>constrained</span>” rests on a reasoning that describes female voice-off as subjected, in these instances, to a kind of metaphorical rape. Borrowing from Doane, she notes that the internal monologue, “<span>turns the body ‘inside out’ . . . like a searchlight suddenly turned upon a character’s thoughts: it makes audible what is ostensibly inaudible, transforming the private into public</span>”.27 She continues, “<span>On these occasions the discursive mode is direct rather than indirect. No distance separates teller from tale; instead, the voice-over is stripped of temporal protection and thrust into diegetic immediacy. Thus deprived of enunciatory pretense, it is no longer in a position to masquerade as the point of textual origin. Moreover, since this voice-over derives from an interior rather than an exterior register (in other words, since it represents thought rather than speech) the listener’s access to it is unlicensed by the character from whom it derives, and so clearly constitutes a form of auditory mastery</span>”.28</p>
        <p>Where the embodied male voice-over, in Silverman’s account, suffers from a little specularity, the embodied female voice-over sustains a much more aggressive intrusion—it is the victim/object of the discursive invasion and “<span>unlicensed listening</span>” of the spectator/subject, and it cannot pretend to enunciate itself. Silverman sees the female voice-off as vulnerable in this way, because it is more direct. “<span>Unprotected</span>” by the factor that might keep it intact—a temporal disjunction from the image that provides “<span>distance</span>”—the (female) interior monologue is stuck “<span>inside</span>” the image, inside the diegesis.</p>
        <p>Silverman does not mention any films with male voice-off that can be said to suffer from the same contaminating “<span>immediacy</span>” that makes what is more “<span>direct</span>” (surprisingly) <em>less</em> expressive of subjectivity than what is mediated. Most views of the interior monologue, as demonstrated in the previous chapter, are in fact at odds with Silverman’s view that such directness constitutes an objectification. The very marking of directness by any formal attribute in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is usually associated with enunciatory privilege, and with the apparatus (here, imagined to include sound recording). To a degree, Silverman’s logic seems inflected by a similar, but often contradictory, mistrust of “<span>directness</span>” evident also in Doane’s work. Doane suggests that the “<span>voice-over</span>” commentary is the form of greatest directness in auditory “<span>address</span>” in that it “<span>speaks without mediation to the audience, bypassing the ‘characters’ and establishing a complicity between itself and the spectator—together they understand and thus <em>place</em> the image</span>”.29 “<span>Directness</span>”, in her account, seems to denote intimacy and the sharing of knowledge (understanding). Later, in extending this analogy to what she calls the “<span>voice-off</span>” category, Doane suggests that the intervention of the character presence makes the relationship <em>less direct</em> and thus situates the spectator in the eavesdropper’s position, a position she likens to voyeurism.30 The use of the word “<span>direct</span>” in the two theorists’ work ultimately becomes confusing and seemingly arbitrary, when compared to one another. Ironically, Doane sees the most “<span>exterior</span>” voice as the most “<span>direct</span>” and the most intimate (complicit), while Silverman sees the more “<span>interior</span>” voice as most direct. Unlike Doane, Silverman understands directness of address to be a sign not of complicity but of radical separation or mediation (one that is aggressive).</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Interior = Inferior: The Fated Place of the Woman’s Voice</h3>
        <p>Whereas Doane’s explication links all the voices she discusses in pointing out their universal appeal to the invocatory drive, Silverman’s analysis works to single out the female voice-off and to establish its particular objectification within classical cinema. She thus slips the question from degrees of “<span>embodiment</span>” onto an implicit “<span>voyeurism</span>”, ironically using the same psychoanalytic model Metz employs when writing about the filmic image to describe the voice, a nonvisual signifier. This “<span>voyeurism</span>”, as the spectator “<span>spies</span>” on the character’s inner thoughts, she claims, is routinely exploited in the “<span>direct</span>” expression of the interior monologue so often adopted by the female voice-off. Her shift from the body to the image here, moreover, stages a second leap of logic, one that pins the problem of “<span>interiority</span>” and non-discursivity to the female voice-off (and the female character) even more resolutely.</p>
        <p>While concluding her remarks on the embodied voice-over, Silverman claims that it “<span>designates not only psychological but diegetic interiority . . . it emanates from the center of the story, rather than from some radically other time and place</span>”.31 The displacement of the psychological onto the diegetic, which she considers obvious at this point, however, is really still a tenuous point. It depends, for one thing, on a visual narrative structuration— the flashback—which, though often <em>associated</em> to the voice-off, is not exactly the same thing. Moreover, it seems Silverman assumes that the image determines the “<span>fate</span>” of the sound here. She sees the flashbacks as determinant of meaning in conscribing the voice to diegetic interiority, rather than, for example, entertaining the notion that the intrusion of voiceoff into a flashback can suggest a contradictory temporality in a dynamic fashion (past/present–forward/backward signifying simultaneously). Further, her conclusion depends on an idiosyncratic reading of a certain kind of “<span>directness</span>” of speech/thought, one representing “<span>indirectness</span>” and objectification (as described above). Paradoxically, the spectator’s “<span>direct</span>” relationship to the interior monologue allows (him) both the distanced protection of the eavesdropper <em>and</em> the violent “<span>subjectivity</span>” of the rapist. Finally, the paradigms of “<span>directness</span>” vs. “<span>interiority</span>” become increasingly confused and cross-referenced until they seem synonymous not only with each other but also with non-discursivity in Silverman’s theory. Both these tropes (interiority/directness) are frequently invoked in much film theory (and in other sections of Silverman’s book itself) as “<span>signs</span>” of subjectivity. It seems, however, that Silverman equates discursive enunciation with a position of diegetic, “<span>externally-coded</span>” authority and power alone. Indeed, there is, in her book, a surprising lack of any search for a representation of “<span>subjectivity</span>” in these films, beyond those described in metaphors of distanced patriarchal projection on the part of a male subject. Attempting to find forms of female subjectivity represented <em>in the same way</em> that male subjectivity is constructed in these films may be a vain pursuit. Should one applaud, for example, the female character’s transposition onto or ascension to a place of patriarchal “<span>power and authority</span>” or “<span>exteriority</span>” to the diegesis as such, if it were “<span>possible</span>”? Female subjectivity is something Silverman seems to be searching for elsewhere in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>, (and feminine subjectivity is something she argues persuasively to “<span>exist</span>” within both patriarchy and psychoanalysis). However, in the Hollywood cinema, she maintains, a vise-like discursive grip on the female character is absolute, constraining her to the interior, “<span>inferior</span>” position.32</p>
        <p>Silverman implies that this equation should be taken <em>literally</em> with respect to Hollywood films, discounting a strong symbolic heritage in Western culture which equates interiority with centrality, consciousness, depth, and primacy, through its metaphorical relationship to the mind and the heart. Viewed in this light, female voices-off that emerge exclusively from the center of the text, as is the case in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Locket, The Enchanted Cottage</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Barefoot Contessa</em> may well reflect the narrative primacy of these characters rather than their subordination. Each speaks, for one thing, quite literally of her desire. In each of these films, moreover, “<span>embeddedness</span>” does not necessarily translate into increased specularity. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Locket</em> (1946), Nancy relates a traumatic experience from her childhood in a noneroticizing sequence in which her subjective resistance is pitted against the capitalist/patriarchal law that falsely marks her desire as perverse.33 In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Enchanted Cottage</em> (1945), Dorothy McGuire’s character attains (an imagined) specular beauty within the scene she co-voices with Robert Young, a loveliness that the film renders a <em>spiritual</em> quality, one specifically critical of the objectifying gaze. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Barefoot Contessa</em> (1954), Ava Gardner finally has her say in one of the only sequences to privilege her feelings and thoughts over the enigma and statuesque allure that obsesses the male voices-off in her regard. It should be noted that she is struggling to understand her husband, though, just as the Bogart character is hoping to share her point of view: these three consciousnesses provide for the spectator/auditor’s view <em>between</em>. In any event, these seemingly frail female voices-off, which, after long silence, suddenly speak from deep “<span>within</span>” the text, rather than from its “<span>outer edges</span>”, cut to the heart of what is at stake in these films: the contradictory experience of subjectivity for a woman in patriarchy.</p>
        <p>Although Silverman acknowledges that diegetic interiority is also inhabited by male characters, she suggests that certain mechanisms (the “<span>systematization</span>” of the Hollywood machine) “<span>displace the privileged attributes of the disembodied voice-over onto the <em>synchronized</em> male voice . . . [re-inscribe] the opposition between the diegetic and the extradiegetic</span>” within the fiction itself. As a result of these mechanisms, interiority and exteriority are redefined as areas within the narrative rather than as indicators of the great divide separating the diegesis from the enunciation. “<span>‘Inside’ comes to designate a recessed space within the story while ‘outside’ refers to those elements of the story which seem in one way or another to frame that recessed space. Woman is confined to the former, and man to the latter</span>”.34 In this account, the female character with voiceoff bears a double burden of impotence—not only is she associated with the image per se through her specularity, but the “<span>recessed</span>” space from which her voice-off emanates “<span>folds her in</span>” to the diegesis, smothering any vestige of enunciatory sassiness. In the meantime, the male voice, even synchronized, enjoys more discursive power. The diegetic “<span>containment</span>” of female voice-off, Silverman suggests, can be traced to three operations—via “<span>doubly diegeticized</span>” representations of voice (where it is “<span>performed</span>” by the character or overheard by both spectator and a fictional “<span>eavesdropper</span>”), “<span>talking cures</span>” (where she speaks “<span>involuntarily</span>”), and through the insertion of “<span>grain</span>” into her voice (standing in for her body).35 Adrienne L. McLean convincingly argues, however, that the inscription of “<span>performance</span>”, rather than entrenching a doubly “<span>representational</span>” constraint, emphasizes the female character’s enunciative capacity, in her direct address to the spectator, her “<span>auto-eroticism</span>”, and her “<span>resistance</span>” through the ironic self-awareness of herself as an object of the gaze as she “<span>flaunts her castration</span>” openly. McLean, significantly, points to sound (music and singing in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gilda</em>) as an alternate, “<span>competing</span>” discursive formation to that of the image, stressing, however, that, “<span>music alone cannot be the great alternative; it matters what is done with it</span>”.36</p>
        <p>Another notable weakness in Silverman’s argument lies in the ease of its “<span>fit</span>” with theories of spectatorship and enunciation that have been conducted relative to the image alone. It seems, in many respects, the result of an effort to force the voice-off into the service of what is implicitly assumed to “<span>rule</span>” discourse in a film anyway—the image. As noted above, much of Silverman’s argument here rests on rhetorical slidings and shiftings whereby she maps the “<span>interior</span>” onto the feminine and vice versa. She conflates “<span>psychological</span>” interiority with diegetic interiority. But, interestingly, she reverses the values one normally would expect to find expressed there, suggesting that if we “<span>hear thought</span>”, we are not complicit with a character or “<span>being spoken to</span>” (except by a phallocentric monolith of male subjectivity), but rather we are forcing ourselves on her, in an objectifying way. She argues against the possibility that, for example, the represented “<span>thought</span>” a voice-off expresses can also designate speech (which it “<span>is</span>” on one level at least, as a voice bearing words to our ear), consciousness (as a representation of a vital mind’s awareness of and communication of itself), poetry (as the “<span>inside</span>” of an “<span>outside</span>” suggested by the image, or a differing or contradictory expression to what we see), or really <em>anything</em> but the “<span>inside</span>” of a body (if it is associated with a female character), because, she claims, Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> “<span>sees</span>” the woman’s psyche this way. This argumentation forecloses the discursive (im)possibilities of the female voice-off because of the ideological and psychoanalytic assumptions drawn regarding the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> prior to analysis. In this respect, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em> falls prey to what David Bordwell calls contemporary film theory’s “<span> . . . [neglect] of what 1960s semiology took as a primary task: the explication of the intersubjective but tacit conventions whereby we ‘make sense’ of texts at a literal, denotative level</span>”—as witnessed in the lack of analysis of the (classical) films themselves, as Silverman’s book pursues a globalizing theory.37 Crucially, moreover, the terminology that she painstakingly sets out eventually becomes misleading, for she “<span>types</span>” voices according to the hierarchical schema of embodiments she devises, and she evaluates their relative interior/exterior placement within the diegesis as if the voice predictably and invariably functions identically to all other variants of voice-off that share the same technical category of “<span>bodily status</span>”. A sweeping generalization, this logic undermines the importance of textual structuration as a process (something Silverman, ironically, stresses at points). Moreover, as Silverman herself notes, these voices are constantly <em>fluctuating</em> in their relationship to a represented body and to diegetic interiority, and, thus, never really belong to one or another “<span>category</span>” as such. The relevance of this impressive array of technical strata devised for “<span>fixing</span>” voice relative to the body thus comes into question. The real point is that the voice-off is always threatening to <em>change</em>—to escape this relationship to the body; to mobilize another relationship; or to enounce itself at one moment as a “<span>voice-over</span>”, the next as “<span>an embodied voice-over</span>”, and the next as a “<span>voice-off</span>”, “<span>just outside</span>” the frame. In fact, voices-off can quite frequently occupy a number of these strata simultaneously—as in the example Silverman gives from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kiss Me Deadly</em>, when Christina’s voice is heard panting “<span>over</span>” the credits. Silverman calls this “<span>technically</span>” a voice-over, as it “<span>speaks from a different order from that to which the image belongs</span>”.38 Noting, however, that this voice-off is “<span>thick with body</span>” (Cloris Leachman’s throaty gasps, etc.), she concludes that even when granted a “<span>voice-over status</span>”, the female voice is thus “<span>embodied</span>”.39 But, since we have seen the character of Christina in the pre-credit sequence, this voice could also be called (in Silverman’s terms) an “<span>embodied voice-over</span>” or even a “<span>voiceoff</span>” (if we imagine that we are riding in the dark car and she is breathing just offscreen). It is precisely the ambiguity and fluidity of the voice in its relation to the body and to the text that defines it—a quality that, with regard to the classical cinema, Silverman is apt to disallow.40</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">“<span>Nobody’s</span>” Voice: The Proliferation of Plurality</h3>
        <p>Despite Silverman’s conviction that the female voice-off always finds itself folded into the diegesis in the classical film, she acknowledges that “<span>both the male and the female subjects are inside meaning, and neither can ever be the punctual source of that meaning</span>”.41 Silverman here is referring to Ideology at large, constraining both male and female characters. Her statement, however, also gives rise to the possibility of competing discourses, or contradictory ones, if, in a sense, “<span>no one</span>” is in “<span>control</span>” of the diegesis. In later chapters, for example, she suggests that female subjectivity and feminine enunciation can be located in films directed by women that were produced within patriarchal culture. She ascribes this possibility not to the conscious intent of the authors (although she comes very near to reactivating auteurism) but to the films’ evocation of desires that form and interpolate it.</p>
        <p>This logic invites one to imagine that different desires and discourses may also circulate in classical films. If, for example, in the oeuvre of Liliana Cavani, the female director’s desires can be represented by male “<span>self-castrating</span>” characters with whom she identifies herself, one wonders why a director like Lang, or Hitchcock, cannot be said to invest certain female characters with a concomitant enunciatory function.42 Can the “<span>voice</span>” of the male author not find an uncanny “<span>home</span>” in the female voice-off in films that align this voice with subjectivity or marked discursivity? Silverman herself notes with regard to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em>, that “<span>Rebecca</span>”, in her role as “<span>absent one</span>”, “<span>stands in for Hitchcock</span>”.43 She attributes this to Rebecca’s <em>invisibility</em>, however, and not to the express alignment of “<span>Rebecca’s/Joan Fontaine’s</span>” voice-off (at the beginning of the film) with the apparatus (and by extension Hitchcock). This alignment, however, is conveyed overtly on both the image and sound track. Like the relay of the gaze Raymond Bellour traces in his famous analysis of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marnie</em>, a vertical association here marks the spot of self-reflexivity, as the camera dollies “<span>subjectivistically</span>”, while the female voice-off directly addresses the viewer and declares her power to transgress the barred spaces and to tell her story (which “<span>began for [her] in the south of France</span>”). The real surrogate here for Hitchcock is not the “<span>absent</span>” Rebecca, except inasmuch as she “<span>is</span>” also Joan Fontaine’s character: the studied polish of Fontaine’s voice in this opening voice-off underscores that it stands in for not only her character’s voice (unnamed, and retroactively associated, remembering Manderley as it was before the fire), but also Rebecca’s (both through proximity to the title and in its “<span>cultivated</span>”, “<span>ghostly</span>” resonance) <em>and</em> Hitchcock’s (the Britishness of the grain). These several voices twining into one offer another example of the heterogeneity that the female voice-off sustains so effortlessly. Silverman looks for multiplicity of discourse through the proliferation of multiple unanchored voices in alternative films—we may also look for this pluralism “<span>within</span>” single voices within the classical diegesis, voices which “<span>speak</span>” of a number of subjectivities at once, or who enounce their simultaneous “<span>subjective</span>” and “<span>objectified</span>” relationship to discourse. Thus, discursively, the female voice-off is not necessarily “<span>folded in</span>” to diegetic interiority—it often also “<span>speaks</span>” from the edges, aligned with an authority (with which it may flex in tension).</p>
        <p>In the same way, a discursive plurality is inherent in the narrative movement of these films. A forward drive represented as “<span>interior</span>” should not primarily or only be viewed as one of “<span>constraint</span>”, especially when it constructs the bulk of the story, both in terms of screen time and screen action. The weighting of the narrative in this lateral direction implies both a discursive primacy (as bearer of meaning) and a strong coefficient of pleasure (as source of interest). Such films, tracking a different narrative course, inward rather than outward, still work as narratives after all. Doane and Silverman find these films deficient because they regard this inward movement as one that fails to emulate the “<span>linear</span>” impulse “<span>to the edges</span>” of the diegesis where they locate the “<span>source</span>” of enunciation. The movement to the interior, in their view, is a paralytic effect that immobilizes rather than empowers agency. Subjectivity/enunciation can only, they suggest, come from “<span>outside</span>”. In films such as these, however, in which the “<span>outside</span>” has only a slippery hold on a text, the “<span>inside</span>” moves in powerful, vertiginous cycles to involve the viewer in a drama (usually exploring a character’s subjectivity in some way). Surely, that “<span>interior</span>” movement is not devoid of discursive force. The question resurfaces: is “<span>subjectivity</span>” in a film (as a character attribute or as an enunciatory position that character may represent) only to be conceived of within the patriarchal configuration of distance, exteriority, and linearity?</p>
        <p>The strongly entrenched bias toward “<span>interior</span>” as “<span>inferior</span>” should be re-evaluated in feminist film theory, as should the conflation of specularity with narrative “<span>stasis</span>”—the view that interruptions to narrative flow (often posed by moments where some kind of feminine subjectivity is at stake) is somehow <em>negative</em> or testimony to the woman’s discursive impotence. Such “<span>interruptions</span>”, “<span>regressive journeys</span>”, “<span>recessions</span>”, “<span>metaphors</span>”, by whatever name, on the contrary, mark strong moments of <em>discursive contradiction</em> to the linear discourse that so many theorists identify as “<span>masculine</span>”. The “<span>movement</span>” is not to “<span>the edges</span>” but to “<span>the inside</span>”—a significant movement of opposition and of heterogeneity within the text. What to make, indeed, of a narrative that does not go anywhere, that “<span>folds in on itself</span>”? The fact is, it does go somewhere, it moves horizontally as it also moves vertically (through time). Its movement is paradoxical, perhaps, full of contradiction, but no film is literally “<span>stopped</span>” by this vertical folding, this spiraling structure. (It would cease to take place, to be a [narrative] film. As we know from the work of the ’60s avant-garde, even the experience of light and shadow relative to time eventually “<span>becomes</span>” narrative.) Rather, it goes somewhere else, taking a detour through what is often a female-centered story, just as often “<span>deviating</span>” from the malecentered story that opens the film. This long digression away from the male-centered narrative puts two temporalities into play, forward and lateral, creating narrative structures that, as described earlier, emerge as circular, vortexical. This digressiveness also mobilizes contradictory discourses that speak from “<span>different</span>” places within the film simultaneously. Such discursive forms are not only a form of “<span>power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is pursuing . . . [but are also its] opposite . . . power asserting itself in the pleasure of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting . . . These evasions, these circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes, not boundaries not to be crossed, but <em>perpetual spirals of power and pleasure</em></span>”.44 Discourses take winding, excessive, spiraling paths in films bearing voice-off. The heterogeneous signification of voice foregrounds contradiction, puts it more obviously into play throughout the text, buckling against constraint and coherence.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">“<span>Un-muzzling</span>” Contradiction: The Myth of Coherence</h3>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Archeology of Knowledge</em>, Foucault traces the analytical interest of coherence, explaining it as a principle that organizes discourse and restores it to unity. Coherence, he claims, is the production of a work exercised on a text; it is, in fact, <em>sought out</em> by the speaking subject.45 Moreover, Foucault expressly singles out analysis (and thus, by extension, the <em>analyst</em>) as “<span>suppressing contradiction as best it can</span>”.46 He goes on to describe the fundamental paradox that contradiction poses to coherence, stating that “<span>contradiction, far from being an appearance or accident of discourse, far from being that from which it must be freed if its truth is at last to be revealed, constitutes the very law of its existence: it is on the basis of such a contradiction that discourse emerges, and it is in order both to translate it and to overcome it that discourse begins to speak; it is in order to escape that contradiction, whereas contradiction is ceaselessly reborn through discourse, that discourse endlessly pursues itself and endlessly begins again</span>”.47</p>
        <p>Thus, contradiction and coherence structure each other, incite and elicit each other, co-exist in a dynamic relation that never abates in its productive movement. The desire for coherence, for intelligibility itself, bears the traces of this relationship—the structuring out of that which is illogical, that which signifies differently, that which is incoherent (this is perhaps of special interest for feminist theory, as the feminine is so often represented in exactly this way).</p>
        <p>The analogic relationship between Foucault’s description of contradiction and the workings of the Hegelian notion of self-consciousness as described in previous chapters is striking (as is a correspondence with the psychoanalytic subject’s heterogeneous relation to voice-off). Foucault in fact has warned, “<span>We have to determine the extent to which our anti- Hegelianism is possibly one of his tricks directed against us, at the end of which he stands, motionless, waiting for us</span>”.48 A concept common to both writers’ work, in fact, brings the notions of self-consciousness and discursive contradiction together: the formative contribution of paradox. Paradox represents a dynamic, one that, in Hegel’s description of subject/ object relations “<span>brings identity and difference together</span>” and one that, as an act of enunciation, Foucault has shown to be constitutive of discourse itself.49 Foucault describes, moreover, the paradoxical enunciation of the sophists as a form of discourse that permitted more room <em>between</em> thought and words, something Western thought has “<span>muzzled</span>”. This “<span>muzzling</span>”, he implies, makes meaning more obvious. Paradox, then “<span>un-muzzles</span>” meaning, rendering it less transparent, less coherent.50</p>
        <p>Paradox as invoked by these writers reveals a route toward dislodging the pessimistic assumption that patriarchal discourse always has the last word. Feminine discourse contradicts the patriarchal formatively and cannot be “<span>contained</span>” as such. The very impulse to view the patriarchal as a monolith that “<span>contains</span>” difference imposes an analytic coherence that should be questioned, and, ultimately, rejected. Of course, the kinds of studies that have investigated the mapping of power and desire in patriarchal discursive forms have undertaken a work of the greatest importance. However, there is something to be gained in looking away from models of coherence (even those critical of coherence in pointing it out) to bring forward possibilities of contradiction, of difference sustained, of dynamic paradox.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">That Obscure Subject of Discourse</h3>
        <p>Feminist film theory and criticism has a strong tradition of searching within texts for feminine discourse, locating and tracing its enunciation, only to (usually) resignedly bring it back under the shadow of the patriarchal at the last minute. Claire Johnston’s work, as Janet Bergstrom has pointed out, inaugurated a strong feminist tradition of searching for “<span>progressive classical texts</span>”, such as films made within the Hollywood system by women directors like Ida Lupino and Dorothy Arzner, which in Johnston’s view offered a kind of resistance to patriarchy through moments of strong rupture from prevailing ideology. As Bergstrom describes it, Johnston’s “<span>rupture thesis</span>” envisioned progressive texts as ones which both foregrounded the discourse of the woman “<span>while at the same time rendering the dominant discourse of the male fragmented and incoherent</span>”.51 Bergstrom points out, however, that Johnston’s work reflects a “<span>reified</span>” use of ideology and notes that the very ruptures Johnston points out as “<span>progressive</span>” are discussed by Stephen Heath as <em>fundamental</em> to the construction of the classical text.52 Bergstrom’s comments are provocative in suggesting that not only is contradiction within a text not necessarily anti-patriarchal or “<span>progressive</span>”, but that it may not necessarily be found only in films made by women. Further, she suggests, moments of “<span>rupture</span>” may not adequately demonstrate the workings of a text overall: there is a need, she insists, for filmic analyses to look at “<span>narrative movement as a whole</span>”, to study the “<span>process</span>” by which film “<span>produces meaning</span>”.53 Although Bergstrom’s essay indicates, at points, that the classical text ultimately smoothes out contradiction through its exploitation of redundant tropes, her final paragraph hints at a more optimistic view of such films. She argues, “<span>Textual analyses of the most classical of films . . . have shown consistently how women function in different but equally crucial ways to insure narrative, to position the enunciation</span>”.54</p>
        <p>In an article that responds to Bergstrom’s call for a sustained analysis of textual movement, rather than solely of moments of rupture, Jacquelyn Suter maps out the feminine discourse she sees at work in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Christopher Strong</em> and comes to a more pessimistic view of this “<span>progressive</span>” Arzner film than does Johnston. Suter sees the feminine voice in this film as having “<span>an organization of its own which is interwoven with/into the patriarchal</span>”.55 She goes on to note, however, that ultimately, “<span>because the feminine discourse is a part of the narrative structure and not ec-centric to it, it is liable to eventual usurpation by the meta-discourse</span>” (of realist narrative coherence).56 She suggests that an “<span>intervention into the patriarchal order by generating a text which foregrounds contradiction and by positioning the spectator in such a way that throws into question his/her voyeuristic relation to the image</span>” is necessary for a forceful expression of the feminine.57 Like Mulvey and Silverman, she implies that such contradiction must emerge out of alternative film practices. Unlike Mulvey, Suter does not despair of narrative itself as ontologically occlusive of the feminine: she cites Chantal Akerman’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jeanne Dielman</em> as an example of narrative that strongly articulates feminine discourse.</p>
        <p>Whereas Suter and Mulvey do conceive of the <em>possibility</em> of feminine subjectivity in classical cinema, Raymond Bellour’s groundbreaking work on enunciation in the films of Hitchcock suggests that the structuring work of the patriarchal forecloses the possibility of such an expression altogether.58 Bergstrom notes, with respect to Bellour’s work, a “<span>totalistic and deterministic . . . picture of the classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> . . . [of] a logically consistent, complete and closed system</span>”.59 Significantly, Bellour’s analyses heavily favor an image-centered elaboration of enunciatory structuration, one that looks to the gaze as <em>the</em> locus of subjectivity and power in film. As his vision-oriented understanding of identificatory processes neatly underwrites the enunciatory work he describes, in being driven by a (sadistic/voyeuristic) staving off of sexual difference by a male spectator prototype, he concludes that all classical Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> reworks Oedipal conflicts in order to contain/eliminate the (unbearable/castrated) figure of the woman.60 Bellour’s preferred <em>auteurs;</em> Hitchcock and Lang, however, while indisputably “<span>masters</span>” of teasing, luring, representing, and refracting the eye, were both enthusiastic pioneers in the development of a strongly dynamic use of sound. One need only think of the radical sound experiments of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blackmail</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">M</em>.61 On this count alone it seems that Bellour’s analyses of their films are only half-finished, or, at the very least, that they betray a familiar bias to the visual (and thus, according to his own logic, the masculine subject). When Bellour does account for the workings of sound, it is as a code, one “<span>present</span>” in the image or not.62 Where in relation to the image, innumerable such codes are devised for tracking the enunciatory progress of the film, sound (to quote Bellour’s own phraseology) comes off as “<span>obvious</span>”, a pure content, not meriting the meticulous subtleties that characterize his interest in the workings of image (angle, movement, composition, etc.). Rarely, for example, does Bellour ever draw attention to whether a sound or a voice emanates from on-screen or off, much less elaborate sound’s dynamic relationship to the image, its grain, the acoustic “<span>hierarchies</span>” established in the mix, etc. Rather, his analysis falls into a critical camp that looks at sound as little more than “<span>added value</span>” to an image that reigns supreme.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Effacing Effacement: Tracking the “<span>Other</span>” Axis of Enunciation</h3>
        <p>Despite Bellour’s lack of interest in sound’s or voice’s discursive functions in film, he does expressly link the subject of enunciation to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">speech</em>. He writes, “<span>The term ‘enunciator’ as I use it marks both the person who possesses the right of speech within the film, and the source (<em>instance</em>) toward which the series of representations is logically channeled back</span>”.63 Bellour’s understanding of “<span>the right of speech</span>”, in fact, seems ironically linked to the possession of the gaze in a film, and its relay from author to character and on to (male) spectator. He does not ever really explain this rather sudden and remarkable leap in his logic. (His conclusion is tautological, deriving from his assumption that the subject of desire is masculine and that the image determines enunciation in film.)64 If we displace his model onto speech and voice, it would seem, however, as logical to attribute “<span>the right of speech</span>” to a character bearing voice-off as it would to a character possessing the gaze—for the voice-off is a more than adequate “<span>marker</span>” of privileged speech.</p>
        <p>Doane and Silverman, in fact, note that there is always some self-referentiality to the voice-off. Silverman remarks that “<span>insofar as the voice-over asserts its independence from the visual track, it presents itself as an enunciator</span>”. 65 For Silverman, however, the degree of “<span>independence</span>” required is so stringent that few voices meet her criteria. The second half of her sentence, however, reminds us that part of the mark of the enunciator is its “<span>self-presentation</span>”, its drawing attention to itself. Many voices-off force their recognition on the viewer in this way. Doane adds to this the intriguing observation that, “<span>As soon as the sound is detached from its source, no longer anchored by a represented body, its potential work as a signifier is revealed. There is always something uncanny about a voice which emanates from a source outside the frame</span>”.66 Doane goes on to point to ways that voices are “<span>anchored</span>” against this “<span>uncanny</span>” signifying power, but the suggestion remains that even a voice coming from offscreen space (and not particularly “<span>coded</span>” as a “<span>voice-over</span>”) is noticeable in its difference from the image, marks an enunciatory potential.</p>
        <p>Provisionally, at least, one can conclude that a central narrating character may function as an enunciator, even in Bellour’s system, inasmuch as voice-off draws attention to itself as an act of enunciation (speech). The second definition of “<span>enunciator</span>” that Bellour provides, “<span>the source towards which the series of representations is logically channeled back</span>”, could, if we follow Bellour’s schema, represent the author (Hitchcock) or what he represents (patriarchal authority). However, this second “<span>enunciator</span>”, I argue, must also be defined as the desiring subject, a subject “<span>constructed by</span>” the “<span>first</span>” enunciator. If the “<span>first</span>” enunciator, then, possesses a right of speech “<span>marked</span>” as feminine (such as a highly “<span>visible</span>” female voice-off), then this second enunciator conceivably responds to the desire implicit in the discourse “<span>she/it</span>” expresses.</p>
        <p>Predictably, when one defines enunciation through images, all the “<span>enunciative loci</span>” Bellour describes conform to a masculine prototype. The mere postulate that sound works to construct an enunciator throws the tidy arrangement into disarray. All the assumptions that govern his argument, predicated on defining “<span>speech</span>” as “<span>look</span>”, begin to topple. There may be room, that is, within an enunciatory model that disrupts the “<span>pure</span>” visual paradigm (and along with it “<span>the holy Trinity</span>” of author, character, and spectator/subject brought together by the gaze) for feminine discourse, a feminine subject, desire of a different order. This desire, and the subject assumed through it, thus cannot be understood as relating to the visual axis of film alone, or even primarily. For, according to this model, sound/ voice/speech can also “<span>mark</span>” the character, her desire, and the subject who hears.</p>
        <p>One last look at Bellour’s understanding of enunciation is instructive in this regard—instructive, because he points to a strong contradiction at the heart of enunciation, one which rephrases, in a sense, the contradiction implicit in Foucault’s description of the formative structuration of discourse cited earlier. It is a double contradiction, as we shall see. After remarking on the strong structuring presence of the enunciator in the film systems he analyzes, Bellour recalls Metz’ distinction/collapse of story and discourse, and the effacement by which the fiction film conceals its own marks of enunciation. Bellour suggests that “<span> . . . this effacement . . . is precisely the means, at once subtle and powerful, whereby a very strongly marked process of enunciation manifests itself, which defines and structures a certain subject of desire</span>”.67 The bulk of his work stresses the apparent collusion of a strongly signified enunciator with a discourse that contains and effaces sexual difference/the feminine. But here Bellour’s argument suggests a simultaneous <em>effacement of effacement</em>. Bellour’s view of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> seems torn. On one hand, he privileges the (Hitchcockian) texts that foreground enunciation, enunciation of a discourse of containment. On the other hand, he claims the “<span>less extraordinary</span>” texts of classical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> efface the marks of enunciation (the marks that work to eradicate the feminine) and through this “<span>other</span>” effacement enunciate a certain “<span>subject of desire</span>”.68 Though it is clear Bellour himself does not entertain the possibility that this desire is anything but masculine, the question arises: if the masculine subject’s desire is at stake in the visual nexus of marked enunciation that Bellour describes, whose desire is at stake in the effacement of those markers? No matter what the answer (for I hardly wish to define feminine or masculine desire in this way), contradiction is at the heart of the process, a contradiction that speaks not simply of containment and coherence, but of the simultaneous activation of difference.</p>
        <p>Before turning to a more concrete explication of these ideas through a sustained examination of discursive paradox in <em>A Letter to Three Wives</em>, a final definition is in order. “<span>What</span>”, indeed, is feminine discourse? Suter describes discourse generally as “<span>an ideological position from which a subject ‘speaks’ (acts/interacts) with the social order</span>”: she defines the “<span>feminine</span>” part of the equation through her analysis, as <em>what differs</em>, in a sense, from the patriarchal.69 She looks for what she calls “<span>the feminine voice</span>”.70 Taking a different approach, this book does not accept, as a given, that patriarchy “<span>contains</span>” the feminine—that a “<span>meta-discourse</span>”, as Suter describes, always has the last word in classical cinema.71 Moreover, by focusing on sound (specifically the female voice-off), the analyses offered in this chapter offer a way to read “<span>against</span>” the woman’s “<span>iconic</span>” status within the image track. The female voice-off, as a feminine discourse, speaks beyond the character to which it is assigned in the diegesis— articulating the experience of other more visible, “<span>looked-at</span>” women in the text. Finally, though the question of voice (in its expression of nonspeech) remains vital, the problem of speech (as manifested and emphasized by voice-off) emerges as a crucial arena within which to approach a discussion of feminine discourse. These voices-off speak as represented “<span>women</span>”, articulate their/a desire, assume subjectivity, and seize power within the text. Their speech occurs in a discursive context—where language, knowledge, desire, and power intersect—a context, moreover, that the voice-off also helps to construct. There is no “<span>outside</span>” to “<span>inside</span>” relationship in discourse. To paraphrase Foucault, speech both manifests desire and is its object. Moreover, he warns, the “<span>danger spots</span>” (to the “<span>controlling</span>” features of discourse) are precisely “<span>those dealing with politics and sexuality</span>”.72 The female voice-off, enunciating the subjectivity of the “<span>objectified</span>” other in patriarchy, is dangerous indeed.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Complicit Consciousness: The “<span>Hailing</span>” of Other Women</h3>
        <p>The female voice-off thus not only “<span>draws attention to itself</span>” (to itself as both speech <em>and</em> as voice) but also evokes a source of enunciation. By “<span>hailing</span>” the spectator, the female voice-off differs notably from the image of the woman. Where, as Mulvey, Doane, Silverman, Bellour, and others have noted, the image of the woman “<span>exhibits</span>” itself as the <em>clandestine</em> object offered to a voyeur’s gaze, as “<span>passive</span>” spectacle, the female voice-off asserts itself quite openly as a subject. Not only does the female voice-off invariably take a first person stance toward the story/spectator, but, more often than not, it implicates the viewer in a “<span>direct-address</span>” relationship, invoking a discourse of “<span>speaking to</span>” as well as of “<span>speaking</span>”.73 The voiceoff of Addie Ross in Joseph Mankiewicz’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em> (1949), for example, opens the film by establishing a strong direct relationship to the spectator, reminding that, “<span>to begin with, any persons in this story might be fictitious—and any resemblance to you or me might be purely coincidental</span>”. Not only is Addie’s status as some kind of “<span>author</span>” implied here, but she refers directly to the viewer’s presence and implication within the “<span>story</span>” that is about to follow. Addie’s suggestion, in fact, that the viewer is <em>not</em> “<span>at stake</span>” here, is a joke: the voice-off points to itself <em>and</em> at the supposedly “<span>concealed</span>” voyeur, rather than effacing these discursive sites.74 Other examples abound of this implication of the spectator in the discourse of the film that “<span>is speaking</span>”.75 At the opening of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em>, Fontaine’s voice-off, like Addie’s, invokes the spectator, reminding, “<span><em>We</em> can never go back to Manderley again. . . </span>”. (She could also be speaking of all the other voices implicit in her own, as mentioned above.) In other films, the “<span>direct</span>”, inclusive quality of the female voice-off arrives via the spectator’s implied alliance with another character to whom the female voice-off is addressing itself in the diegesis, as, for example, when a letter is read (Lisa’s voice speaking “<span>to</span>” Stefan in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>); when imaginary conversations are held in her mind (Claudette Colbert’s “<span>talks</span>” with her absent husband in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Since You Went Away</em>); or when real conversations with interested diegetic “<span>audiences</span>” lead into confessions or stories of some kind (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildred Pierce, All This and Heaven, Too, Now Voyager</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">So Proudly We Hail</em>). Finally, the “<span>directness</span>” of the female voice-off is highlighted in other films by its representation as thought or consciousness eliciting the spectator’s recognition (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>).</p>
        <p>This vigorously marked “<span>subjective</span>” consciousness is also often foregrounded by the <em>kinds</em> of reflections the female voice-off shares with the viewer. They are nearly always rendered in a poetical, highly personal and affective speech, and frequently underwritten by “<span>subjective</span>” camera tropes. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">No Man of Her Own</em>, (Mitchell Leisen’s 1950 version) Barbara Stanwyck’s character introduces us to the town of “<span>Corfield</span>” in a direct address uncannily similar (on the image track) to that of Addie Ross (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>). In both films the camera simultaneously dollies in a highly stylized “<span>omniscient</span>” tracking movement down a small city’s streets to rest finally on an upper-class home—a home the female voice-off wishes were hers. (In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">No Man of Her Own</em>, Stanwyck lives in the house under a “<span>false</span>” identity, having pretended to be a dead man’s “<span>wife</span>”; in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>, Addie is describing the home of her childhood beau, Brad, a house usurped from Addie by Brad’s unexpected new wife, Deborah.) The omniscient camera, however, refracted through the voice, is not really the “<span>godlike</span>” view we would ascribe to it in isolation from sound: here, it “<span>speaks</span>” of a particular organizing consciousness, a subjectivity enounced most directly by the voice, a feminine desire (interestingly associated to the entitlement to occupy the house rather than to possess the man.)76</p>
        <p>The number of films with female voice-off that open in this way, in fact, suggest a kind of trope associated with female voice-off in general. In addition to the two films mentioned, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Since You Went Away</em> opens with a similar tracking in on the home accompanied by Colbert’s voice. Joan Crawford’s voice-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mildred Pierce</em> “<span>starts</span>” in just such a way, as we dissolve from the police station where she is giving her statement to end up at the modest home where she lives with her (soon to be estranged) husband. The heroine of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Walked with a Zombie</em> stares via a subjective tracking gaze through a grilled gate at her mysterious, seductive new home. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal</em>, the “<span>home</span>” that the opening voice-off leads us toward is, ironically, a prison. And, of course, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em>’s opening tracking shot/voice-off pairing, ending in the imagining of Manderley’s decay, is legendary. In addition to <em>underscoring</em> the enunciatory subjectivity of the voice (the dolly shot miming it on the image track), the linking of the female voice-off to a discourse of subjectivity related to the home, origins, class, and family is obvious. The female voice-off’s expressed <em>relationship</em> to this discourse is often a problem, in fact, that the narrative will take up: Mildred Pierce’s first home is too <em>modest</em> (for Joan Crawford), Colbert’s home is too <em>empty</em>, Brad and Deborah’s house <em>excludes</em> Addie (who was “<span>supposed</span>” to have been Brad’s wife), Manderley is a phantom paradise, always already lost.</p>
        <p>The problem, moreover, is revealed to the spectator as a kind of secret, a confidence entrusted to her by the female voice-off who shares her most personal inner thoughts. Thus, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">No Man of Her Own</em>, Stanwyck’s voice becomes increasingly “<span>subjective</span>” as we move from the streets into the house itself. Out on the quiet Corfield avenue, she describes, in lyrical tones, the general ambiance of the garden and house, “<span>the fragrance of the heliotropes . . . the dazzling white of the porch supports</span>”, and repeats that it is “<span>a pleasant life in Corfield</span>”. Then, shifting timbre, she confesses, “<span>But not for us, not for us</span>”, acknowledging the dark side of this tranquil world.77 Since the spectator does not yet know who “<span>us</span>” is, she is subtly hailed, implicated in this discourse. Inside the house, the voice continues over a mix of silence and music as we reach an inner room: Stanwyck sits on the couch “<span>thinking</span>” and looking at her husband pensively, a quiet aura of tragedy linking them. She tells us, “<span>I love him, and he loves me, I know he does</span>”, but she insists he will leave her before long. Then, in another subtle shift, she assumes direct discourse with him/us, saying, “<span><em>You</em> believed our love could save <em>us</em> . . . </span>”, etc. Thus, the spectator is hailed first as the recipient of a story (the indirect address outside the house) and also as a listening subject (direct discourse via a second character—her husband).</p>
        <p>Such shifting from one enunciative “<span>pole</span>” to another, moreover (from third person to first and back again in rhetorical fluctuations from “<span>narrating</span>” to “<span>stream of consciousness</span>” to “<span>imaginary conversation</span>” etc.), is typical of female voice-off. (Male voices-off more typically remain fairly “<span>consistent</span>” in the kind of enunciatory “<span>position</span>” the voice speaks [to and of]. In fact, a “<span>stream of consciousness</span>” is rarely employed in male voice-off—unless “<span>bracketed</span>” by a narrational “<span>distance</span>”, as is the case in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Murder My Sweet</em>.) We have observed the many fluctuations, positions, “<span>tenses</span>”—in short, enunciative powers taken up by Celia’s voice-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>. Similarly, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Now Voyager</em> (1942), Charlotte’s voiceoff, when describing her adolescent love affair to Dr. Jacquith, takes a narrating enunciatory stance of indirect past tense as we watch the flashback transpire. Later, after meeting Jerry on the boat, she gazes at her reflection in a window, her voice-off whispering her direct present tense inner thoughts, “<span> . . . <em>he</em> wishes [he understood me better]</span>”. The heroine of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal</em>, Pat, also bears a free-ranging voice-off—one minute describing “<span>extra-diegetically</span>” the tricks of fate that have conspired to rob her of the man she’s helped to escape from prison (and for whom she’s sacrificed everything), the next vocalizing her tortured inner thoughts <em>within</em> the diegesis.78 In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Brief Encounter</em>, Celia Johnson’s voice-off sweeps from a tortured inner monologue that serves to “<span>block out</span>” a gossipy woman’s chatter on the train to an imaginary “<span>conversation</span>” in which she tries to explain her love affair to her oblivious husband, who sits absorbed with his crossword puzzle. Frances Dee’s voice-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Walked with a Zombie</em>, too, drifts from a “<span>narrating third person</span>” to “<span>interior monologue</span>” and back again. (Other voices-off surface in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zombie</em>—male voices-off that serve to deepen her awareness of the racial tensions in the culture she now inhabits, and, further, audibly figure the contradictions her new consciousness brings into relief. These voices-off work not to “<span>replace</span>” her voice-off, but, in a condensation similar to that described in relation to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, represent extensions of her point of view that amplify a plurality of subjectivities.) This fluidity, this multiplicity, serves to highlight the process of enunciation itself: to draw out its vicissitudes, potentialities, powers. Moreover, this expressly mutable and plural discourse is that marked as a feminine discourse, expressly aligned with the female voiceoff. Feminine discourse is represented thus as enunciating more than one “<span>place</span>” for a subject, who “<span>speaks</span>” from many different positions in the text, elaborating multiple perspectives. This fluidity of subjectivity and plurality of enunciation should not be mistaken for what might seem to be its corollary on the image track—the “<span>omniscient subjectivity</span>” of a malecoded gaze that aligns with the mobile (and often “<span>overhead</span>”) camera and effortlessly transcends difference for an illusion of centrality and coherence. Rather, this “<span>vocal subject</span>” speaks <em>through</em> difference, enunciating a plurality of voices in one.</p>
        <p>One could, metaphorically speaking, “<span>read</span>” this discursive subject, as Michael Renov does, as “<span>possessing that grand skepticism [of the woman] . . . that makes of [the character of Pat in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal</em>] . . . the distant voice who speaks for both women [the two “<span>rivals</span>” for the man in the film], <em>for all women</em></span>”.79 Renov harkens this analogy back to Nietzsche and Derrida, in positing that “<span>woman is . . . constituted as a subject whose multiplicity of positions . . . produces a knowledge effect. . . </span>”.80 He claims, moreover, that the “<span>will-to-knowledge</span>” of the female character is “<span>most clearly expressed through her enunciative power</span>” (a power which he ascribes directly to her character’s possession and deployment of voiceoff). 81 Renov’s linking of a female voice-off to a will-to-knowledge and the enunciation of plurality (even though he does not mark out this aspect of his argument in terms of voice per se) provides several intriguing points of departure for a discussion of feminine discourse in films with female voice-off. The “<span>knowledge</span>” he describes compares strikingly with the paradoxical “<span>self-consciousness</span>” outlined earlier in this book, in that it allows for a recognition of self and other simultaneously—a recognition of self in the other. The question of desire, too, is implied in Renov’s description, for the knowledge arrives via the “<span>will</span>”. Pat’s character, like Celia’s in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret</em>, wants to understand the other, desires the truth that, even in its apparent obliteration of her as object of desire, allows her to take action, to be a subject through her sacrifice. Finally, there is the question of to whom and for whom this discourse speaks, the question of “<span>women</span>” at large. For although Renov does not exploit the metaphor he brings up earlier, in suggesting Pat “<span>speaks for all women</span>”, its repercussions are provocative. Is there a sense in which the female voice-off “<span>speaks</span>” to and for “<span>all women</span>”? Or, to rephrase his analogy, does the plurality of discursive positions enunciated by the female voice-off elaborate difference that can be sustained, affirmed, or even celebrated “<span>within</span>” patriarchal discourse itself? In an attempt to further tackle these questions, and with the hopes of elaborating more fully the relations of female voice-off to speech, desire and power, let us take a close look at <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>.</p>
        <p><h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Detached Attachment: The Ambivalent “<span>Author</span>”</h3>
        <p>As noted above, Addie Ross’s voice-off inaugurates the narrative of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>, her authorial prestige underscored by her claim to knowledge/ judgment. She claims, “<span>the name of the town isn’t important</span>”, stressing her ironic detachment as she sneers at “<span>plain Main Street</span>” and “<span>those horrible chain stores that breed like rabbits</span>”. These authorial markers are aggravated by her direct address to the spectator (“<span>any resemblance to you or me <em>might</em> be fictitious</span>”) and her haughty tone, as well as by the “<span>omniscient</span>” tracking shot described above. She both observes the images along with us and suggests that she is <em>producing</em> them (implying that she is the arbiter of what is or is not fiction). Addie Ross’s voice-off, in some respects, represents an anomaly of sorts in her strident striking of enunciatory power, with respect to the majority of other female voices-off in classic cinema. Her voice-off, that is, seems to lack all sincerity in its utter embrace of a cool, even cruel, ironic detachment, one that reminds of the noir male voices-off of any number of films. Unlike the caustic narrators of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Murder My Sweet</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Out of the Past</em>, however, Addie’s irony lacks any real humor or self-deprecation. This egotism makes her doubly villainous (an immodest woman—a scandal to patriarchy!) and her voice-off doubly interesting (for as we shall see, she also speaks <em>for</em> patriarchy). Her nearest counterpart in the voice-off world is probably Addison DeWitt in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve</em>. (Mankiewicz may be sneaking in a joke in giving them such similar first names, as if they’re two siblings from a singularly snobbish family.) Addie’s voice-off bears none of the fatalism inherent in most noirish evocations of sardonic voice-off. Rather than being subject to fate, she <em>is</em> Fate: she controls the narrative itself (or so it seems). Her irony would seem to give her, on one hand, a “<span>distance</span>” from the story that aligns her with the immunity of the patriarchal enunciator. But her sarcasm, paradoxically, simultaneously implies a lack of distance—for she is <em>too</em> ironic, not really detached from the scene she describes: she <em>hates</em>. Her sneering tone betrays an <em>interest</em> that renders her irony suspect. Part of this interest in fact, is explicitly ideological: her first target of disdain is none other than Smalltown, USA.</p>
        <p>Her scorn reaches Capitalism, too, embodied in the “<span>horrible</span>” chain stores that “<span>breed like rabbits</span>”. This metaphor “<span>speaks</span>” both of the polluting activity of mechanical reproduction (a strong thematic in the film’s denunciation of, among other things, the dissemination of popular culture via radio), and of reproduction itself. The second jab cuts both ways, “<span>against</span>” and “<span>for</span>” sex: “<span>women</span>” can be mapped onto “<span>rabbits</span>” as breeders cursed to have sex for biological purposes (one suspects Addie Ross has no children). This is a town where women are subjected to a biological role, something Addie explicitly critiques. (Addie is the first to “<span>speak</span>” of sex here, and, as we shall see, she actively castrates others for her own pleasure). Her attitude suggests that sex for biological purposes is repugnant, implying a preference for another, perhaps opposite purpose of sex for women—pleasure.</p>
        <p>But she swiftly moves on from a general disdain for the town to jeer the “<span>upper</span>” class. As the camera moves into the Bishop’s mansion, Addie reminisces, “<span>[Brad] gave me my first black eye . . . and my first kiss</span>”, her scornful tone giving way, for a moment, to wistful desire. That Addie’s desire entails both being beaten and being kissed is certainly telling: it introduces an ambivalence towards men that snakes through the film. It should be noted, moreover, that Addie’s “<span>ironic detachment</span>” falters at this statement. The discourse of romantic fatalism, implicit in her invocation of a shared past with Brad, is at odds with her declared disinterest in Smalltown and its inhabitants. No longer “<span>looking down</span>”, she is now “<span>looking in</span>”, and conveniently, the camera obliges by bringing us inside the house. What is inside, the image Addie’s desire conjures up, however, is not Brad. Addie’s attention here, enunciated doubly as the camera comes to rest on Deborah, and as Addie’s voice-off pronounces the word “<span>wife</span>”, is not on the character Deborah, but her <em>social</em> function, her marital relation. Addie’s desire is/was to “<span>be</span>” in Deborah’s place, the wife of Brad, rather than a desire for Brad himself. Coincidentally, this is also how Deborah appears to define herself (of the three “<span>wives</span>” she is the least independent and the most troubled about how to sustain her identity in the shadow of marriage). Most emphatically, however, Deborah’s image takes the place of the voice-off, which “<span>disappears</span>” after introducing her. Deborah is thus preliminarily “<span>marked</span>” as taking up enunciation in its wake.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The “<span>Model</span>” Woman: Internalizing the Enemy</h3>
        <p>Within the scene that plays out between Deborah and Brad, moreover, an identification of sorts is established between Deborah and Addie. Just as Addie desires to “<span>be</span>” where/what Deborah is, Deborah desires to be (like) Addie (as demonstrated in her obsessive envy).82 On one hand, Deborah is represented as Addie’s “<span>opposite</span>”: where Addie is “<span>sophisticated</span>” (we know it from her cultivated voice, and learn more about her “<span>exquisite taste</span>” later), Deborah is gauche (she does not know how to manipulate her own husband, for one thing). But the two women are also linked in important ways: they have the same dress (a reminder of her own non-uniqueness Deborah finds painful), they both “<span>want</span>” to be Brad’s wife, etc. Addie, moreover, is introduced here as an “<span>idea</span>” of femininity to which Deborah compares herself, an “<span>ideal</span>” to which she is held, and found lacking. She accuses Brad of “<span>setting her up</span>” against Addie, saying, “<span>Addie used to be a kind of ideal for you, didn’t she?</span>” When Brad rejoins, “<span>How did Addie get into this conversation?</span>” the discursive lines begin to come into focus. Most obviously, if Addie represents a “<span>paragon</span>” for the masculine subject, her voice-off must “<span>speak</span>”, on one level, for patriarchy. This alignment with patriarchal discourse explains her omnipresence (they can’t <em>not</em> talk about her) and her transparency—she is everywhere and nowhere. It also explains her threat. As the denizen of an ideology that seeks to control and contain women, she endangers the expression of feminine discourse, imperils feminine subjectivity.</p>
        <p>This preliminary enunciation of patriarchal discourse via Addie’s voiceoff, however, is already troubled, and contradictory.83 Addie, in introducing this scene, designates Deborah as her discursive emissary, not Brad, the male character bearing the gaze. Deborah is identified with the “<span>position</span>” of Addie, the enunciator. Despite the fact that they “<span>are</span>” different characters, Addie’s voice-off points to Deborah as the figure within the diegesis that will play out the desire she articulates. It is a desire also represented as ambivalence, expressed in the anxiety and fear that plague the wives as they reflect upon the triangular relationship between them, their husbands, and Addie. In this sense, Addie represents the “<span>internalization</span>” of the patriarchal ideal for the women in the story: she is the model of femininity that robs them of their subjecthood. Her voice-off, thus, functions as an expression of contradiction, enunciating the patriarchal discourse of suppressing the feminine <em>along with</em> a feminine discourse about the experience of being suppressed, and the contradictions of being a female subject within patriarchy.</p>
        <p>This process of internalization, this movement of the voice-off “<span>into</span>” the “<span>minds</span>” of the wives, a process by which the voice becomes “<span>their own</span>” inner voices (and yet, always the voice of another), is first stressed by the tracking shot into Deborah’s home as Addie’s voice-off slips from sardonic asides into desiring subjectivity. When the voice-off next emerges, it is explicitly associated with Deborah’s inner thoughts. Deborah, driving away from her house after the quarrel with Brad (a quarrel “<span>about</span>” Addie, but really about Deborah’s recognition that his desire entails her subjugation to an oppressive ideal), is deep in contemplation. Addie’s voice breaks in, as if watching the film with us, to comment, in a snotty voice, “<span>She won’t stay mad at him long. She’s too much in love. Pretty soon, she’ll be full of self-reproach. Women are so silly</span>”. Addie’s words function to underscore a patriarchal dismissal of a woman’s anger—reducing it to childishness and irrationality. But if we imagine for a moment that the voice-off here also represents an internalized feminine discourse, another meaning is expressed, one that is not “<span>buried</span>” but which is actually as clearly enunciated as the first. That is, the voice literally suggests that it is silly to be full of self-reproach and implies, moreover, that Deborah’s anger is justified, if untenable under the role assigned a woman “<span>in love</span>”. That the voice-off accompanies a close-up of Deborah’s face is not insignificant. It adds to our association of this voice with her thoughts, which we thus perceive as a contradiction. Deborah’s subjectivity enunciated in this way expresses both the patriarchal discourse and the feminine discourse that critiques and undercuts it. Neither discourse, moreover, “<span>dominates</span>” the scene, but a sympathy for Deborah is established that joins with the feminine discourse in countermanding the work of the patriarchal. Addie’s voice here is persecutory, and Deborah’s subjectivity profits from Addie’s loss. We find ourselves on Deborah’s “<span>side</span>”. (This “<span>preference</span>” for Deborah over Addie, however, means nothing in itself, as they enunciate contradiction <em>between</em> them. The subjectivity we attribute to Deborah is a function of Addie’s voice.) Finally, Addie’s enunciatory mobility is again emphasized, in that she is both producer of discourse and a spectator, “<span>watching</span>” Deborah. She thus “<span>collapses one of the divisions upon which classic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is predicated—the division . . . between the site of enunciation and that of spectatorship</span>”.84 Addie also “<span>posits an implicit reversibility between the positions of director and viewer, or speaking and spoken subjects</span>”.85 Addie functions here as a powerful reminder of the plurality of discourse and its many origins and expressions. The “<span>reversibility</span>” she brings into relief, moreover, triggers the spectator’s recognition of the apparatus, but not through the discomfiture of a look at the camera. Rather, it is as speaking subject that Addie thrusts the viewer into a self-aware “<span>place</span>” in the narrative. She is not only in control, but she flaunts it and points to her alliance with us offscreen.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Veiled Threats: The Secret Life of Men</h3>
        <p>Addie “<span>introduces</span>” the second “<span>wife</span>” of the second couple in the story: Rita and George Phipps—middle class, “<span>on their way up</span>”. Addie attributes the Phippses’ potential class mobility entirely to Rita’s ambition, foreshadowing the “<span>problem</span>” that will plague this couple (the emasculation of her husband through their role-reversal, and the success Rita desires and achieves). Subtly, at this moment, Addie’s voice-off also undergoes a “<span>shift</span>” to directly enounce Deborah’s inner thoughts, as she says, “<span>There she is now, ready, waiting, that’s Rita!</span>” Thus Addie’s voice-off, with characteristic fluidity, drifts from its narrating capacity to “<span>become</span>” Deborah’s “<span>internal monologue</span>” as she/they reflect(s) on the punctuality of this capable friend. As a later scene demonstrates as well, it is not in the least surprising that Deborah’s inner thoughts should “<span>sound</span>” like Addie Ross: deeply insecure, Deborah ruthlessly rails against her own inadequacies as a woman, set up against a standard Addie Ross represents.86 Addie’s voice thus comes to stand in for self-loathing of a very particular sort, one brought about by the internalization of an impossible conceptualization of the self as a flawless image. It is not accidental, in this sense, that Mankiewicz never shows us what Addie looks like—<em>no one</em> can look like Addie. (Maybe, as with Medusa, no one can look <em>at</em> her either.)</p>
        <p>Moreover, Deborah begins to <em>talk like</em> Addie when Rita gets in the car, wondering aloud why George is “<span>being so mysterious</span>”. Rita does not know what her friend is talking about until Deborah points out that George “<span>isn’t going fishing</span>” on his day off, and is wearing a blue suit. Like Addie, Deborah “<span>knows</span>” all about George and Rita and their daily life: she can predict their actions. But she also functions as an extension of Addie’s “<span>voice</span>” here in planting a seed of anxiety in Rita, who, coincidentally, has also had some sort of marital dispute that morning. As in the scene between Brad and Deborah earlier, an embedded question about male autonomy arises and is associated to the quarrels with an aura of mystery and vague threat. Neither Rita nor Deborah really knows where their husbands are going that day or why (Brad, like George, evades his wife’s questions on this subject). The comings and goings of the women, on the other hand, have been clearly mapped out (they are volunteers at a picnic with a nebulous group of picnicking “<span>kids</span>”). Thus, Deborah articulates a fear the women share—a nagging suspicion that, despite the bonds of marriage, their husbands are “<span>free</span>”, while they are not. She spreads a kind of contagion of anxiety, alerting Rita that her husband has “<span>another life</span>” of which she knows nothing. In this sense, then, the internalization of a feminine discourse that expresses a need for vigilance over a potentially straying mate becomes disseminated among the women characters. The root of this discourse, Addie’s voice-off, slides from offscreen to “<span>on</span>”, now reaching the level of “<span>ordinary</span>” dialog. Moreover, it is expressed like a community project, as one wife helping another keep an eye on her hubby.</p>
        <p>In the car, Rita admits that her time-consuming work for the radio has kept her from knowing what George is up to, but she defends herself by quoting Addie. She works for “<span>one hundred pieces of what Addie Ross calls the most restful shade of green in the world. Unquote</span>”. Deborah, sighing, wonders aloud why they always end up talking about Addie. Addie, apparently still eavesdropping from above, breaks in to answer Deborah’s question: “<span>Because maybe if you girls didn’t talk about me, you wouldn’t talk about anything at all. That’s right, I’m Addie. I’m the one they just can’t help talking about. My very dearest friends, too</span>”. This strange “<span>conversation</span>” continues as Deborah wonders if Addie knows “<span>how they feel about her</span>”. Addie replies, “<span>I know, believe me I do</span>”. The voice-off continues, “<span>But it doesn’t matter . . . as much as what all of you don’t know—yet</span>”.</p>
        <p>Addie’s voice-off clearly restates its enunciative privilege here, implying that they cannot talk without “<span>her</span>”. She is, in a sense, the “<span>subject</span>” of their conversations, of their speech itself. She is the drive behind what they express. Possessing the right of speech, she claims to possess the right of knowledge (she “<span>knows how they feel</span>”) as well as the right of power. Clearly, as we have seen, she is on the side of the “<span>author</span>”, in knowing “<span>more</span>” than the characters and speaking directly, here, to the audience by finally introducing herself. This introduction, of course, puts her more squarely in the diegesis than before: she is now a character, like the others. She enounces, moreover, the Gordian knot that this narrative will work to untangle; what is important is not what she knows, but what they do not know, what is hidden. She implies that in her all-powerful capacity, she knows what they do not, a suggestion underscored by her invisibility to the spectator, who attributes omniscience to noncorporeal beings. Yet, even as she enounces her power, she speaks her constraint. For, unlike some voices-off that reach the literal space of the character to whom it speaks (like Lisa’s in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>), Addie’s voice-off here is not heard by Rita and Deborah in this scene, only by us. Her lack of a body is both a form of power and a limit. And thus the question could be raised: if Addie has no body and no image, (or only the tiniest fragment of one), how can she possibly compete with women who do? If Addie poses a threat to them, it is, literally, as this voice—a voice enouncing the contradictory discourses that constitute the feminine in patriarchy, a voice that they internalize and experience as subjectivity. The body, in fact, is a battleground between these women, a privilege that gives the diegetic characters some advantages over Addie. Indeed, Lora Mae, the third “<span>wife</span>”, in particular capitalizes on her possession of specular leverage, as we shall see.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Bombshell: When a Woman Writes Desire</h3>
        <p>Lora Mae is brought into the story without the ceremonious introduction Addie has provided for everyone else, a departure from custom that marks Lora Mae as different. Seeing her at the ferry, Deborah (Addie’s designated driver within the film) “<span>names</span>” Lora Mae, who immediately brings up Addie’s “<span>disappearance</span>”. She declares sardonically, “<span>Addie left town this morning, for good</span>”. Though it is unthinkable (since <em>we</em> know how much Addie would hate it), apparently Addie was originally doomed to the kid’s picnic along with the other wives. The three women shrug off her absence as in-character (Addie is mysterious, secretive, like their husbands). When a letter suddenly arrives, “<span>special delivery</span>”, they raise their brows, then, despite Deborah’s sixth sense that whatever is in the note will ruin their day, they read it together—but not aloud or to each other. It is Addie’s voice-off that speaks the words on the page, with characteristic ironic relish. Her voice-off now serves as internal “<span>thought-voice</span>” for all three wives.87 The letter, moreover, is shown in closeup on the screen. An embossed linen paper bearing an elegant feminine script, the letter stands in for Addie’s body, imagined as “<span>perfect</span>”, beautiful, refined, etc. (and also repeats the opening title sequence, reminding of the extradiegetic). Along with her voice, thus, the letter re-inscribes her status as enunciator, the producer of discourse. Both image and sound track, that is, figure Addie as voice-off.</p>
        <p>This pivotal moment displays Addie’s power over them (she can “<span>take</span>” one of their husbands with her as a “<span>memento</span>”, a husband they apparently cannot control the same way). It also provides the hermeneutic that will drive the rest of the narrative (which husband?). In her representation of “<span>the voice of patriarchy</span>”, Addie presents her threat: one of the wives has been negligent and will be punished (lose her husband). But Addie’s voice also expresses an idea pretty disturbing for patriarchy as well: the men here are objects of exchange among the women, pawns in a catfight where the reward of victory is subjective power, rather than the man himself. (It is a somewhat “<span>patriarchal</span>” articulation of feminine discourse, to be sure, but reversing the usual subject/object relations between the sexes, at least.) This letter cuts both ways, displaying the discursive contradiction openly, “<span>speaking</span>” both the patriarchal agenda that will be played out as a kind of pleasure (the narrativization of bringing these uppity, postwar women down a peg, getting them to shape up and remember their place) and the feminine discourse that makes it possible and defies it (women have power over men, a fact Addie’s voice and letter brandish with glee), also for the sake of pleasure. (Where is the fun in bringing them down, that is, if their subjectivity is an idle threat?)</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dissolving Voices: Identity-in-the-Mix</h3>
        <p>The subjectivity of these women and the nature of their “<span>problem</span>” (ways they have been negligent wives and ways they have resisted objectification) in fact is the primary narrative and ideological concern of this film. When the voice-off next surfaces, it begins to blur the distinctions between “<span>Addie’s</span>” subjectivity and Deborah’s even more explicitly than before. The women, after casting a longing look at the telephone, the sole means of communicating with their husbands for the rest of the day, get on a boat with the kids, and sail to an island.88 Rita and Lora Mae pretend to shrug off their anxiety (try to pretend they do not hear the voice “<span>inside their heads</span>”: Addie who now speaks “<span>as</span>” their thought). Rita jokes, “<span>This is like some movie about a women’s prison</span>”.89 But Deborah, already established as the most paranoid of the three, and over-identified with Addie as we’ve seen, “<span>hears</span>” Addie’s voice taunting her. Another enunciatory shift thus takes place: where first, Addie spoke “<span>off</span>” as a narrator, then “<span>inhabited</span>” Deborah’s (and later the other wives’) thoughts, here Deborah seems to literally perceive the voice-off. It “<span>possesses her</span>”, or, as a character describes later relative to radio, “<span>she’s being penetrated</span>”. (The radio’s “<span>penetration</span>” is figured by the film to be an ideological act. As we have seen, in one respect, Addie’s voice-off possession functions the same way.) This vocal/auditory possession is, in fact, a typical trope of female voiceoff, especially in cases like this, where a hallucination of speech tortures a thinking subject.90 The line is blurred between thought and perception; we perceive that the character hears the voice as if it is <em>real</em>, not in her head. Addie speaks to her, asking directly, “<span>Do you remember your first Saturday in town? That was in May, too. Is it Brad? Is it Brad? Is it Brad?</span>” With each “<span>Is it Brad?</span>” however, Addie’s voice slips again, becomes less distinguishably her own: it begins, in fact, to sound more like Deborah’s voice, an effect highlighted by reverberation and an audio dissolve from Addie’s to Deborah’s voice. The voice is also “<span>echoed</span>” by the rhythmical sound of the boat chugging, as if the boat’s voice were also taunting, “<span>Is it Brad?</span>” (This is an auditory moment that seems highly “<span>self-reflexive</span>” in pointing to the mechanical reproduction of the apparatus through this distorted repetition, revealing, as the French would say, <em>le dispositif</em>.) The slippage “<span>from</span>” Addie “<span>to</span>” Deborah, however, is not clearly marked or audible: rather, the voice-off here gives a vague impression of being both women’s voices <em>simultaneously</em>. Addie’s voice-off, metamorphosed in this way, is also Deborah’s voice-off. Moreover, this voice-off introduces a flashback that tells us Deborah’s side of the story. Partly “<span>enounced</span>” by Addie, partly by Deborah, the flashback reflects (at least) two discourses. One could put it this way: Deborah “<span>within</span>” the flashback now represents that “<span>feminine discourse</span>” implicit in Addie’s voice. Her desires, speech, and difficulty “<span>being</span>” an image express her subjectivity, just as Addie’s voiceoff (in the role of patriarchy) subliminally continues to enounce a contradictory discourse, through <em>her</em> alliance with offscreen space.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Subjectivity Run Amok: The Impossibility of Being (an Image)</h3>
        <p>Deborah’s flashback, as mentioned earlier, relates her newlywed anxiety about meeting Brad’s upper-class friends. She drinks too many martinis, depressed about her hair and awful dress. Brad, a “<span>typical man</span>”, does not see what is the matter with her, but then neither does his gaze tell her she looks desirable. When Deborah meets Rita and George (a schoolteacher) they have just finished looking at her portrait on a mantlepiece: the conversation turns on her youthful prettiness. The discussion rotates to Addie (they <em>have</em> to talk about her), but this time Deborah preempts Addie’s domination of discourse; she makes her appearance, interrupts the talk. Her value as image is “<span>worth more</span>” in this scene than Addie’s (no longer heard) voice. But this moment also shows us where the patriarchal discourse now “<span>speaks</span>”: in Deborah’s body/image “<span>problem</span>”. Deborah, that is, speaks of the patriarchal place of woman (as image, she halts the narrative for a moment, makes us look at her). But she also speaks incessantly about the impossibility of being that image. She disrupts its “<span>goodobject</span>” status, shows us her paradox: she is actually <em>not</em> that image but an ungainly, obvious, subjectivity trying/failing to be it.</p>
        <p>This excessive subjectivity expresses itself in a number of ways throughout the flashback: her actions (she continues to drink like a fish, spills things, etc.), her speech (her voice slurs, she mispronounces the last name that is [not] her own, she says the wrong things), and, in a highly marked moment, her vision. In an emphatically “<span>subjective</span>” to-and-fro camera movement that blurs to mime her dizzy difficulty as she tries to dance with Brad, the film’s style departs from its usual “<span>realist</span>” objectivism and allies itself with Deborah alone.91 Subjectivity is “<span>localized</span>” with/in Deborah through optical devices that Doane suggests are not only privileged in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (as specific to it), but “<span>disrupt</span>” spatiotemporal continuity and “<span>initiate . . . a stylized violence against a unitary image</span>”.92 Although the narrative flow is in no way profoundly “<span>disrupted</span>” here, these dance-like zooms and blurs do represent a break from a “<span>unitary image</span>”. Thus Deborah’s subjectivity is strongly foregrounded as a subjectivity in trouble, a subjectivity under siege, a subjectivity blurred/distorted even within itself. (Subjected to the patriarchal, she cannot see straight.) It is a subjectivity, moreover, in competition with another subjectivity, that attributed to the seemingly invincible, ideal Addie Ross by her companions throughout the dinner.</p>
        <p>For Addie is still “<span>there</span>”, getting people to talk about her by sending a bottle of champagne.93 (Deborah, not “<span>woman enough</span>” to command full attention, will even have to share the toast with their “<span>absentee hostess</span>”.) Addie, aligned with the patriarchal and the “<span>objectifying</span>” image track here, seems to be the invisible (and Machiavellian) hand that plucks the garish flower frou-frou off Deborah’s dress, exposing the gaping hole in the fabric underneath. (Just when we see Deborah <em>see</em>, we also see that she is seen/castrated.) Addie’s discursive complexity still comes across in this scene: through Deborah, the subject of feminine discourse who “<span>plays out</span>” resistance to the patriarchal, <em>and</em> through her own “<span>invisible presence</span>”, rendered here both through her directorial machinations and her association to offscreen space. (George whistles at the champagne, as if at an offscreen “<span>babe</span>”—Addie, and Deborah and Brad both rise staring into offscreen space to try to catch a glimpse of her.)</p>
        <p>In fact, when Deborah emerges from the bathroom, having humiliated herself and Brad (or so, at least, she fears), she spies Brad talking to a woman we assume is Addie. The fragmented woman <em>par excellence</em>, Addie here “<span>is</span>” nothing more than an alluring shoulder blade and slender arm. We “<span>recognize</span>” her, moreover, from her voice, as she laughs, in her unmistakably affected tone, at something Brad has apparently said. This is the only moment when Addie inhabits the screen as image in the film. Addie never comes closer to being “<span>seen</span>” than at this moment—and there is a marked effort here to “<span>embody</span>” her thus as the object of the male gaze. (As competing image, indeed, the fragmented woman “<span>beats out</span>” Deborah: Brad never turns his rapt gaze from Addie’s shoulder to see Deborah’s return.) But this effort fails before it really begins, for even in her fragmented moment of objectified glory, Addie signifies her privilege in offscreen space, her knowledge of her feminine power, in her voice-off laugh. Heard through Deborah’s, our designated enunciator’s, ears, this is a laugh of triumph, the laugh of the subject who has beaten out the other woman and annexed the man (who is nothing more than a dupe). But Addie’s laugh also tells us that her subjectivity chooses self-objectification as its weapon. Not only does Addie’s body conform perfectly to the fragmented fetish, her laugh reflects an abdication of speech and refracts Brad’s subjectivity back to him. Our powerful voice-off plays to/with his ego. She not only laughs at what he says, but she says nothing herself. Interestingly, her voice, the laugh, speaks “<span>like</span>” an image—but <em>articulates</em> her silence, her silencing of herself. And so the vertiginous paradox created by two discourses continues indefatigably—Addie’s laugh representing her will-to-power and her will-to-powerlessness, the ideal of femininity that patriarchy demands Deborah to embody (and which she cannot), a powerful evocation of feminine desire and subjectivity that castrates and is castrated. Similarly, the establishment of her character as a “<span>mystery</span>”, a source of powerful mythology, both alludes to an elusive subjectivity that cannot be limited and named, and that is simultaneously and ceaselessly “<span>objectified</span>” though the others’ obsessive naming. The men deem her “<span>a class act</span>”, having “<span>the natural equipment of good taste</span>”, saying she’s “<span>generous to a fault</span>”, while the women echo, “<span>to a fault, that’s Addie</span>”, comparing her to a well-trussed car and pointing out her glaring lack (no husband).</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Listening to Static: Estranging Discourse</h3>
        <p>“<span>Rita’s</span>” flashback, in the second spiral of the film, is triggered by Deborah, who reminds her friend helpfully of George’s “<span>strange</span>” behavior that morning. Rita loses herself in thought, and a voice in her head asks, “<span>Why didn’t George go fishing? Why was George wearing the blue suit?</span>” The blurring of whose voice-off this is—Addie’s? Deborah’s? Rita’s?—is pronounced. It sounds like all three, vaguely. This indistinct voice is rendered bizarre, moreover, by its subjection to a soft, trumpet-like musical echo. It sounds like a distorted refraction of a voice rather than a voice pronounced directly, an impression aggravated by its lower tone overall and its loss of elocutionary distinctness. On one hand, then, Addie’s voice-off seems more distant here; she is less powerful than before, less subjectively present (we cannot even tell if this is her voice ringing in Rita’s head). On the other hand, Addie may be said to be more deeply internalized than before, for recognition is a form of distanciation, and differentiation. Moreover, the voice-off here <em>represents its own function</em> all the more clearly through this mutation: as a less “<span>pure</span>” signifier of Addie per se, it makes for a “<span>purer</span>” signifier of Addie as contradiction. One can read this voice, for example, as the patriarchal discourse hinting at the particular nature of Rita’s “<span>crime</span>” against George (which revolves around his preference for classical records over radiophonic reproduction).94 In this sense, the voice-off, too, still bears the stamp of Addie, who remembers George’s birthday, which Rita has forgotten, in her preoccupation with a “<span>pretentious</span>” dinner party meant to impress her boss. Addie’s gift this time is a record of classical music (a rare Brahms, very “<span>classy</span>”). The bugle sound, that is, foreshadows the dispute to follow, paves the way for the record that will cause marital discord. But one can also see the feminine discourse expressing itself in this scene, in the emphasis of the uncanny “<span>strangeness</span>” of the voice, its distortion, its inhabiting of Rita’s thoughts like a foreign body. This voice is both Rita’s and alien to her. The implication is strong, moreover, that the women are, in a sense, infecting one another with their own fear. Addie infects Deborah, who infects Rita, who will infect Lora Mae.95 As feminine discourse, the voice-off speaks of women’s self-subjugation, and the contagion of a discourse that pits them against each other instead of bringing them into solidarity.</p>
        <p>Radio is the interference in the marriage between Rita and George. Her writing, her production of discourse, puts her on the side of power (monetary and enunciatory) as <em>her</em> speech is disseminated and the language George represents (traditional literature, etc.) has been disempowered by popular culture’s embrace of the banal.96 (We do not really know what Rita writes, though, only that her boss keeps “<span>murdering her brain children</span>”.) Rita, however, actively expresses her desire to continue writing, and her sense of satisfaction at earning money is clear. George professes to be supportive of his wife’s new power, but the change in their roles causes ceaseless friction between them. At the climax of a heated argument between them, he shouts, “<span>I want my wife back!</span>”</p>
        <p>The film’s “<span>response</span>” to George’s complaint arrives with Addie’s gift, and a handwritten note attached to it. Addie’s voice-off reads (over George’s ecstatic face): “<span>If music be the food of love—play on! Addie</span>”. For the first time since the triggering of Deborah’s flashback, some twenty minutes earlier in the film, we hear our old friend’s voice clear as a bell, back in the driver’s seat. Again, her enunciative prerogative is marked on both the image and the sound track, and again she marshals a staging of a “<span>problem</span>” for the film to play out: marital discord for the Phippses. Both the present she sends (notably, a present of “<span>good</span>” sound as opposed to Rita’s “<span>trashy</span>” radio) and the suspicion she provokes (for Rita and for the spectator) jeopardize the precarious stability of their marriage. For Mrs. Manly breaks the precious disk, “<span>radio</span>” again symbolically ruining a good thing. Addie’s note speaks of “<span>love</span>”, a word of seduction, suggesting to Rita and to us that she may have designs on George. Addie’s discourse here again functions as a patriarchal “<span>reminder</span>” to Rita (to remember George, to put him first, to be “<span>womanly</span>”).97 But Addie also represents Rita’s assumption of discourse and all the “<span>love stories</span>” she writes, in that her production of a discourse of love is not convincing. Addie, as we know her from the film, has nothing to do with “<span>love</span>”: the note she writes is yet another bid for <em>power</em> over a man. So, too, is Rita’s writing equally cynical, an emblem of her power. Addie’s voice thus condenses the discursive contradiction between Rita and George, a struggle for the power of speech. It is a struggle in process, persistent (they are “<span>not speaking</span>” at the beginning of the film). When Rita brings up Addie as part of the problem, and George yells, “<span>Let’s try to keep Addie out of this</span>”, the two currents are clear. Rita knows that Addie (discourse) is the root of the problem, for Addie represents <em>Rita’s own desire</em>—a discursive power. George even complains that the influence of the discourse she has taken up (its “<span>drooling pap</span>”) has changed her from the “<span>independent woman . . . who once thought the same thing about everything</span>” as he does. And as George puts it, he does not want a female subject in the conversation or in the house: he wants a <em>wife</em>, an object.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Voice behind the Curtain: Uncovering the Sound of the “<span>Machine</span>”</h3>
        <p>The third spiral flashback “<span>belongs</span>” to Lora Mae and is marshaled into play by the “<span>troublemaking</span>” discursive power that has relayed from Addie to Deborah and now on to Rita. Rita finds Lora Mae in the locker room: she is the only one of the three women who thus far has “<span>resisted</span>” Addie’s voice and remained active all day—hiking, playing softball, etc. Just as Deborah needles Rita earlier, planting doubts and fears in her mind about George, now Rita works on Lora Mae, suggesting that now that Hollingsway is a corporate “<span>giant</span>”, he might go looking for some of that “<span>class</span>” he’s always admired in Addie Ross. But Lora Mae continues to “<span>resist</span>” the patriarchal message sifted down from Addie’s voice-off–<em>off</em>, declaring defiantly that she has “<span>got everything she wants</span>”. Rita, who “<span>sees through</span>” Lora Mae’s bravado, warns her friend, “<span>I think you’re just as worried as the rest of us</span>” (a strange phraseology that seems to include many more women than just Rita and Deborah). When Rita leaves, Lora Mae’s offhand air ruffles visibly in response to the distraction of a sound—a noise that has been subliminally present from the beginning of the scene but is brought up in the mix at this moment. We do not know yet what the sound is either, but it has a rhythmical, pattering, echoey tonality suggestive of water or tapping. The effect of the sound over her worried face is to highlight her isolation and to suggest that what she normally “<span>blots out</span>” becomes manifest to her consciousness in this moment of quiet solitude. In this way, the discrepancy becomes obvious (via the acoustic distraction) between what she says and what she really feels/thinks. Responding to her (and our) curiosity, the camera tilts down just past her body to reveal the source: water is dripping noisily from a leaky pipe under a faucet into a metal pail.</p>
        <p>Rick Altman has noted the “<span>tendency to move the camera to a sound, to point it at the area from which the sound is coming</span>”, and suggests that the impulse in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to “<span>locate</span>” the source of the sound derives from the “<span>question</span>” that sound poses. He claims, quoting Robert Bresson, that “<span>sound always evokes an image; an image never evokes a sound</span>”.98 He further contends that the “<span>source</span>” the image track provides is always a <em>lie</em> (sound and image, lying together about their unity, conceal their source[lessness]). But, in contrast to this assumption that the pan to the source of the sound responds to an effort to efface “<span>the truth</span>” of heterogeneity, the result of the camera movement and the tracing of sound’s “<span>source</span>” in this scene rather opens up and reveals “<span>the lie</span>”, and the difficulty of locating an <em>origin</em> (not just to sound, but to discourse, and to ideology).</p>
        <p>Cutting back from the faucet to a tighter shot of Lora Mae’s face, we see her expression grow increasingly grave, as if she is only now fully “<span>internalizing</span>” the threat behind Rita’s words. At this moment, Addie’s voice-off emerges, but again somewhat indistinctly, suggesting (like a hypnotist), “<span>Maybe you haven’t got everything you wanted after all</span>”.99 Reverse shot to the pail, from Lora Mae’s point of view, with an added “<span>subjective</span>” impetus: the camera dollies in to the dripping water. Simultaneously, the sound of the water begins to metamorphose Addie’s voice, rendering it “<span>through</span>” the echoey sound of the pail. Within seconds, very little, if any, vestige of “<span>human-ness</span>” remains in the strange chanting/dripping voice-off here, and even less “<span>female-ness</span>”.100 Rather, like a robot mechanically repeating his master’s command, the voice-off here implies simultaneously that it comes from “<span>within</span>” Lora Mae’s mind, <em>and</em> that this voice is not her own.</p>
        <p>Thus, as this scene progresses, the “<span>question</span>” of <em>source</em> becomes quite complex. Lora Mae (and the spectator), having pinpointed the source of the dripping, seems to identify it next as the source of another sound that “<span>follows</span>”, Addie’s voice. (The water comes first and Addie’s voice seems to emerge in response to what it suggests.) She thus identifies the “<span>origin</span>” of Addie’s voice “<span>in</span>” the dripping water, only to next perceive that the voice and the drops are “<span>one</span>” in a machine-like distortion. She seems, that is, to be casting about for the source of the <em>question the sound raises</em>, rather than the actual sound, for clearly Addie’s voice does not “<span>come from</span>” the faucet. Rather, it was always already there—she just did not pay attention to it before. In this sense, Lora Mae’s sudden awareness of the dripping also underscores the listening subject’s own funneling of sounds in “<span>real life</span>”, where he or she pays attention to only those sounds that seem “<span>important</span>”. In a film, as Alan Williams has pointed out, such discretionary, focusing tasks are taken up by the recordist, mixer, director, etc.101 Still the idea is represented: this character suddenly perceives “<span>background</span>” noise as foregrounded sound. The film works moreover to emphasize her and our recognition of this transition in value as a shift in consciousness. Lora Mae, that is, “<span>hears herself hearing</span>”. This moment suggests her recognition that the sound/question involves distortion and mediation, two processes brought out by the crazy effects placed on the sound/voice and the represented idea that the voice in her head emerges <em>under pressure</em>, much like water leaks from this unreliable pipe. It is Addie’s voice—but also <em>not</em> “<span>Addie’s</span>”, in that now its patriarchal tenor is rendered obvious: part “<span>male</span>”, part “<span>machine</span>”, part “<span>nature</span>”, this is the voice of Ideology, which subliminally encourages her to doubt herself.</p>
        <p>This is a moment, perhaps, when <em>histoire</em> grows quiet, in which <em>discours</em>’s whisper can be “<span>heard</span>” more clearly.102 The “<span>strangeness</span>” of this voice keeps it at a remove from Lora Mae’s subjectivity. That is, though this voice is clearly “<span>in Lora Mae’s head</span>”, we hear that it is alien to her, strangely Other. When it addresses her as “<span>you</span>”, it enounces a certain separation rather than suggesting that she is “<span>talking to herself</span>”. At the same time, the voice opens onto Lora Mae’s subjectivity in interesting ways. It speaks directly of and to Lora Mae’s desire, implying that she is <em>not</em> satisfied, that she does <em>not</em> have “<span>everything</span>”, that she <em>wants more</em>. It in fact encourages her to desire, to stir up and trouble the marriage contract she has finessed, to make a demand. In this respect, it differs markedly from the voices-off that lead into Rita’s and Deborah’s flashbacks, which speak much more directly to internalized anxiety about the loss of their mate to a rival. Lora Mae’s “<span>anxiety</span>” here reaches far beyond Hollingsway; in fact, in another contrast to the other voice-off flashbacks, her husband’s name is not even mentioned. We do not, as yet, know “<span>what</span>” she wants; for the “<span>problem</span>” is not enounced in terms of a plaguing question about her husband’s “<span>secret</span>” subjectivity. If Lora Mae has a problem, it has to do with her own dissatisfaction, rather than her husband’s. The implication arises that Hollingsway has not given her what <em>she</em> wants. Indeed, though the contrary “<span>message</span>” also comes through (she’ll lose her husband because he does not know she loves him), the film strongly suggests here that it is Hollingsway who may lose Lora Mae. The “<span>responsibility</span>” for Addie’s interference (in her role of patriarchal marriage counselor) in this case rests on the male subject’s failure to please, rather than the woman’s. Lora Mae’s “<span>story</span>” thus becomes privileged in the narrative in a number of ways; not only is she the most superficially “<span>resistant</span>” to Addie, but her subjectivity is foregrounded as a problem the film will explore. Her subjectivity, her desire, and her contentment in marriage, this time, are at issue, rather than the man’s. In fact, this voice sets up and leads into the longest flashback of the film, wherein Lora Mae’s desires are traced, culminating in her calculated seduction of Hollingsway.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Demanding Body: Routing the Image</h3>
        <p>We already know a great deal about this couple from the other flashbacks, in which salient features of their unhappy marriage emerge. Lora Mae and Hollingsway have communication problems: they disparage each other openly, and they particularly try to control or criticize each other’s speech. Hollingsway, for example, repeatedly tells Lora Mae to “<span>shut up</span>” (she ignores him), and Lora Mae routinely dismisses whatever he says as the unreliable excesses of a drunk (he ignores her). In this final “<span>example</span>” of marriage, then, the story takes us beyond the pale of Deborah’s emergent recognition of disappointment marring her idealistic dream, and Rita’s more jaundiced, but still chastened, efforts to break the mold of traditional sex roles. Here is no pretense of romantic love, no ideological illusion to soften the reality of a sexual and social contract that both parties accept for their own, apparently cynical, reasons. Here too is the emergence of a discourse that equates frank speech with “<span>truth</span>”, only to later recast such “<span>truth</span>” as a distortion that keeps the couple from harmonious communication.</p>
        <p>Lora Mae, a working class girl, lives literally “<span>on the wrong side of the tracks</span>” (as emphasized by the locomotive that rolls by and shakes the crummy apartment she shares with her bingo-playing mom and shrill sister). Hollingsway, her boss, is represented as higher class by virtue of income (which is why she wants to land him). But, importantly, the social distance between them collapses because of the similarity of the way they speak. Both use the direct, straight-shooting type of language associated with “<span>lower class</span>” standing in the cinema, in contrast to both other couples. Thus, their “<span>common language</span>” stresses, despite their constant bickering, a good fit. But the trouble between them also relates to their speech: they are too frank, too direct. They do not know how to lie convincingly enough to believe the lies themselves, how to use the language where the man proposes and the woman pretends not to demand a proposal in return. Unlike the more stable couples in the film, these two know their marriage is based on a “<span>lie</span>” that is too much the truth to sustain within bourgeois marital self-representation: Hollingsway and Lora Mae have struck a bargain.</p>
        <p>Lora Mae tells him early on that she has “<span>definite ideas</span>” (no sex without the price tag—marriage). Later, spying Addie’s picture in a silver frame on Hollingsway’s piano, she lets him know that’s “<span>where</span>” she wants to be. A stereotyped commitment-phobe, Hollingsway won’t bite, but she traps him, using her body as bait, “<span>playing</span>” the woman in the photograph, the ideal object of desire. Not only does she exploit her sexual power selfconsciously, she manipulates him very obviously, manipulation being the point of her actions in the film—and the spectator is alerted to her finesse in controlling the signs of corporeal and imagistic seduction.</p>
        <p>There is a strong argument to be made in this film for performative resistance against her own specularity, as Lora Mae “<span>pretends</span>” to be an unconscious object of the gaze, tearing her stocking so as to lift her leg up for Hollingsway to view, assuming the facial “<span>inscrutability</span>” of a pouting model as she waits “<span>helplessly</span>” for him to light her cigarette, arranging her cleavage for him to inadvertently spy, etc. But despite her success in ultimately lassoing Hollingsway, in a sense, Lora Mae renders “<span>the image of woman</span>” too well, too aggressively to be “<span>contained</span>” in the silver frame she claims to want to inhabit. For one thing, she uses not only her image but also her body, her “<span>sexiness</span>”—and the explicit weight of her body keeps her from attaining the abstraction that Addie symbolizes here. Lora Mae, that is, fails as miserably as Deborah does to “<span>be</span>” Addie Ross, but in Lora Mae’s case the failure comes from a too parodic and <em>self-conscious</em> simulation of the ideal, that, refracted as a mirror image to the male subject’s gaze, “<span>ruins</span>” the artlessness of (his) desire. She will not let Hollingsway retain an illusory image of her; rather, she “<span>shows off</span>” her object status at every turn. Lora Mae “<span>fails</span>” because her subjectivity expresses itself as she works to lure the male eye, because <em>she</em> has control over her body and her “<span>sexiness</span>” rather than the man; moreover, she <em>flaunts</em> her control. Thus, whereas earlier Addie’s voice-off laugh gives Brad center stage, stroking his ego but without letting him in on the secret, Lora Mae’s imitations of the “<span>self-effacing</span>” woman fall flat: Hollingsway <em>knows</em> she’s snowing him. Likewise, when she feigns “<span>ladylike</span>” behavior out of keeping with her class upbringing and natural disposition (most noticeably in an affected tone of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">voice</em>), she seeks not to “<span>be like Addie</span>” or the upperclass (as Deborah and Rita did) but to control Hollingsway, to make him treat her with respect, and to <em>make</em> him desire her. Like Addie, then, Lora Mae is something of a director here, an actor/director who uses her body as her “<span>instrument</span>”, “<span>representing</span>” herself as a desirable woman and dictating the man’s desire.</p>
        <p>This “<span>weightedness</span>” of Lora Mae’s image is truly fascinating for the complex discursivity it introduces into the film. It is almost a given in feminist analyses of film to interpret excessive embodiment as a sign of a woman’s objectification: Lora Mae, however, in deploying her body through this film, <em>resists</em> the objectification that Addie Ross (on one level) represents. Lora Mae’s body is her weapon here (and not, perhaps, a surprising weapon for a woman seeking to determine her own destiny within a patriarchal system). As body, then, and as image, within this flashback, Lora Mae successfully “<span>routs</span>” Addie Ross, the idealized absent One, overpowering the attractive abstraction of the photo on the piano, edging Addie out of Hollingsway’s life with her more concrete, more powerful sexual bait.103 Lora Mae also nudges Addie out of the narrative itself. Addie, in her “<span>patriarchal</span>” function as perfect image/ideal–absent woman operates only feebly in this flashback overall: though she is discussed by Hollingsway and Lora Mae at various points, they do not argue “<span>about</span>” her, as the other couples do.104 She comes up only to have Lora Mae “<span>distract</span>” Hollingsway away from her. In the restaurant, where Addie supposedly is offscreen somewhere, Lora Mae easily brings the conversation and the gaze back to her by asking for a cigarette. (This discursive realignment, centering the problem of desire back onto her despite Addie’s offscreen “<span>power</span>”, is even noticed by Hollingsway. In fashion typical of this atypical couple, he acknowledges that Lora Mae is smart, underscoring once again their mutual recognition of her discursive power. Her distraction here thus differs markedly from the diversion of the gaze that Deborah poses earlier to Addie’s picture, in that Lora Mae’s is calculated, not coincidental.) Later, looking at Addie’s portrait on the piano (we see it only from behind), Lora Mae again displaces the offscreen abstract image by virtue of her concrete physicality. That is, Hollingsway is not attracted to the photograph, but to Lora Mae—obviously so, by virtue of his disappointment when she again rebuffs his advances. But, like Deborah and Rita, Lora Mae here is also <em>caught up</em> by the “<span>idea</span>” that Addie represents—this time, not just an ideal appealing to a man, but an ideal appealing to <em>her</em>, expressed here as “<span>being in a frame</span>”. Naturally, there is an effort on the part of patriarchal discourse to get Hollingsway and Lora Mae married, to get Lora Mae to wish to be the idealized safe (and bodiless) woman “<span>owned</span>” by the man (an object decorating his home/piano). But once again, “<span>Addie</span>” is a contradictory discourse: whereas the photograph speaks of the male subject’s fixation on an absent, ideal woman, it speaks simultaneously of the woman’s desire to have power, independence, and entitlement, “<span>to be in a silver frame on her <em>own</em> piano in her <em>own</em> house</span>”.</p>
        <p>She desires thus <em>not</em> to be “<span>like</span>” Addie, since Addie’s photograph, for one thing, is not on Addie’s own piano in Addie’s own house. (If she desires to be anyone, it would seem she desires to be Deborah, who does preside on her own piano in a framed photograph.) In fact, Lora Mae’s desire here is remarkably discursive. She demands—and the demand is what Hollingsway objects to (he has been married before, after all). Addie (the photograph), on the contrary, has not demanded anything, is “<span>content</span>” to let her image reign (“<span>like a queen</span>”) in his living room for a year. Lora Mae’s insistent kiss after delivering Hollingsway her ultimatum, then, is the “<span>price tag</span>” he speaks of later; he can “<span>own</span>” her and get such kisses for free, if he will cede to her demand. Thus Hollingsway joins George as something of a kept man, for he does give in, capitulate, acknowledge that the woman runs the show. His proposal, singularly unromantic, signals his discursive struggle with her here. Saying, “<span>You win, I’ll marry you</span>”, he admits defeat. In a shot of the back of her head that can only be described as Godardian, we wait for Lora Mae’s response: as she turns, so does the power dynamic. For in getting “<span>what she wanted</span>”, Lora Mae does not “<span>get what she wanted after all</span>”: him <em>wanting</em> to marry her, rather than merely consenting. Lora Mae wants to be the subject, to make demands, but she also wants the “<span>romantic</span>” privilege of a cherished object. Their discursive tango continues: with the next line, Hollingsway makes a new bid for power, re-representing her control as his: “<span>You’ve made a good deal, Lora Mae</span>”. Thus, where the image has failed to objectify her, her own desire, misfiring, turns her into a piece of merchandise. The flip side, of course, is that if Lora Mae has made a “<span>deal</span>”, so has Hollingsway—she’s bought him. They seal their transaction with a kiss, but the problem of their marriage, unlike the others’, needs no further explication through the elaboration of a specific quarrel.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Discursive Lessons: The Diva’s Empowerment</h3>
        <p>Only Lora Mae’s flashback “<span>returns</span>” to the present without benefit of voice-off “<span>accompaniment</span>”, again marking her as different in some way from the other wives. Their interior “<span>defense</span>” completed, the three women return home to learn their fate. George is waiting for Rita, who, as noted before, now volunteers to assert herself to Mrs. Manley, in accord with her husband’s preferences. Significantly, however, she does not give up her job, just refuses to work on the weekend. As cinematic capitulations to patriarchy go, Rita’s seems tolerable; she retains her discursive potential, even if she does now sit in her husband’s lap. Deborah, however, returns home to find a message left by a “<span>lady</span>” for Brad. A closeup of the note shows feminine writing, and Addie’s voice-off murmurs in Deborah’s ear, “<span>Mrs. Bishop’s husband called to say, he is very sorry. He will not be home tonight</span>”.105 The resurgence of Addie’s voice here reminds us of her special “<span>rapport</span>” with Deborah, whose internal thoughts sound like the woman she envies/desires. That she hears Addie’s voice-off this way, unencumbered by the machine-like distortions that make the voice’s patriarchal agenda more explicit, tells us that where the other wives recognize, to an extent, the insidious “<span>otherness</span>” of Addie’s discourse, Deborah still has a long way to go. Still, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">spectator</em> recognizes this voice as contradictory, as both Addie’s and Deborah’s voice-off. In fact, the voice-off here acts as a red herring, encouraging us to think Brad has indeed run off with the ubiquitous Other Woman. Addie is back on the side of the director, but this time, instead of telling us how to interpret the image and involving us in snobbish complicity, she tricks us.</p>
        <p>When the film makes full circle and returns us to another country club dance, the discursive work of the narrative gels. A contradictory discourse reigns here, speaking both of patriarchy’s fantasy of compliant women who “<span>wake up</span>” to save the institution of marriage just in time, and also of the fantasies and fears of women positioned as subjects within the story. Rita, as we have seen, has compromised to save her marriage, but so has her husband. This couple now again represents the stable “<span>median</span>” of the middle class, used to bearing both contradiction and compromise. Rita, moreover, “<span>emulates</span>” Addie here, when, coming off the dance floor, she reprises Addie’s voice-off laugh to stroke her husband’s ego. As with all imitations of Addie’s discursive power, this one cuts both ways: as a sign of the internalization of a patriarchal lesson on “<span>how to be a good wife</span>”, and as a sign of cynical and self-reflexive representation of self-objectification designed to placate a male (who is none the wiser and misreads himself as the subject).</p>
        <p>Lora Mae and Hollingsway have, on the other hand, reached a crisis point. Their marriage seems threatened, not from without, but from within, because of their inability to declare “<span>love</span>” rather than “<span>war</span>”. Oddly enough, the wealthiest couple in the group—and simultaneously the most “<span>working class</span>”—Lora Mae and Hollingsway have not yet made the transition from practicality to romance that patriarchy’s view of marriage would seem to demand. As they straddle two classes, they also straddle two views of sex roles. The film implies that they must now finally choose both class alliance and the ideology that goes with it. Hollingsway’s “<span>confession</span>” to Deborah sets the wheels in motion. But the final solution requires Lora Mae to redefine her desire, to articulate that when she said she wanted marriage, she really wanted the man. (Coincidentally, this redefinition allows for a collapse between the marriage and the man, which previously were marked as distinct, and radically so.) But this compromise, significantly, only comes about through a highly charged moment wherein Lora Mae’s subjectivity is called upon to pronounce itself. Hollingsway, after admitting that he was the one who “<span>ran away with Addie Ross</span>”, lets her know she now has all the power; she can fleece him if she wants. Lora Mae responds by telling him, “<span>I stopped listening. Because if you said something, I just didn’t hear it</span>”. Consistent with this couple, the problem turns on discourse—and also on the nature of the “<span>truth</span>”. In this moment, Lora Mae embraces dissimulation, something she has formerly rendered problematic, either by dissimulating too “<span>obviously</span>” or by refusing to play the game the usual way. She thus falls in line with the other wives (lying to keep the man, to keep the peace; “<span>pretending</span>” in order to sustain the fiction of a happy marriage). But she also refigures herself as a listening subject, one who can choose what to hear and what to block out. Paradoxically, she has the last word and uses it to position herself as a subject who cannot/will not hear (the truth). She relinquishes, moreover, the power she has held throughout the film: the power of to extract a price, a sacrifice rendered in the service of a discourse of give and take, wherein “<span>love is a compromise</span>”. Lora Mae’s subjective choice may be said to be “<span>directed</span>” at placating women with unfaithful husbands, women in rocky marriages, women who feel unloved “<span>for themselves</span>”. However, her gesture here, and her vocal declaration of her desire, also articulates a possibility of realigning (this) marriage as something beyond the social contract that has resulted in their mutual objectification and entrapment, refiguring it as a freely willed interdependence. For in this moment, Lora Mae finally gets what she says she really wants earlier in the film—not marriage per se, but a man who “<span>wants to marry her more than anything in the world</span>”. Her desire to be desired finally “<span>comes true</span>” only when she admits to her own desire—when she accepts the burden of subjectivity. Where earlier, her subjectivity “<span>expressed itself</span>” through her miming of feminine objectification, in this scene, she enounces the riskier project of declaring reciprocity.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic transformation, however, involves Deborah, who, as opposed to the “<span>first</span>” dance, now curbs her excesses (no martinis), behaves like a “<span>lady</span>”, dresses perfectly, bears her husband’s absence with stoicism. Within the span of the film, Deborah has “<span>learned</span>” to conduct herself according to the internalized standard of Addie Ross with graceful good taste. She’s grown up—more independent—questioning George’s paternalistic suggestion that she not attend the party without her husband. Deborah has also learned to speak, thanks to Addie. In the wake of the narrative, we now understand that she identifies no longer with her husband, or with herself as “<span>wife</span>”, but with Addie: the absence of Brad in this scene underscores her affiliation with the unmarried “<span>independent</span>” voice-off (whose dress, coincidentally, she wears). She speaks of Brad, moreover, as if he were dead, referring to him as “<span>the body under the table</span>”: for all narrative purposes, indeed, he has been cast out, buried. His absence foregrounds and perhaps abets her new discursive confidence. For once, Deborah seems whole. Where earlier she only speaks to please and tries to efface herself (failing), she now talks bluntly, expressing her annoyance when George tries to get her to medicate her bad mood with champagne. She even fires a crack at his pretentious use of language, and later, when he tries to interrupt her, ignores him altogether. Moreover, she takes it upon herself to finish “<span>Addie’s</span>” work here, mediating between Lora Mae and Hollingsway. Sitting alone with Hollingsway, she sneers at his self-pitying attitude, mocking him openly. Whereas in the opening of the film, Hollingsway is the (somewhat dubious) voice of knowledge, telling Deborah about Brad’s relationship with Addie, this time Deborah gives Hollingsway a piece of her mind, pointing out his stupidity to him (in not knowing Lora Mae loves him).106 She also, against the advice of the others, blurts out the “<span>truth</span>” about Brad and Addie to Hollingsway: as she does so her enunciatory position is heavily underscored. Over the protestations of her friends, she insists on speaking, declaring, “<span>I want to say it out loud</span>”. The film cuts to a close up, and Deborah shifts her eyeline deliberately and slowly to look straight in the camera—and then she says, with divalike melodrama, “<span>My husband’s run away with Addie Ross</span>”.107</p>
        <p>In this marked appeal to the spectator, Deborah’s alignment with Addie and all other Absent Ones is clear: she articulates not only her discursive subjectivity, but designates that what she says carries beyond the diegetic space into a social space. In this social sense, Deborah speaks to “<span>all the women out there</span>”, the postwar spectators who may also be struggling with the specter of Addie Ross, as signifier of the contradictory discursive position of the woman in patriarchy.108 Important, too, is that Deborah is “<span>wrong</span>”: the truth is that she only <em>imagines</em> her husband to be with Addie Ross or to prefer Addie to Deborah. This fantasy seems suggested by the film as both something of a nightmare for women (an anxiety that patriarchy fosters to keep them in line) and a secret thrill (in that Addie also represents a woman’s discursive power). (Given how well she takes Brad’s absence, leads one to wonder, in fact, if the fantasy of freedom from the husband is not another discourse circulating here.) Deborah’s announcement, made to the audience as well as to the diegetic circle her friends make here, acknowledges her identification with Addie, her sense of being a subject, speaking aloud what is taboo. It also heralds the sense in which she has been “<span>chosen</span>”—<em>she</em>, after all, is thereby held up, “<span>exposed</span>” as the secret, all-important rival, Addie’s real object of desire (we know Addie’s appetite for their husbands betrays her envy of the women and hence her desire to be like <em>them</em>). Deborah, in fact, seems to be enjoying her moment of despair. After her dramatic announcement, she rises, imploring theatrically, “<span>Please, nobody get up</span>”, as if they might rise to their feet and applaud. Deborah’s pain here provides an opportunity for her to perform, to express her suffering, and to relish the centrality that tragedy bestows upon her character. Although she is relieved of her burden by Hollingsway, who confesses to the crime (and thereby gets the accolades Deborah half expected), Deborah’s discursive position in this film has nonetheless undergone a remarkable renaissance. Whereas the others are (to an extent) realigned with matrimony, she finishes the film without the requisite textual confirmation of reconciliation with Brad, leaving the others to dance while she walks happily off alone, returning to offscreen space, Addie’s domain.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Circulating, Effervescent Excess: The Up-ending of Closure</h3>
        <p>Indeed, Addie makes one final “<span>appearance</span>” in the film. Hollingsway and Lora Mae rise to dance with each other, signaling the rebirth of their courtship. A lilting “<span>cha cha cha</span>” picks up on the sound track, and the camera tilts down and moves in to their now-empty table, coming to rest on a champagne goblet. The goblet tips, suspended at an angle for a moment before toppling over and breaking audibly. Addie’s voice-off emerges, like the mistress of ceremonies, her tone cheerful, philosophical: “<span>Heigh ho! Good night, everybody</span>”. Whereas Karen Hollinger sees this final remark as expressing Addie’s “<span>disdain for the three wives and their dedication to their marriages</span>”, this is surely the least openly contemptuous remark “<span>Addie</span>” has made in the course of the film.109 In fact, Addie’s words here operate quite ambiguously (one can well imagine what the snide “<span>husband stealer</span>” <em>might</em> have said about the turn of events). We can interpret this enigmatic finish a number of ways. It restores Addie to omniscience (she is realigned with the spectator in privileged communication) and to supernatural power (the glass seems felled by her invisible hand).110 Of course, her farewell (to “<span>everybody</span>”) cannot but implicate the audience offscreen as well as her diegetic “<span>friends</span>”: thus in the last moments she wrests authorial credit for the story that has played out. Above all, this odd moment, this seemingly gratuitous flourish of voice-off, reminds us that Addie is “<span>there</span>”, watching, but also telling. Retroactively, it seems she must have always “<span>known</span>” that the story would end this way, since she is telling it. Addie, that is, knows that within such a story (a narrative with sympathetic female characters made in 1940s Hollywood), she must be foiled: the happy ending had to happen (just as the spectator knows/knew all along.) Thus the toppled goblet reminds not only of her power, but of her excess. She “<span>authors</span>” this story, but she is also its “<span>trouble</span>”, the spilled champagne, the broken glass that triggers a narrative. She is the woman “<span>outside</span>” representation about whom film speaks with pleasure and fascination. The glass topples, and, one senses, her “<span>work</span>” is done, she can move on to other films. Addie’s desire, which opens the film, here refuses to “<span>end</span>” it, adamantly rejecting closure on a certain level, reminding of her excess. Her tenacious repossession of discursive power in these final frames also re-articulates the discursive contradiction that drives this narrative over all. The contradiction, however, should not be understood as simply a difference posed by irony in the voice-off that presents “<span>Addie’s detached independence</span>” as opposed to a second “<span>female perspective . . . of the devoted wives</span>”.111 Rather, even within Addie’s voice-off, discursive contradiction surfaces, pointing simultaneously to a patriarchal agenda to keep women in line, to inspire their recognition of the price they will pay for producing discourse and expressing subjective desire, <em>while also</em> speaking clearly and forcefully of those same taboo desires, powers, and subjective expression. The female voice-off in this film points obviously to how discursive contradiction “<span>works</span>” within representational forms produced under patriarchy, to express conflicting truths, paradoxical subjectivities, sustained differences. Such contradiction does not confine itself to films bearing female voice-off but, rather, may be more vigorously foregrounded there for us to perceive. In these films, such contradiction is often “<span>the problem</span>” the narrative seeks to speak, and in speaking, enounces and affirms. Thus, as Hollinger suggests, the spectator’s identification “<span>is split</span>” in a wavering between patriarchy and feminism that opens up for the female spectator “<span>the space of a reading</span>”, because films with voice-off lead “<span>to a recognition of the social problems underlying [the] contradictions . . . inherent in [the] roles</span>” (of female characters in the woman’s film).112 Hollinger’s points are well-taken, though perhaps overly cautious. I see no reason, for example, why a male spectator could not “<span>read</span>” the film as the female spectator does. The work of the voice-off does more than “<span>prevent absolute closure around what might appear . . . an entirely regressive social message</span>”.113 Rather, the discursive contradiction is pervasive and expresses different discourses simultaneously, speaking of both male and female subjectivity within the contradictory discursive field that is patriarchy.</p>
        <p>Charged with dynamic contradiction, reversals, and paradoxes, and shuttling between “<span>embodiment</span>” and “<span>disembodiment</span>” relative to and within the diegesis, then, the voice-off in this film exhibits a remarkable discursive mobility and fluidity, as do the voices-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, as we have seen. The problem of speech, of feminine discourse, is raised by the female voice-off visibly, but not to be “<span>identified</span>” with it as the sole bearer of feminine subjectivity (if safely “<span>detached</span>” from the corrupting influence of a female body). Rather, the female voice-off floats and transforms, displays the heterogeneity inherent to the voice and to discourse itself. The subjectivity brought up by the female voice-off cannot be contained even within that voice—hence the many permutations of voice-off, and explications of subjectivity that emerge within the rhetorical relationship of sound to image that such a voice inspires. The flashback structure in this film, rather than folding in and containing the feminine, “<span>anchoring</span>” it to image, instead problematizes the contradiction of voice to image in figuring subjectivity and enunciation. As we have seen, it is even possible for a female character “<span>with</span>” a body to speak her desire more powerfully than the voice-off. The question of whether Addie’s most powerfully subjective moments of enunciative expression occur when she is most “<span>authoritatively</span>” disembodied or structured as “<span>outside</span>” the diegesis, in fact, remains a lively issue. In a film wherein female subjectivity has so much at stake, perhaps, the clearest evocations of female desire and subjectivity come at moments where the distant authoritative “<span>side</span>” of the voice-off is rendered problematic, exposed as something “<span>other</span>”. We cannot conflate enunciation with ideology, that is, and if we seek to understand how women speak, and how their subjectivity is rendered, the heterogeneous flux the female voice-off seems to represent in films bearing this discursive trope offers an audible testimony to speaking difference.</p>
