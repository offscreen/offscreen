        <p>Say I am you.</p>

        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Disappearing Voice: Tracing a Silenced Point of View</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, the woman screams. This moment, full of terror, unseeing and unseen horrors, is reserved for a female voice, a voice that seems to have reached some sort of apogee. The scream reaches us, usually, from offscreen space, as a manifestation of female voice-off. It is difficult, in fact, to remember any film in which a man screams. A certain form of crisis indeed seems “<span>best</span>” expressed or represented by the female voice raised in an inarticulate cry, a sound that Kaja Silverman claims the Hollywood film is “<span>at the greatest pains to extract.</span>”1 The female cry/scream represents, frequently, a body’s (impending) mutilation, and, subsequently, the female character’s subjective disappearance from the film text. This association (terror/disappearance) takes varied manifestations—and it often links characters as it powerfully halts the narrative to highlight the reverberation, tone, and affect of the scream. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cat People</em>, for example, the character of Alice becomes trapped in a dark swimming pool, “<span>surrounded</span>” by ominous growls of some supernatural killer “<span>panther.</span>” Dog-paddling frantically in the center of the pool, her figure dwarfed within the wide-angle framing, Alice screams—but her screams do not belong to her.</p>
        <p>Wrested from synch by the reverberations of the aquatic space, the surreal feline shrieks link her voice to the voice of the “<span>cat</span>” that similarly distorts and echoes—and by extension to the character of Irina, whom we suspect to be the “<span>real</span>” monster. We (barely) see Alice in the water, but it is Irina’s “<span>disappearance</span>” from view that is underscored as the narrative pauses to dwell on the terrible voice that ricochets through the dark. A moment of terror for Alice, it is also a moment of power for Irina—stressed by her location in offscreen space, allowing us to imagine that she has transformed from a tentative, neurotic young wife into a jealous, violent beast capable of destroying its rival. This scream is shared by the two women; it is uncertain who emits the sound, or whether the scream is a response or demand. It is unclear whether the scream expresses Alice, recognizing her peril, Irina, triumphant in her malevolence, or indeed, the “<span>cat,</span>” about to strike (or stricken itself): all of these possibilities resonate in this drawn-out, bloodcurdling, sonic representation. The scream foregrounds the female voice as a site of crisis, and the narrative is held up while we are held captive to sound. The scream moves vertically against the linear flow—arresting time and expanding it—focusing our attention on a battle between subjectivities, ultimately implying their convergence, their simultaneous expression. Of course, the narrative of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cat People</em> overall is obsessed with the paradox of “<span>being</span>” two entities at once—ostensibly both a cat and a woman. The beauty of this film, its subtlety, lies in its refusal to separate Irina into two halves—or to let us “<span>see</span>” that she really “<span>is</span>” a cat. Rather she embodies heterogeneity—the desire and the power of the <em>between</em>.</p>
        <p>The scream marks a moment of heterogeneous subjectivity, a moment that the text dwells upon with eruptive insistence. The scream traverses between subjects—allowing a “<span>disappearing</span>” subject to speak despite apparent elision from the text. In a famous sequence from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">M</em>, a series of shots represent the little girl Elsie’s murder. The sound of her mother’s cry, “<span>Elsie!</span>” over “<span>empty</span>” images (images significantly represented as such, to a great degree by their contraposed silence) finally fades away over an image of Elsie’s ball rolling out of the bushes, and the little girl’s tethered, torn balloon. Christian Metz has pointed out a simultaneous metaphorical and metonymic signification of Elsie’s body in the use of the ball and balloon, and Thierry Kuntzel has noted how the “<span>presence of [the mother’s] voice . . . lets . . . another person’s absence [Elsie’s] be read.</span>”2 What Kuntzel leaves unarticulated in his discussion of the final frame of the sequence, in dwelling on the simultaneous designation of Elsie’s body and the murderer’s desire, is how silence, in “<span>replacing</span>” and articulating the mother’s voice, also represents Elsie’s unheard scream. For it is partly the silence that makes the balloon appear, like Elsie, so “<span>pathetic</span>” (as Metz so eloquently notes) as it too is mutilated noiselessly. Thus, like the mother’s voice-off, Elsie’s repressed voice/cry is strangely echoed in the silence here: metaphorically (the voice that is stilled), metonymically (silent as her objects—an object, now, like them), and psychically (if the cry is the child’s first expression of life, the umbilical connection to the mother, silence represents the death drive, a “<span>silencing of the drives</span>” themselves, as Michel Poizat puts it. Poizat cites Lacan to clarify: “<span> . . . the cry is first of all not a call, but it makes silence emerge [<em class="notranslate" translate="no">surgir</em>]. It is not that the cry is supported by a silence which is its base, but the opposite</span>”).3 The silence in this scene is “<span>supported</span>” by a cry inaudible but present. This scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">M</em> articulates a triangular connection between the scream/cry, offscreen space (linked to voice-off), and silence. Silence, that is, is never “<span>nothing</span>” (film recordists understand this better than anyone—silence must be created, laid down). Silence has a presence, and should not always be associated to “<span>the void,</span>” especially when it is marked as filling in for a sound we imagine (a much more terrible cry, in Elsie’s case, than any recorded sound could ever be). As Poizat’s remarks imply, the voice and silence are engaged in a dynamic dialectic: in silence, paradoxically, we can “<span>sense</span>” the voice rather than hear it. Thus Elsie’s voice, her subjectivity, does not go <em>unheard</em> in this scene; rather, it is perceived powerfully as silence—a silence into which both her and the mother’s voice “<span>disappear</span>” and through which both “<span>speak.</span>”</p>
        <p>The peculiar shared subjectivity implicit in the scream is something we shall return to later in this chapter with respect to a critical transition point in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>—a moment that articulates and highlights a shift of possession of voice-off privilege from the main female character (Celia) to the main male protagonist (Mark). This moment constitutes, among other things, an apparently brutal suppression of Celia’s point of view, which “<span>disappears</span>” along with her voice-off. Where many critics see this supplacement as a repression of the female protagonist’s subjectivity in favor of the male protagonist,4 such transfers in voice-off, in elaborating a shift in perspective, do not necessarily elide an originary perspective. As <em class="notranslate" translate="no">M</em> illustrates, a character who has disappeared, who is “<span>silent,</span>” may yet be heard. It is not enough to point out that a character has lost her audible voice-off to conclude that she also been deprived of her power to transmute her point of view. We cannot simply assume that point of view “<span>belongs</span>” with or to the character who is speaking, at the cost and suppression of the subjectivity expressed by a character who has ceased to speak.</p>
        <p>Yet, undeniably, possession of voice-off in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> does imbue the character speaking with a privileged point of view. It not only suggests that this character has a perspective to which the spectator is privy, but it offers the protagonist a pronounced “<span>subjectivity</span>” within the narrative. When one character dominates in possessing sole access to voice-off within the film, such as is the case in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>, her or his point of view is thus underscored, made emphatic and of central interest. But what of films in which more than one voice-off compete for the privileged “<span>place</span>” of subjectivity? In these films, the possession of voice-off emerges as unreliable, marking point of view as potentially contradictory, polyvalent, in conflict. Moreover, when plural voices-off surface in the course of a film, the shift seems to take place at the expense of the female protagonist. The female is granted voice-off only to lose it halfway through the film, her voice-off is “<span>buried</span>” deep within the web of the narrative, or her voice-off is replaced by the voice-off of a male character.</p>
        <p>The majority of 1940s films bearing female voice-off, in fact, are characterized by such “<span>shifts,</span>” by multiple voices-off, or a female voice-off that “<span>disappears.</span>” <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve, The Enchanted Cottage, The Locket</em> (male and female), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca, I Walked with a Zombie, So Proudly We Hail</em> (disappearing female), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives</em>, (multiple female), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">No Man of Her Own</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Two Mrs. Carrolls</em> (sporadic female) all share this inconsistent voice-off, giving rise, as we shall see, to an understanding of perspective that may include the perspective of another—a heterogeneous point of view.5 In exploring this alternate reading, the expressive uses to which the female voice-off is put relative to male voice-off are crucial. As mentioned earlier, a certain “<span>kind</span>” of language typically (in classical Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>) distinguishes female from male voice-off—“<span>poetic</span>” vs. a more “<span>transparent prose</span>”. (One should not misunderstand such tendencies as demonstrating that certain types of voice are essentially “<span>male</span>” or “<span>female</span>”—the emotional, poetic thought-voices of the anonymous male soldiers in Terrence Malick’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Thin Red Line</em>, for example, break with such conventions.) The context within which these voices-off are often set, narratively and formally, as well as the rhetorical values (“<span>irony</span>” vs. “<span>sincerity,</span>” for example) which underpin them are also key considerations in linking character voice-off, a representation of consciousness and point of view. Point of view as suggested by possession (or “<span>dispossession</span>”) of voice-off also necessarily involves the question of sexual difference and the representation of gendered subjectivity and power relations within such texts, leading to a number of questions. Can point of view be simply asserted as adhering to the sex of the character bearing voice-off? Is it possible to conceive of, for instance, a male voice-off that is “<span>coded</span>” as feminine? Are there deadlock point of view wars waging in these films? Can a suppressed voice still “<span>speak</span>”? Finally, what conclusions can be drawn about the description of perspective implied by the image relative to the point of view suggested by the voice-off? Does the image always prevail over sound, as so many theorists have suggested, especially in pinning down or containing the female character within her status as looked-at/ objectified image?</p>
        <p>The textual relations between the protagonists within a rhetoric of sound to image must be carefully considered in interpreting the representation of perspective in a film. This rhetoric might also be described as a complex narrating process, wherein sound and image, and representations of “<span>listening,</span>” “<span>speaking,</span>” “<span>being seen,</span>” and “<span>seeing</span>” interplay to produce a recognition of point of view that enables the spectator to negotiate difference (rather than to repress it). Seen thus, point of view emerges as a complex construct brought together through the cognitive processing of narrative schema by the spectator as he or she thinks through the text.6 Certainly, moreover, the formal specificity of voice-off offers a range of expressive relations between voice and image in a film, a varying alliance to the visible and to the imaginary that evolves along the temporal span of the film. A film that employs (in Doane’s terms) a “<span>voice-over</span>” may be said to exploit the perspectival ambiguities of a voice emanating from off screen space in a particularly charged fashion. The symbolic presence of offscreen space, in such a case (even the seemingly “<span>ordinary</span>” sounds attributed to it) is overdetermined, reflecting a representational logic that the “<span>voice-over</span>” inaugurates and constructs throughout the film text. This “<span>logic,</span>” a consistency to the manner in which the text relates offscreen space, symbolically, to visible space, is played out not only on the level of “<span>voice-over</span>” but also when that same voice (or other voices in the film) arrive from diegetic offscreen (Doane’s “<span>voice-off</span>”). When, for example, one “<span>voice-over</span>” gives way mid-film to another, offscreen space and the orienting perspective have already been aligned with the first voice. This originary point of view inflects our reading of the voice-off and perspective that come to “<span>replace</span>” it. The female voice-off is strikingly unstable, in fact, constantly mutating, shifting, slipping, and transgressing both “<span>bodily</span>” and textual boundaries. The logic that associates an originary radically asynchronous voice to other voices into which it transmogrifies enhances the spectator’s sensitivity to fluctuations between voice and body, on-screen and offscreen sound, and multiple points of view. The perspective inaugurated, ultimately, is one of fluidity and multiplicity rather than a single vantage point or “<span>point of audition.</span>”7 The heterogeneity of such a perspective is aggravated by the apperception of a consciousness through voice-off, a recognition that elaborates point of view as a kind of “<span>middle voice.</span>” That is, the convergence of more than one voice-off and the representation of more than one consciousness lead not only to a multiplicity of perspectives, but these points of view exist in a paradoxical relation that allows for such difference to be expressed actively throughout the text.</p>
        <p>Although sound and voice are often considered significant elements that affect our reading of a narrative and the expression of character point of view therein, they are more frequently viewed as cosmetic appendixes to the more primary constructing power of image and diegesis. But the contribution of voice and sound to the articulation of point of view “<span>of</span>” a text or character, in fact, is anything but secondary. To the degree that sound emphasizes offscreen space (both the diegetic imaginary space we imagine conjoins the image track and the nonvisual register of space that sound evokes), its constructive contribution seems amplified. Noël Burch has demonstrated how, in offscreen space, a dialectic of difference is continually present to the image, a difference rendered acute through formal emphasis on asynchronous sound.8 This persistent alterity relates importantly to our apprehension of perspective throughout the film. Underscored by the pronounced “<span>difference</span>” of voice-off within the text, point of view, to a significant degree, is “<span>determined</span>” on the level of the sound track through its often radical disruption of what the image relays. Voiceoff leads the spectator to recognize character consciousness as at odds with the image, to “<span>see</span>” beyond or through the visual register of the film, to perceive a point of view that is constructed “<span> . . . on <em>the difference between</em> the opaqueness of visual appearances and the report of the depth of feeling of the interior world.</span>”9 That is, in many ways and in many films—among these, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>—hearing “<span>trumps</span>” seeing. It is not that the image track ceases to signify, leaving the voice-off alone to evoke point of view. Rather, voice-off participates in the structuration of point of view, establishing a strongly present perceptual framework at the onset of the film and evolving during the course of the narrative into a powerful representation of a “<span>middle voice</span>” between characters.</p>
        <p>The dynamic view taken here of the transformative operations of the voice-off is sparked by the logic that underlies Edward Branigan’s understanding of narration itself as, “<span> . . . not just a structure but as a process . . . where[in] two narrations cease to be perceived as simply a mixture of separate features but instead become a blend with entirely new properties able to generate entirely new effects.</span>”10 Where Branigan is concerned with how (and how many) different “<span>levels of narration</span>” interact to produce meaning, my analysis in this chapter maps the principle behind his analysis onto one of these specific levels—point of view—with an eye to uncovering its processes. It is in some respects difficult to elaborate character point of view as such, abstracting its “<span>role</span>” in the play of a text from the other levels. I aim, while concentrating my discussion on point of view, to respect the complexity from which it emerges, tracing a nonvisible structuring signification—a voice-off—as it signifies apart from (or, more accurately, <em>alongside</em>) the visible image—its frame, angle of view, mise-en-scène, lighting, etc. Point of view, in this sense, emerges <em>between</em> the voice-off and the image: it relates crucially to the spectator’s apprehension of characters as consciousnesses and the degree to which they express, represent, and elicit recognition of perception and subjectivity. This “<span>between-ness,</span>” indeed, comes out strongly in films bearing female voice-off. The female voice-off signals the heterogeneity of point of view, rendering it audible. Films that explore the repercussions of such a voice, moreover, represent such heterogeneity as a sustained, rather than foreclosed, difference.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The “<span>Chattering Wife</span>”: The “<span>Place</span>” of Voice</h3>
        <p>Eric Smoodin suggests that the “<span>voice-over . . . narrator is not the ‘author,’ [but] seems nonetheless to be the organizing force behind [the film’s selection and ordering of images],</span>” adding that “<span>the equation of image to narrator’s speech has become so conventionalized . . . that even after the spoken narration has vanished from the sound-track, the spectator still <em>feels</em> the narrator’s presence and <em>senses</em> the narrator’s control over the story.</span>”11 Smoodin’s evocation of the spectator’s visceral apperception of the lingering presence (a physical manifestation?) of an absent yet structuring point of view resonates with a revelatory contradiction. On one hand, his description implies that the voice (and the words it pronounces) is conflated with the image, rendered doubly invisible, so to speak, in that we see “<span>through it,</span>” perceiving the visual register as the primary signifier of point of view. On the other hand, the image has become a ruse, a mirage. It is “<span>controlled</span>” by what is absent, inscribed in a perspective that is sensed (intuitively) rather than seen. Voice-over works as a structuring absence, masquerading as transparency.12 Or, perhaps more precisely, it offers a structuring contradiction, a meaning lent by paradox.</p>
        <p>In layman’s terms, Smoodin’s point is obvious: the spectator takes what has come before into account as he or she follows the film’s narrative. One’s perception of point of view is constructed <em>in time</em>, through a process that, in Smoodin’s description, seems progressive, complicating. Moving from the implications his statement holds for the spectator to how it may bear on the workings of the text, however, another important consideration arises. Smoodin’s statement suggests that image does not necessarily dominate sound, even when that sound is not present “<span>on</span>” screen. Smoodin’s description implicitly inverts the dictum that image comes “<span>first</span>” and sound “<span>after,</span>” along with the ideological primacy accorded to the visual register that implicitly guides much of the work done in film studies. Metz’s infamous adage that sound is like a “<span>chattering wife,</span>” stems from what Sarah Kozloff has described as a kind of theoretical and critical “<span>revolt</span>” staged by many major film theorists, against what she calls “<span>iconophobia.</span>”13 This critique of sound stems from a political and aesthetic interest in dislodging the centering logos of the word. In a searing analogy, Kozloff alludes to the bizarre underpinnings of this “<span>faith in the image</span>” as fittingly dominant over sound: “<span> . . . the image is cast as the husband/father and the sound track as the wife/mother. The proper power relationship is made abundantly clear.</span>”14 Strikingly counterintuitive (for, generally, in film theory, the feminine is invariably associated to the image, where, it is suggested, she can never speak, but only signify her difference), Kozloff’s description fascinates me by pinpointing a subliminally “<span>feminine</span>” affect to sound in general (one we might assume that comes across even more glaringly in a voice that is expressly coded as female).15 This affect might also account for early theorists’ phobic rejection of sound’s contagion of the image, its rendering impure the (Apollonian, masculine) visual signification. 16 (The female voice-off, in this light, represents a highly “<span>contagious</span>” sound indeed.) Kaja Silverman, perhaps seeing such contagion as a weapon, has posited female voice-off as a feminist interventionist tool for destabilizing the male-centered image (in films made by women). I would carry the idea further: the alterity of sound is a perpetual and illuminating “<span>trouble</span>” for the stability of the subject’s <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>, even in films constructed without the bent of a feminist author’s intentions. There is something misleading, however, in the vocabulary used here for illustrative purposes—in suggesting that the image’s meaning is “<span>there,</span>” uninflected, prior to being “<span>troubled</span>” by sound. Rather, in their dialectic, their difference produces the meaning. To sum up: sound and image work off each other—neither, in a sense, can escape the signifying effect the other brings, once they are connected as a relation.</p>
        <p>A tired adage warns that voice-over narration is a redundant “<span>literary device</span>” and/or a lazy last-ditch solution to make a badly constructed screenplay comprehensible in the final mix. This cliché is belied not only by the intricacy such voices often lend narrative structure but by the perspectival subtlety they promote. Kozloff has persuasively illustrated the complexity of voice-over narration, mapping out the different configurations the voice-over can assume relative to the diegesis. Throughout her book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Invisible Storytellers</em>, moreover, she points to two expressive tendencies “<span>attached</span>” to the use of voice-over. The first is an ironic distanciation, as in voice-overs that slyly pull the rug out from the image or undercut narrative events in some way. (Voice-overs can also make the viewer conscious of the unreliability of voice-over itself.) The second lies in its frequent invitation to identify with the character with whom it is associated, and “<span>the voice’s power to create a feeling of connection and intimacy.</span>”17 Kozloff sees voice-over films as “<span>hybrids,</span>”18 where these two seemingly contradictory modes of expression—distanciation and identification—coexist peacefully. Kozloff herself does not expand on the nature of such “<span>hybridity</span>” to explain, for example, to what degree these qualities co-exist within single films, to what degree they are properties of narratological strategies, or to what degree they are properties of voice-off per se. The path she leaves untraveled presents an important conceptual direction for this book. This chapter traces the implications of “<span>hybrid</span>” texts wherein the deployment of voice-off allows for the simultaneous articulation of heterogeneous, seemingly incompatible perspectives within the film text. With an agenda to topple the usual hierarchy imposed in film studies, where image figures an originary perspective and sound merely inflects or recontextualizes what visual information decrees for character and point of view, let us turn to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Levels of Narration: Multiplicity and Voice</h3>
        <p>An uneasy example of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">film noir, Secret beyond the Door</em> does, nonetheless, bear what Christine Gledhill calls a “<span>typical plot</span>” of this genre—“<span>a struggle between different voices for control over the telling of the story,</span>”19 or, as J. P. Telotte puts it, “<span>a fight for the right to speak.</span>”20 As discussed earlier, many films made during the ’40s bear witness to the political and discursive struggles between men and women during this era.21 But the notion of a discursive “<span>fight</span>” can also be taken quite literally in certain films, in which more than one character vies for the powerful position of offscreen narrator—the governing consciousness through which the viewer identifies a point of view. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, an abrupt and disorienting shift in voice-off occurs midway through the film: the main female character’s (Celia’s) narration gives way to her husband Mark’s spoken thoughts. To what degree does this shift alter the spectator’s understanding of point of view? If the voice-over always “<span> . . . testifies to a subjectivity at work, an ‘I,’</span>”22 what happens when more than one subjectivity surfaces during the course of the film? Does one character’s point of view simply cede way for that which comes to replace it? Or must the spectator, faced with a number of subjective viewpoints, “<span>abandon all notion of an objective vantage or . . . possibility of ever synthesizing [the] multiple perspectives,</span>” as Telotte warns?23</p>
        <p>Multiple points of view need not predispose the narrative to a kind of narratological chaos. The spectator always negotiates complexity as he or she engages with a film. The discernment of character point of view directly relates to our reading of narrative, our alignment with discourse, and our (and the film’s) imbrication in and resistance to ideology. Understanding how character point of view is constructed, then, in a dynamic sense—as one level of a textual process—is fundamental if we are eventually to grasp the complex intersections of character/text, author, spectator, and culture. Branigan, for example, has separated out eight “<span>levels</span>” of narration in his study of narrative film: what I refer to here as “<span>character point of view,</span>” would, under his taxonomy, be associable to the lower half of his pyramid, the levels of “<span>focalization</span>” attached in some way to characters’ experience and consciousness. Branigan’s dismantling of narrative levels is brilliant and extremely helpful in many ways, but it is also dizzying in its compartmentalization and exuberant dissection of terms, to the point of often occluding what he wishes to render clear. Branigan’s view of focalization, however—particularly as it detaches character point of view from literal camera emplacement—allows for a reading of a character and its perspective from a more synthetic approach. His schema opens onto the possibility for structuration of meaning across a dynamic of representational cues, across contradictions and associations that progressively invite new interpretations of where or how to read point of view.</p>
        <p>Multiple voices-off represent a fascinating cross-section of the kinds of structural intersections Branigan notes at work in film narrative. Separating off the workings of character point of view in this chapter, however, is not a strategy to imply that other narrative levels (the “<span>narrator</span>”/extracharacter- linked levels, in Branigan’s schema) do not contribute to the spectator’s reading of the film. Though female voice-off can represent and offer to the spectator a feminine point of view, other readings of these films are possible, and other narrative levels may work similarly or at cross-purposes to the effects described here. This “<span>cross-purpose</span>” friction, however, cuts both ways: Branigan’s demarcations of narrative levels and the absolute hierarchization he sets into place between them are unnecessarily rigid. There is no reason to ascribe greater weight or thrust of meaning to the “<span>higher</span>” levels (“<span>extra-diegetic,</span>” “<span>objective,</span>” etc.) than to the “<span>lower</span>” ones that may actually at moments confound, contradict, or destabilize the suturing of meaning. The idea of “<span>gaps</span>” and “<span>excesses</span>” in a text, and their revelation of something that the dominant ideology cannot contain, surely is not new. Branigan’s model fails to come to terms with this idea, however, except by default. Though he defines the hierarchy in terms of “<span>the number of assumptions that must be made [which] narrow the range of knowledge available to the spectator,</span>”24 this notion of “<span>knowledge</span>” slips onto a larger assumption about “<span>objectivity</span>” and “<span>truth</span>” that leads to a dominant reading of the text. Branigan’s implicit assertion that the patriarchal “<span>objective</span>” narrational level supersedes other readings of a film (such as comes forth in his examination of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>) makes it clear that this hierarchy is anything but a mere theoretical convenience, free of ideological implications itself, in its valuation of “<span>objectivity</span>” over the “<span>subjective.</span>”</p>
        <p>If, for example, the point of view of a character represents the discursive problem of the text, might not the level of point of view expand to “<span>bracket</span>” the level to which it is, in Branigan’s schema, “<span>subordinate</span>”? Branigan’s model, meant to provide a means of elaborating how meaning is processed, opening up various strata that interact, paradoxically visualizes meaning in a funnel-like shape that maintains certain levels as superseding and dominating others. Thus the level of “<span>thought</span>” (in my view, connected to point of view and to spectatorship) at the “<span>bottom</span>” of Branigan’s paradigm is always “<span>subordinate</span>” to the level of the “<span>text</span>” (connected to extra-fictional constructs and ideology) at the top. As these levels seem so different as to defy strict hierarchization between them, the construction of an absolute relation seems unwarranted. (It would not be hard, for example, given a different interpretation of “<span>knowledge</span>” such as is implicit in psychoanalysis, to turn Branigan’s pyramid upside down.) With a slightly more free-flowing approach, however, the powerful implications of his model unfold. Surely, if the classical Hollywood cinematic text is the “<span>chameleon</span>” he describes elsewhere, it allows for the various levels to be exercised in multiple directions for multiple meanings.25 Must the more “<span>detached</span>” voice of an implied author or “<span>nondiegetic narrator</span>” necessarily “<span>count</span>” more for a viewer processing the film? Is it not possible that viewers may latch on to the meanings that attract them most deeply or which reflect the subjective contradictions of their own lives—even as they discern and process the other, more “<span>objective</span>” narrative levels? Indeed, despite the limiting of meaning that some of his specific analyses represent, Branigan’s work overall supports the possibility of plural address.</p>
        <p>Part of the purpose of this work, then, is to show how the “<span>level</span>” of character point of view itself can simultaneously work on different narrational strata to affect our more “<span>objective</span>” reading of the larger film narrative. As a site of discussion, films with multiple voices-off bring the particular problem of character point of view into relief, as it were: they accentuate the idea of shifting point of view or conflicts in point of view amongst characters. Multiple voices-off also underscore the importance of examining character subjectivity relative to a dynamic reading of voice-off, the images it inhabits, and the progressive working of narrative movement. That is, point of view does not “<span>belong</span>” with or to the character who is speaking, at the cost and suppression of the subjectivity expressed by a character whose voice-off has stopped speaking. This is too rigid a notion of subjectivity (locked to speech), of narrative (locked to an idea of the present), and of space (locked to a privileging of presence). Rather, point of view emerges “<span>between</span>” the image and the voice, belonging to neither, but marked and generated by both. In such films, this “<span>between-ness</span>” is doubly represented—part of the signifying process (in which the difference evoked between the image and the voice constructs a point of view dependent on both) and part of the narrative (in which the different “<span>subjectivities</span>” of multiple characters allow a heterogeneous point of view to emerge). The point of view that emerges from such plurality is not ultimately, as Telotte has suggested, a “<span>single,</span>” “<span>limited</span>” perspective.26 The voice-off exceeds limitation. The voice, as we have seen, always admits something of the Other (the image, the absent, the offscreen, the Mother). Films with multiple voices-off represent more than battlegrounds for dominance of meaning or “<span>point of view wars</span>” waged by competitive subjectivities. Rather, they crystallize a view of paradox: in them we may observe difference sustain itself. Point of view in these films emerges “<span>between</span>” the characters, traversing boundaries, opening onto heterogeneity in a positive sense. The multiple voice-off renders the consciousness of the characters as a kind of “<span>middle</span>” point of view—not attributable to one or the other alone, but to both, together and in contradistinction.</p>
        <p>The term “<span>consciousness,</span>” used loosely above, is loaded with rich and often contradictory meanings attributed to it from a long history of philosophical, Marxist, psychoanalytic, and even linguistic explanations. For the present discussion, its very vagueness, its vernacular use, denoting an awareness of a point of view, or a subjectivity, is of central interest. In this sense, one that probably finds its roots in the cogito (and the pre- Lacanian/Freudian subject), consciousness could be described as an idea, a representation (that could be figured linguistically, politically, or discursively) of the mind’s eye, rather than a state of being (or impossibility of being) per se. This is how a spectator could perceive consciousness as a place, a position, a point of view. Consciousness, moreover, can be seen as a process, one that reflects the dialectical dynamic of the middle voice, or of a paradoxical relation, recognized, apprehended. A split is embodied in consciousness, as is a transcending of that split—between voice and image, between voices-off, between the spectator’s hearing and seeing. This dialectic, the paradoxical movement by which, on the various levels, “<span>opposites . . . [are brought together] . . . in such a way that they are no longer opposite in their former and univocal sense,</span>” also situates the subject’s experience as a kind of “<span>self-consciousness</span>”—a state of synthesis. 27 This “<span>self-consciousness,</span>” which allows for the recognition, rather than the foreclosing, of difference, which frequently finds paradoxical representation, has discursive implications that I will address in Chapter 3. Thus, films interpolate the viewer’s consciousness, and they also <em>represent</em> consciousness per se, illustrating and evoking the “<span>field of the mind’s eye</span>” that Kawin describes.28 The prevalence, in fact, with which the word “<span>consciousness</span>” surfaces in studies of voice, is notable. It speaks to the effort, within many different theoretical approaches, to account for a psychological connection between the voice and thought (as demonstrated in Chapter 1), and the difference between the mind’s eye and vision. As a character expresses the workings of the inner mind through voice-off, these connections flex powerfully to link consciousness to point of view—a point of view that “<span>cannot be seen</span>” in the image.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Inner Vision: Seeing through Blindness</h3>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em> opens with Celia’s voice-off accompanying a sequence of abstract images all connected through a stylized dolly move— drops in a pool of dark water create languorous, ringed ripples, a floating paper boat drifts offscreen as drowned daffodils rise to the surface, their roots exposed in ominous shadows. If we imagine for a moment that the film is silent, and that Celia’s voice does not reach us to color this abstract sequence with the imprint of her subjectivity, we can know nothing yet of the story or of how to interpret these mysterious images.29 Without the sound of her voice, and the meaning of the words she speaks, these images as such “<span>belong</span>” to no one, neither to us nor to a character. No visual logic links them: they are remarkably opaque and resistant, almost defying signification beyond a primitive recognition of the referent. But Celia’s voice-off, which accompanies these images, in fact, underscores that they are not meaningless at all: rather, they represent a component of a highly subjective and textually privileged point of view. Her voiceoff helps us to “<span>see</span>” what these images relay to our eyes—the internal landscape of a character’s dream. Celia tells of “<span>remembering long ago . . . reading a book that told the meaning of dreams,</span>” and then lists a number of “<span>Freudian</span>” symbols that map onto the image suggestively, “<span>. . . if a girl dreams of a boat or a ship, she will reach a safe harbor. But if she dreams of daffodils, she is in great danger. But this is no time to think of danger—this is my wedding day.</span>”</p>
        <p>At the very outset of this film, then, image and voice-off conspire to signify what could be termed an impossible view: the visual and auditory articulation of Celia’s internal experience, the images and sounds of her mind, a blurring of unconscious and conscious representations. The voice-off, in its relation to “<span>inner vision,</span>” calls upon memory, inspiring the spectator’s empathetic understanding of the images seen as nonvisual—not apprehended by the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>, at any rate. These are curiously blind images, images that cannot be seen except through the highly subjective, “<span>deeper</span>” vision of the mind. Sharing them with this mysterious character, we participate in a point of view that as yet defies the limitations of the visible.</p>
        <p>Which signifier—the dream “<span>image</span>” or the dream “<span>voice</span>” (here representing her internal thoughts, to which we are privy)—initiates the journey that takes us inside this unusual point of view would be hard to pin down. Where do we place Celia? Is she offscreen somewhere, recalling the book that triggers these images for us? Does she inhabit the screen, like a ghost inhabits a house—there, but not there, recalling the images the book once triggered, her remembered visions obscuring the representation of the “<span>real</span>”? Or is Celia alongside us, “<span>watching</span>” these images that provoke her memory of the book? Certainly, we have inadequate information at this point to determine what part these images and sounds play in the diegesis. But we can at least say that the voice-off here directs, in a fundamental way, the viewer’s perception of what he or she is “<span>seeing</span>”: the secret images of a “<span>girl’s</span>” dream, images that appear from an indeterminate, ambiguous space, providing the impossible look “<span>inside</span>” the narrator’s head, to her conscious (and unconscious) thoughts.</p>
        <p>The voice-off here, however, insists on more than the meaning of what we see, as it launches a narrative movement (implicitly promised in both the voice and the camera’s traveling motion) that will take this “<span>girl</span>” from safety to danger. The voice-off, that is, expressly inaugurates a point of view, an “<span>I,</span>” where Celia’s voice and Celia’s internal vision both merge and split into what could be described as a “<span>mind’s eye.</span>”30 This “<span>I</span>” should be vised as the emissary of the middle voice, in this context, an ambiguous, dialectically driven subject. This “<span>I/eye</span>” emerges <em>between</em> voice and image, conceived in their radical heterogeneity, so to speak. What makes this initial sequence so fascinating is how completely offscreen space dwells in the image and how this evocation of what is not and cannot be “<span>there</span>” urges us to recognize a kind of mental awareness. The dream images have no meaning in themselves, needing the interpretive work of the voice-off to designate them, to place them. But the voice-off, here, can only explain these images as absent signifiers of a point of view so denuded of character, of context, of presence, as to be entirely abstract, figural. Celia’s voice emerges from an indefinite space, addresses no one specific, but, reaching us via the images of a resurrected dream, initiates the viewer’s apperception of her as consciousness. Not yet a character (we have not “<span>met</span>” her, except via the signifiers of her internality [her voice/her “<span>vision</span>”]), Celia, for the moment, <em>is</em> this point of view, this organizing mind—and so, via her voice-off, is the spectator. Her words, set out against a complete lack of ambient sound, wield an effect Amy Lawrence has described as “<span>[denying] the particularity of the voice in space, allowing it to fill the theater, becoming something inside the hearer rather than ‘out there.’</span>”31</p>
        <p>The voice-off that inaugurates this film, coincidentally, sets out the primary symbolic axes that will structure the film as a whole: the linking of love and marriage (for a woman) to death and danger; the “<span>key</span>” of Freudianism for opening onto the latent and manifest symbolic work of the film; and the evocation of narrative as an “<span>internal</span>” journey into the recesses of the brain.32 It would not be realistic to undertake an extended textual analysis of each these trajectories here, but they all factor significantly in tracing point of view in relation to the voice-off, and hence will surface in tangential ways throughout this chapter. This opening sequence, more abstractly, represents a textual “<span>navel,</span>” such as Freud has described exists in the dream. The narrative emerges in some originary way from this prologue, but these images also remain “<span>outside</span>” the diegesis, never really assimilated into the space of the film. This sequence in the film, a “<span>tangle,</span>” remote, inaccessible, is “<span>a spot where it reaches down into the unknown.</span>”33 Connected powerfully to the voice—like the voice itself—this opening is umbilical.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">From Consciousness to Character: Point of View as Textual Evolution</h3>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>’s narrative structure refracts endlessly, like the mise-en-abîme of two mirrors. A dissolve links the opening abstract images to the interior space of a church—wedding/funeral bells toll as a shadowy wedding ceremony begins. The anonymous voice-off finally is attached to the image of Celia as she prepares to walk the aisle/plank. But this “<span>attachment</span>” of voice to body is loose, unconfirmed as yet, as we still hardly perceive her features and have not yet heard her “<span>real</span>” voice confirm itself as belonging to this particular woman’s image. No synch sounds soften the juxtaposition of voice to image: their originary disunion is stressed. This is again, like a “<span>silent film</span>” sequence, set up against the sound that has equal weight. The over-determined “<span>dreaminess</span>” of the image suggests we are still in Celia’s dreams, still seeing images internal to her brain. But a sudden shift in the expressive tonality of the voice-off brings us into the diegesis with dramatic emphasis, suggesting that this dream may have suddenly turned out to be the story. As Celia steps out of the shadows, she suddenly whispers (and her whisper brings the music and the tolling bells to a stop), “<span>My heart is pounding so—the sound of it drowns out everything.</span>” Significantly, we do not hear the sound of Celia’s heart; we hear only her voice and the silence from which it abuptly emerges. This silence is what “<span>drowns out</span>” everything and simultaneously “<span>brings out</span>” the voice. The silence underscores, on one hand, what she is saying (she is afraid/excited). It also represents a filter, one that mimics her state of mind. Like Celia, we only hear one thing: what is in her head, and in ours—her voice. That we hear her whisper, instead of a pounding heart, brings us to the crux of what is at stake for this character, for the film, for the spectator. We are not “<span>one</span>” with Celia, in the sense that we share her body (her heart is not our heart, that is). Rather, we are near her, so near that her whispered voice effortlessly reaches and reverberates in our ear. We are “<span>with</span>” her. Since we know, moreover, that she is not “<span>really</span>” whispering (we see her lips are not moving)—we understand that this whisper represents her thinking mind.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a mutation has already occurred in conveying her point of view as “<span>thoughts.</span>” Where earlier she is “<span>represented</span>” entirely by the voice—“<span>she,</span>” as a voice emerging from the space of a dream that may only be the imaginings of the words in a book, is pure point of view, an impossible subjectivity, so to speak—here she assumes visible form and begins to represent the point of view of her character, a point of view that seems more “<span>objective</span>” inasmuch as it gives us a “<span>place</span>” from which to view the story.34 There is a sense here of an evolving point of view, one that is in both instances linked to Celia’s interiority (emerging from “<span>inside her head</span>”) but which opens up from a hallucinatory space to one of narrative functionality. We advance in our understanding of “<span>point of view</span>” in this film via a progressive representability of Celia’s voice as point of view, moving from abstraction to increasing referential specificity and yet saturated with the very fluidity of its signification. The voice now chimes poetically “<span>with</span>” the bells, underscoring our sense that we are no longer “<span>in</span>” the dream but “<span>seeing</span>” it. We begin to suspect that the dreamer is awake but perceiving her world, her situation, as dream-like. Her point of view, now, implies a distortion, a “<span>veil,</span>” a curious awareness of being in the story <em>and</em> outside it. The wedding may well be “<span>happening</span>” in the diegesis; the spectator, however, cannot tell, as he or she shares Celia’s point of view, a point of view that is anything but stable at this point. Celia, in fact, recognizes, as she returns to a normal speaking voice, moving out of the hyper-subjective connotation of the whisper and putting on a new hat, that of “<span>narrator,</span>” that her subjectivity is in crisis. She muses, “<span>It’s said, that when you drown, your whole life passes before you like a fast movie.</span>” The implication of the words, that she is a drowning woman about to “<span>see</span>” her whole life flash before her as she prepares to meet her death in marriage, eases the way for a structural conceit—a flashback (of her “<span>life</span>”). Simultaneously, she recasts this dream scene as part of her story, the moment when the narrative of her life simultaneously stopped <em>and</em> replayed itself so we/she could see as she drowns. In watching what follows, we again gain access to what is “<span>inside her head,</span>” what projects in her consciousness “<span>like a fast movie.</span>”</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Spirals, Vortexes, and Vertical Temporality: Radical Inwardness</h3>
        <p>Indeed the next scene, highly expositional, does give us a quick sketch of Celia’s life history. “<span>Holding out</span>” for someone as “<span>good</span>” as her brother, she has a history of broken engagements. Celia acts like the stereotype of the commitment-phobic man, refusing to “<span>tie herself down.</span>” Moreover, for a moment we consider that perhaps we have not flashed <em>back</em> at all but, rather, <em>forward</em>, for the previous “<span>dream</span>” scene could easily be interpreted (at this point, anyway) as Celia standing up her most recent fiancé at the altar. This intriguingly inspecific narrative time, and the ease with which it conveys forward and backward movement simultaneously, pervades this film on many levels. The narrative overall is composed of several spiral movements that turn in on each other. Much like in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman, All about Eve, A Letter to Three Wives</em>, etc., the voice-off in this film propels a narrative movement in an internal, vertical, “<span>vortexical</span>” direction. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, however, could be said to have an even more radically spiral construction than does <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>, the in- and out-points of the flashback slipping back and forth, rendering a temporal topography of a structure composed of crisscrosses, slidings, gaps, and excesses. Yet, if the web of scenes is brushed away for a moment for us to get a look at what begins and what ends the story, it seems, in a sense, that very little “<span>time</span>” elapses over all—that this is the story of Celia’s thoughts as she <em class="notranslate" translate="no">walks down the aisle</em>, her “<span>fast movie</span>” about the life to come (and the life which must end, as she “<span>drowns,</span>” her identity dissolving into Mark’s). The tale of a “<span>marriage</span>” that separates the opening wedding scene from the “<span>return</span>” to the honeymoon site functions like a ready-made fantasy that works out Celia’s ambivalence, allowing the story of the couple to “<span>resume</span>” in its wake. In a sense, then, the narrative plays out the female character’s desire like a troubled fantasy. It circles in on itself: the horizontal/ temporal motion of the narrative stands still, while the fantasy drives down with spiraling vertical deviations that respond, here, to the crisis engendered by the character’s desire to both desire <em>and</em> to be. Freud tells us that the fantasy, in a sense, has already been written and can be “<span>edited</span>” wholesale into the dream, allowing for what we might in a movie describe as a long vertical narrative digression, like the one here.35 This diversion of narrative energy in a perpendicular direction should not be confused with paralysis, or with suppression. As in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>, the point of view associated with the female voice-off, the point of view that prevails here to subject temporality to space, strives, in prevailing, to sustain the difference posed by the Other.</p>
        <p>Much of contemporary narrative theory is predicated on a linear, horizontal model that privileges the “<span>forward</span>” motion of cause and effect, a model which seems singularly irrelevant to a narrative that “<span>moves</span>” in a vertical or spiraling fashion, a narrative that folds in on itself, rather than unfolding. The prioritization of the linear progression of narrative over a spatial, vertical digression from causality often leads theorists, also, to use metaphors of containment and suppression when describing such structures. Moments of “<span>stasis</span>” or circularity, and the characters associated with them, are represented as “<span>trapped</span>” or stuck within the dominating, sense-bearing advance of narrative movement. Mary Ann Doane, for example, describes the repetitive, cyclical structures of films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman, Humoresque</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Letter</em> as “<span> . . . (“<span>transforming</span>”) repetition from a tool of cognition into an instrument of pure affect,</span>” one that is played out textually as “<span>waiting</span>” by a “<span>woman who <em>has the time</em>.</span>”36 She continues: “<span>A feminine relation to time . . . is . . . defined in terms—repetition, waiting, duration—which resist any notion of progression.</span>” Films bearing this kind of time, she notes elsewhere, “<span>immobilize.</span>”37 Raymond Bellour and others have many times pointed out, however, that cinematic narration <em class="notranslate" translate="no">depends upon</em> repetition (and difference) to progress at all.38 Undue pessimism has frequently been attached to the repetitiveness in “<span>women’s</span>” films, in understanding the repetition that characterizes them as, for example, solely “<span>about</span>” inertia. One would be hard pressed, indeed, to distinguish an “<span>active</span>” repetition from a “<span>passive</span>” one: such definitions seem tautological, biased by predisposed assumptions about films of this kind. There is no reason why the complex relations of time and space in film (or narrative per se) should be predicated on a model where time determines meaning (any more than the image should be read “<span>alone</span>” in a film bearing sound) in suggesting point of view. What of space, for example, which seems particularly invoked by the “<span>vortexical</span>” temporal movement described above? The maze-like quality of many of these films render them “<span>rhizomatic</span>”—“<span>burrows</span>” of multiplicity that “<span>deterritorialize</span>” film form.39 As for the “<span>diversionary</span>” structures of these films (where flashbacks distract us endlessly from the story’s “<span>track</span>”), it may be worth repeating that both Roland Barthes and Stephen Heath suggest that the very pleasure of narrative, in fact, lies in a principle of digression, of diversion. 40 Moreover, Barthes stresses, this digressiveness is “<span>paradoxical: [the text] must set up <em>delays</em> (obstacles, stoppages, deviations) in the flow of the discourse; its structure is essentially reactive, since it opposes the ineluctable advance of language with an organized set of stoppages.</span>”41</p>
        <p>Bearing this dialectical movement of the text in mind, Noël Burch and Jorge Dana’s view of the narrative structure of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em> proves somewhat misleading. Burch and Dana, in outlining the economy of signification of the classical Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> at large, with its overdetermination and obviousness of codes, notes this film as one of camouflaged linearity, wherein noticeable departures “<span>from the norm . . . [are] only passing stylisations.</span>”42 They suggest that “<span>from the very first shot, the whole film is organized to facilitate . . . [the] flattening [of] every signifier under the tyrannical weight of the signified. This economy of expressiveness, in which everything is determined by a single-purpose articulation, clearly defines one of the basic ingredients of linearity, the mechanistic relationship of cause and effect.</span>”43 Although their observations of the predilection toward linearity as an effect of narrative in Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> cannot be denied, it also merits some rethinking. Their analysis of linearity in this film does not account for the simultaneous and considerable pull of vertical movement. Moreover, far from being “<span>determined by a single-purpose articulation,</span>” <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>’s narrative structure is excessively complex, and its “<span>causality</span>” is in many respects oblique. It may be helpful to provide a quick overview.</p>
        <p>In short, the structure is composed of a series of spirals and inversions that empty out at an ambiguous “<span>time</span>” at the narrative’s conclusion, a narrative time one could read as very closely following the opening scene of the film. Moreover, these spirals ultimately insist on the spatial over the temporal. I map the structure as follows:</p>
        <p>1. Prologue: Celia’s remembered dream (a possible flashback, flashforward, or extradiegetic scene).</p>
        <p>2. Wedding A: Celia realizes she’s marrying a stranger (possibly a flashback [from extradiegetic space of voice-off], simultaneous to prologue or following prologue <em>or</em> still entirely extradiegetic [dream]).</p>
        <p>3. Flashback A: Celia remembers Rick/meeting Mark (possibly a flashback within flashback [from wedding] or flashforward [Wedding A could be a remembered wedding of an earlier jilted suitor]).</p>
        <p>4. Flashforward A—Wedding B: Celia returns to church (possibly a flashforward from Flashback A <em>or</em> another flashback [principle of deferred crosscutting] <em>or</em> simultaneous [principle of deferred alternation]—i.e., both the wedding and the flashbacks all are “<span>happening</span>” in Celia’s mind).</p>
        <p>5. Hacienda A—Honeymoon #1: possibly <em class="notranslate" translate="no">flashforward</em> (from wedding/ Flashback A) or flashback—Celia’s voice-off “<span>looking back</span>” (“<span>I should have listened to the dark voice in my head</span>”).</p>
        <p>6. Levender Falls—The Honeymoon’s Over, Part 1: possible continuation of Honeymoon #1 <em>or</em> flashback or flashforward (same principles as above).</p>
        <p>7. Mark’s voice-off confession—The Honeymoon’s Over, Part 2: same as above—Mark imagining/looking <em>back</em> (on having murdered her)/ looking <em class="notranslate" translate="no">forward</em> (to his trial).</p>
        <p>8. Hacienda B—Honeymoon #2: flashforward (imagined “<span>happy ending</span>”) or flashback (imagined relived Honeymoon—maybe the story was Celia’s nightmare?) Other permutations are possible.</p>
        <p>It should be clear from this sketch of the plot that the structure here is anything but “<span>linear.</span>” The movement rather <em class="notranslate" translate="no">spirals</em>—spirals in a number of directions simultaneously, both temporally and spatially. Moreover, it is far from clear “<span>which direction</span>” we are to read these spirals as going: the causality of narrative logic is anything but obvious. The helixes architecting the film make our reading of the diegesis complicated (this is a story of a woman who meets a man who tries to kill her—it is also much more twisted than that). For the helixes are not only in the service of the story, its temporality and narrative space, but they are also in the service of the point of view. As these spirals move into the past, into the future, and into imagined space, they create a crosshatched narrative movement. They map out levels of knowledge (restrained by temporal order), imagination (conducted by the associative paths of dream and memory expressly evoked here), and space (linearity bracketed by verticality).</p>
        <p>With regard to this last category, clarity is crucial. The most linear part of this film (the events at Levender Falls) is deeply embedded “<span>inside</span>” the scenes that are most unstable, spatially and temporally. The spectator accesses the post-Honeymoon crises via a progressive unsettling of temporal cues. The linearity of this “<span>inner</span>” part of the narrative itself, then, is brought into question, since its context is ambiguous at best. In particular, two sets of scenes—the two hacienda scenes and the two weddings—echo each other and retain an unstable place in the “<span>linear plot.</span>” The scene sets present an unbalanced reciprocity (the two weddings “<span>folding</span>” in and refracting an uneasy construction of time/space toward the first third of the film, the two hacienda scenes refracting “<span>across</span>” the second two-thirds), and contributes to the sense that this narrative’s movement works along strongly spatial lines—relations between scenes and other signifiers being detached from a pure cause-effect chain linkage, one that linear temporality and coherence underscores.44 Rather, the scenes connect vertically, poetically, and the narrative movement unfolds inward. The idea that such an “<span>inward</span>” motion, as well as an insistence on space, necessarily renders the narrative “<span>static</span>” or paralytic, seems a socially-inspired reflection on the “<span>stigma</span>” attached to the coincidence of the spatial and the female in cinema—connoting confinement, claustrophobia, madness, death. Temporal ambiguity and spatial complexity, as suggested to a large degree by the voice-off, here render this narrative dynamic and elaborate an articulation of point of view that moves past literal “<span>alignment</span>” with a specific visual field into a deeper affiliation with a process that sustains and recognizes both the lateral temporal progress and the vertical spatial movement of the narrative.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Identity-in-Difference: Vocal Fusion</h3>
        <p>After the death of her brother, Celia, on the brink of a safe engagement to reliable (but boring) Bob, takes a “<span>last fling</span>” in Mexico. In a central city square, she is transfixed by the spectacle of two savage “<span>Latin</span>” men fighting “<span>with bare knives</span>” over a sultry gypsy. Her voice-off tells us she was “<span>strangely held,</span>” both by the idea of violence attached to love and by the recognition of the “<span>pride</span>” she imagines the gypsy woman feels (having inspired murderous desire). One of the men’s knives sails through the air, hitting shockingly close to Celia’s hand. But she does not flinch, nor does she comment on her near brush with death. Instead, we cut to her in close up as her voice-off describes her sense that she’s being watched: a “<span>cold</span>” feeling of “<span>eyes touching [her] like fingers.</span>” The reverse shot of her questioning <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> into offscreen space reveals Mark, staring at her. This shot-reverse-shot inscribes a reciprocity to their desiring <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>, much like the famous scene at the opera in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> in which Lisa senses Stefan’s <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> upon her. In both scenes, the woman’s voice-off speaks of being “<span>watched,</span>” and the reverse-shot that comes to confirm the male <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> explicitly marks the male character as desirable himself. Both Mark and Stefan, in these scenes, appear out of context, a pure refracting look that exists only to mirror the woman’s consciousness of desire “<span>in the air.</span>” These shot-reverse-shots—abstracted, almost jarring, certainly awkward by any standards of continuity—in fact provide no spatial or perspectival orientation (of a visual sort). Rather, they function here very much like images that are marked as part of a character’s memory: cameoed, set off from real space, they highlight the narrative moment that the female voice-off privileges—a moment of reciprocal desire. (Indeed, the shot of Stefan, which, according to Susan White, was only included reluctantly by Ophüls at the last minute, is also a near-perfect reprise of the photograph he signs for a fan in Lisa’s presence “<span>earlier</span>” in the film. Is Lisa, then, “<span>imagining</span>” his face in this moment rather than seeing it?)45</p>
        <p>Celia and Mark, then, first “<span>meet</span>” via a pre-visible “<span>felt</span>” <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>, reminding of Lacan’s description of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> as somehow sensed rather than seen.46 Celia says, “<span>There was a current flowing between us, warm and sweet. Frightening too, because he saw behind my makeup something no one had ever seen. Something I didn’t know was there.</span>” The “<span>current</span>” she describes, articulating their mutually felt desire, flows “<span>between</span>”— between their eyes, now locked across space, between sweetness and fear, warmth and cold, between the visible (her makeup) and the hidden, between the conscious and the unconscious (what she did not know was there). But above all, <em>between</em>, belonging to neither and to both simultaneously, born of difference.</p>
        <p>Point of view in this scene emerges <em>as</em> this “<span>between.</span>” Celia’s voiceoff, at the onset of the sequence, provokes our sense of her internal and subjective emotions: we see the scene through her eyes. And, as earlier, we understand the voice we hear represents her thought process. But in the moment she expresses the feeling of being watched, point of view complicates. If we are aligned with her, then we are watched, as well— though, clearly, as spectators, we are also aligned with whomever is, in fact, watching, whomever is offscreen, where the camera would be. Thus, even before the image of Mark arrives to render visually obvious what is happening to Celia’s point of view, the split has already occurred. The voice-off articulates that split but also provides its simultaneous suspension, its abeyance—for indeed, we share both Celia’s and Mark’s points of view as image and voice “<span>look</span>” at each other. They look at each other, but not as they do a moment later, within the visual perspectival refraction that the shot-reverse-shot sets into motion. It might be more descriptive, in fact, to use Celia’s poetically expressed sense of what is happening, and to likewise think here of point of view “<span>flowing between</span>” them.</p>
        <p>This fusional point of view is brought out even more vividly in the scene that follows. Celia gets rid of her friend, wanting the now inevitable meeting with Mark to take place “<span>on her own ground.</span>” Shot from a slightly high angle, point of view is again split. The voice conjures her anticipatory staging of the scene, as the image suggests a sense of the invisible Mark “<span>watching</span>” her from above. When he walks in frame, this mutual control over perspective persists: Celia’s contrivance of the meeting is underscored by the theatrical mise-en-scène as Mark, on cue, enters stage right—but Mark remains “<span>above her,</span>” aligned with the high angle of the camera.47</p>
        <p>This scene acts to solidify the heterogeneous nature of Celia’s point of view and the way in which her voice-off inscribes a perspective that moves between her and Mark. Their repartee is instructive. Mark teases her about the wallet she’s bought for Bob, saying, “<span>If R.D.’s anything like me, he won’t like that wallet.</span>” She responds, dryly, “<span>He’s not a bit like you.</span>” He rallies back, “<span>You’re not a bit like you.</span>” This dialogue underscores an identity between them, each sentence coming to replace one for the other by means of Jakobsonian shifts.48 Mark proposes himself as a replacement for Bob, which Celia rejects, making clear that Mark is no substitute, but an original—pulling the term “<span>Mark</span>” out of an imaginary dyad with poor R.D. Mark’s final sentence neatly reinscribes couple A (Celia + R.D.) with couple B (Celia + Mark): for, if Celia is “<span>not a bit like</span>” herself, she belongs with a man who, like her, is not a bit like another. This “<span>not being like</span>” establishes their mirror-like relation: only <em>they</em> reflect meaningfully back onto each other. Moreover, upping the stakes of this sudden recognition of self in other, Mark here defines Celia’s problem: she does not know herself (but, apparently, he does). If we look to the story for an explanation of his clairvoyance, his next sentence provides a rationale (“<span>you’re not what you seem to be, anyway</span>”). The lover’s instinct about the essence of the beloved provides him with a special sensitivity to the false demeanor she shows the world. But if we look to the symbolic structuration of identity here, and specifically point of view, it seems that Mark’s knowledge comes from literally having access to her point of view, as it is identical to his. That she does not know herself, by extension, implies, that neither does he. If he can know her in this way (by knowing she has a self beyond her knowledge), she can know him in the same way. In many respects, this conversation marks out one of the primary narrative arcs of the film. Celia’s search for herself will be conducted through her investigation of Mark’s self, of Mark’s secret. The puzzle is only to be solved between them.</p>
        <p>Mark is adamantly “<span>marked</span>” by the film as Mr. Right for Celia, who we know is waiting for someone like her, like her brother. She and Mark share the same morbid fascination for the fight, the imaginary space of their true first meeting, speaking first of its outcome before even introducing themselves. Among the many factors that come to link them in this scene, it is the fact that Mark talks like Celia that strikes the auditor most powerfully. The exaggerated, musical intonation of his voice and the “<span>poetic</span>” mannerisms of his speech, that is, sonorously mirror her way of expressing herself, as she does, explicitly, in her voice-off. It is the peculiar melodic vocalization and representation of Celia’s interior consciousness that Mark’s voice reflects and recalls—her lyrical, internal voice as only she (and the spectator) hears it. For, in ordinary synch dialogue, Celia’s manner of speaking is, in contrast, quite prosaic, delivered in a dry, flat intonation. Mark’s voice, then, in a way, can be said to exteriorize the internality associated with Celia’s voice-off. The mellifluous, poetic charge that emerges originally from within her head, representing her thoughts, desires, and fears, now echoes “<span>outside</span>” the inner domain of her specific subjective consciousness, ricocheting back to her in the silvery words of Mark’s speech. Yet another “<span>between,</span>” this seeming fusion, or confusion of consciousnesses where Celia’s thoughts materialize into Mark’s utterances, signals, again, a kind of identity between them.</p>
        <p>They seem absorbed in a metaphysical flirtation wherein they can read each other’s thoughts, look into the other’s soul. Mark launches into a rhapsodic description of “<span>who she is,</span>” describing her in swelling, mystical terms—“<span>a force of nature . . . turbulent . . . a cyclone about to hit a quiet meadow . . . a strange hush about to be broken,</span>” etc. Celia’s voiceoff, however, suddenly “<span>interrupts</span>” his dialogue, speaking “<span>over</span>” him. Mark’s voice, in fact, is still “<span>there</span>” (we see that he is still talking, his lips move, though the sound of his speech has faded entirely) beneath Celia’s voice-off in this scene. Her inner thoughts rise in volume to dominate an otherwise hushed sound track, “<span>I heard his voice, and then I didn’t hear it anymore. The beating of my blood was louder . . . I knew before I knew his name, or touched his hand. And, for an endless moment, I seemed to float like a feather blown to a place where time had stopped. Strange, I thought then of daffodils.</span>”</p>
        <p>Thus, despite a strong representation of fusion between them here on the level of dialogue, formally, a separation seems effected between them as Celia’s voice “<span>blocks</span>” Mark’s from being heard.49 At first glance, one might assume that she preempts him in enunciatory status: we hear her voice and align ourselves with her point of view; Mark’s voice is silenced, and hence his point of view suppressed.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, the functioning of the voice-off in this scene strongly expresses both their points of view. Celia’s voice-off takes over, it is true, but the sense of alliance between their voices is marked. On one hand, the transitions easing us in and out of the inner recesses of her voice-off here are smooth, imperceptible, inviting. Like elements in a musical composition (which, in their mellifluousness, both these voices very much resemble), their aural interaction is harmonious, inviting no recognition of contrapuntal opposition, dissonance, or other auditory conflict. In fact, the choreography of voices in this scene is carefully orchestrated to highlight each at the proper moment for an overall effect of lyrical speech shared between them.</p>
        <p>As in the earlier “<span>wedding</span>” scene, we are told that her heartbeat has drowned out all sound, but the drowning, in both scenes, arrives in the form of silence. “<span>I heard his voice, and then I didn’t hear it anymore.</span>” Crucial here is the slippage from one to the other, from voice to silence. Just as important, it is Mark’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">voice</em>, rather than his words, that Celia singles out as the source of her pleasure, as the trigger of the silence that follows. Without Mark’s voice, so fascinating in its perfect mirroring of her own, so poetic in its style and resonant in its grain, Celia could not access what is behind the words—the silence. What falls away, here, then, is not really Mark’s voice, but his words—and what Celia hears is the silence that is the other side of the voice.50 His voice affects her in the same way that her voice-off affects the spectator: detaching her from a real space and plunging her into an imaginary one that is marked as subjective, filtered through a heightened identification with an expressed consciousness. Her “<span>point of audition,</span>” here, radically ambiguous, simulates ours. It is a perspective peculiar to the voice, in that it abolishes distance and difference. Mark’s voice is “<span>in</span>” her head, just as her voice is “<span>in</span>” ours. The fact that we no longer hear Mark’s voice points not to his elision from the scene, to the suppression of his voice, but to the representation of his voice qua voice for Celia. For if, as Poizat notes relative to opera, “<span> . . . silence is what best presents the object-voice, as paradoxical as this may seem,</span>” Mark’s silence here presents his voice as such, as the object of her desire and the mark of his own.51 Mark’s silence, really, is an ecstatic excess, internalized by her: moreover, her own voice sets off this silence, renders it acute. Two sides of the same coin, voice and silence, come to “<span>represent</span>” Celia’s point of view here in a new light. Having evolved from hallucinatory subjectivity to subjective thought, the voice now represents two voices, two thoughts, two consciousnesses “<span>collapsed</span>” into one. This collapse, however, should not be confused with a fusion where perspective and point of view are lost altogether, or with a battle in which one collapses into the other, at its own expense. Rather, here, the spectator can recognize Mark’s “<span>voice</span>” <em>in</em> Celia’s. The silence bears as much weight as the voice: their difference sustains a kind of union. The point of view evoked here belongs to neither Celia nor Mark exclusively, but emerges between them. For, though Celia is “<span>listening</span>” to Mark’s voice only to find herself blanketed in the silence “<span>on the other side of</span>” the words, she is also listening to her own voice, to her own silence. The spectator is aligned with her consciousness, but this consciousness is rapt in communion with another.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Thinking in Circles: Sliding down the Dark Side of the Voice</h3>
        <p>This collusion, however, evolves into a problem: Celia’s difference, her separation from Mark is brought into question. The beginning of the film dedicates itself to defining Celia’s problem, specifically, as <em>not knowing herself</em>. Mark suggests that she does not know who she is, just as the larger narrative sets her up as “<span>asleep,</span>” “<span>dreaming,</span>” “<span>unconscious,</span>” “<span>drowning</span>”— in a word: ambivalent. (The voice-off, however, works to counter-indicate this problem: she speaks from a place of knowledge to come.) In the fight scene where she “<span>feels</span>” his troubling consciousness in the cool air at the nape of her neck, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">idea</em> of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> levied at her invites her to discover her own look. She casts a look back to see Mark, but this returned <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> is also a look within, a new consciousness of herself via a mediator that deepens and doubles her own point of view.52 In that she gazes at herself, her <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> might be described as narcissistic. But neither the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> nor the object of that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> is in the least reducible to Celia’s fascination with her own image. Rather, the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> is a look inward—the object, the truth of “<span>who she is,</span>” her “<span>self.</span>”</p>
        <p>The question of a woman’s trouble in discovering her own identity, in knowing herself, then, serves to launch this narrative. But Celia’s identity and consciousness, by the close of this first spiral turn, are conflated with Mark’s. Specifically, the film redefines Celia’s problem <em>as Mark’s mind</em>. Indeed, the bulk of the rest of the film is dedicated to this detour through Mark to herself. She can solve the riddle of her self, the film implies, only through the unlocking of <em>his</em> secret. We “<span>return</span>” to the wedding scene (B) which links the first spiral to the second: in this transition, the shift of emphasis from Celia to Mark is evident. Starting out in present tense, Celia’s “<span>stream of consciousness</span>” voice-off stresses her fear at “<span>marrying a stranger,</span>” fantasizing about running away (as she has done before). But, giving in to social convention (“<span>it just isn’t done</span>”), her voice-off slides into a past tense, “<span>narrating</span>” mode, musing, (now, apparently after the fact), that maybe she <em>should have</em> followed the “<span>dark voice</span>” in her head. The voice-off then recedes even more emphatically from the problem of her own desire, moving into an explanation of the legend of the hacienda’s fountain, as the image circles the courtyard, coming to rest on the sleeping couple. This progression from Celia’s “<span>interiority</span>” out into the space of the couple is underscored moments later, when Mark opens his eyes and an identical tracking shot re-spirals across the space, with his “<span>voice-off</span>” (offscreen dialogue) taking the place of Celia’s to comment on the “<span>felicitous</span>” character of the architecture.53 Mark’s point of view is thus inscribed as doubling Celia’s, and underscored as the point of an elaborate transition from the first part of the film to the second. This shift emphasizes that point of view is complicating here to account for Mark—moving from Celia’s self-absorption to her obsession with her husband (an obsession, however, that is still very much about her).</p>
        <p>This second spiral turn engages the second third of the film, which can be split into two halves or phases: the “<span>early phase</span>” of their marriage, in which Celia’s ambivalence towards her husband develops into overt fear, and the “<span>mature phase,</span>” where Celia openly challenges her fear and Mark’s problem. Celia’s voice-off, initiating the narrative’s second spiral twist, turns obsessively upon Mark, struggling to come to terms with his “<span>strange</span>” behavior, with his sudden distance. Where earlier, her internal ruminations express the immediacy of her desires and fears, the voice-off in this section narrates events with more detachment, divulging a kind of analytic interpretation of events rather than an “<span>experiencing</span>” of them. This slightly more “<span>narrative</span>” quality puts Celia’s narration “<span>on the side</span>” of conventional male voice-off, generally speaking, although it still bears many of the audible codes associated with “<span>female voice-off</span>”: poeticism, lyricism, obsessive repetition, etc. (One need only think of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Out of the Past, Dark Passage, Murder My Sweet, Double Indemnity</em>, etc., to appreciate the distinctive “<span>narrating</span>” tonality usually associated to the male voice-off.) In one instance of this “<span>narrating</span>” voice, Celia, furious at Mark for his gloomy indifference, considers going “<span>home</span>” to New York. Then, she “<span>conjures up</span>” Rick, her dead brother. The rest of her voice-off in this scene comprises of “<span>Rick’s advice</span>” as she imagines it—admonitions to stand by her man, even when he is moody, “<span>for better, for worse.</span>” Celia’s inner thoughts, now explicitly mediated by patriarchy, are channeled into the service of preserving her marriage—but also, significantly, of empathizing with her husband, for as she admits to herself (or as Rick “<span>accuses</span>”), she’s “<span>no easy dish herself.</span>” Referring his strange behavior back to herself, she naturalizes it, a tactic used over and over in the film to augment suspense and appease our fears. Indeed, this whole section of the film vacillates, via Celia’s anxiety about her husband, on an interpretive seesaw of meaning. Is Mark mad? Or is Celia paranoid? The film gives us every reason to believe both explanations, before tipping the balance, apparently, in Celia’s favor.</p>
        <p>At the center of this section, Celia’s voice-off “<span>breaks down</span>” in front of David, Mark’s son, after David reveals that Mark “<span>killed</span>” his first wife Eleanor. (Fittingly, this sequence immediately follows a brutal argument between David and Mark, who shouts at his son, “<span>Are you deaf?</span>” It is Celia, in fact, who “<span>can’t hear</span>” in the next scene.) Paralleling the mutual seduction scene described earlier, Celia again “<span>blocks out</span>” the sound of someone’s voice, but this time it is not an ecstatic communion that fires the silence around her. Rather, the isolation of her voice-off here represents her disconnection from “<span>reality,</span>” her disorientation and confusion, and implies how deeply she now identifies with Mark and his psychic state. Admitting that she’s “<span>thinking in circles,</span>” she recycles “<span>clues</span>” to Mark’s neurosis (“<span>the gardener said he had the lilacs dug out . . .</span>”), observes her own inability to speak (“<span>David is leaving. I shouldn’t have let him go like that. I should have defended Mark</span>”), plunges deeply into her fears about Mark (“<span>Can one kill by purposefully denying love?</span>”), and finally comes to the central question: “<span>What goes on in his mind that he can change so suddenly? He keeps it locked, like this door. I have to open them both—for his sake.</span>”</p>
        <p>This passage makes Celia’s project clear. Appended to the earlier tantalizing prospect Mark’s strangeness suggested to her, of seeing something new in herself through him, is this further realization—she must “<span>unlock</span>” the secret of Mark’s psyche to reach her own. Generally speaking, the voice-off in this passage is only linked through loose juxtaposition to the image, freely floating over Celia’s face to drive home the idea that we hear her thoughts. These moments of the film, however, signify as privileged doublings of voice and image, as strongly amplified alignments of Celia’s inner thoughts and her visual perception. Thus, despite the powerful undertow to Mark’s consciousness, Celia’s point of view is still strongly present here. The present tense that governs throughout this scene, moreover, complicates her point of view in two key moments of purposeful connection between image and sound. She watches David leave and “<span>thinks</span>”: “<span>David’s leaving . . .</span>”—underscoring her paralysis. So, too, does she “<span>see</span>” the door she must unlock (and we see it with her) as she utters, “<span>He keeps it locked, like this door.</span>”</p>
        <p>The door she “<span>sees</span>” during this sequence looks like the door from a dream—abstracted from diegetic space, hypersymbolic, Freudian. We associate dream images with Celia’s internal vision, but this is “<span>Mark’s door,</span>” coincidentally, a door that leads into Celia’s room, thus a room that “<span>symbolically</span>” represents both their subjectivities as a single (secret) space. The moment then, that Celia’s voice utters the words “<span>like this door</span>” and we see the door, represented like an image on some internal screen in her mind, we also perceive that this internal image is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">what Celia imagines Mark sees</em>, and also what he cannot see past.54 (The door is closed, opaque.) Again, in the very privileging of Celia’s subjectivity, her point of view intersects with Mark’s.</p>
        <p>The uneasy midpoint of the film emerges between two critical eruptions of voice-off; the first accompanies Celia’s discovery of Mark’s dark secret and her clandestine access to the locked room, the second occurs after Celia flees out into the night, terrorized by the revelation of Mark’s murderous desire. In the “<span>bedroom</span>” scene, her voice-off moves from disbelief to compassion to shock as she realizes, “<span>It’s my room. It’s waiting for me.</span>” Crucially, her consciousness here is expressly linked to Mark’s, as she speaks directly to him, “<span>Oh Mark, darling, you blame yourself—you torture yourself. You think you killed because you couldn’t give her love. That’s why the room is only a copy. You couldn’t kill . . .</span>” Celia thus holds an imaginary conversation with Mark “<span>in her head,</span>” conjuring him up, much as she did her dead brother Rick. But with this difference: where formerly she imagines how Rick would chastise her, and “<span>listens</span>” to him via her own voice, this time she talks “<span>to</span>” Mark, and <em>he</em> “<span>listens,</span>” in her imagination. In both instances, however, it is quite obvious that Celia is in both “<span>places</span>” at once, able to comprehend the other’s point of view as well as her own.</p>
        <p>It is in the imbalance between the candlesticks that Celia recognizes the truth about Mark, and herself; just as he is her problem, she is his.55 Where she believes her solution lies in “<span>understanding and helping</span>” him, his evident goal is her eradication, the erasing of her signification of the feminine (conveniently marked by the castrated candle). This mise-enabîme between them, where identity, desire, and consciousness seem dangerously unstable, culminates in Celia’s recognition of a paradox: to “<span>know her self</span>” through Mark, she must abandon her subjectivity, which is “<span>his</span>” problem.56 Her apparent submission or subjugation to that erasure seems evident in her panicked flight before his implacable stride down the dark corridors and shadowy staircases of Levender Falls, her doomed retreat into the dark, foggy grounds. A man follows her into the shrouded landscape, where we hear her scream and lose her altogether in a fade out.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Scream: Voice Degree Zero</h3>
        <p>Mary Ann Doane has described the effect of this scene in strong terms, pointing out that “<span>the blackness together with the scream signify an extraordinary violence—a discursive rather than a physical violence, for this scene marks the end of Celia’s voice-over.</span>”57 A discursive shift does indeed take place here, but not as “<span>a forceful and disruptive transfer of the discourse from Celia to Mark.</span>”58 Celia’s scream, in fact, opens onto a different interpretation of “<span>what has happened</span>” to Celia’s point of view, and, specifically, to her voice-off (which in the next scene is indeed supplaced by Mark’s morose voice-off fantasies about the murder trial to come). Her scream, rising out of silence, reminds, for one thing, of those moments where her voice-off is “<span>linked</span>” to silence—to the other side of speech, where meaning falls away, to a “<span>pure voice.</span>” The scream of the woman, of course, is a compulsory fixture in certain film genres, particularly suspense and horror films, as well as melodrama. A woman’s scream, an auditory excess, points, in a general sense, to a violence done the woman’s body/image on-screen or off—it comes to stand, like a strange synecdoche, “<span>for</span>” the woman’s body, to which something frightful has been done. Similarly, Poizat notes that in opera, the “<span>art of the voice,</span>” “<span>the cry</span>” is frequently associated with the death of a woman protagonist, the soprano. He also notes how rarely such a cry occurs in relation to a male hero. With one exception—the male hero who “<span>is projected from ‘spaces/places’ (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">lieux</em>) of characters who have something to do with what one might call a feminine position, but in the sense where the position of The Woman established in operatic fantasies . . . is not the position ‘of’ woman, but a position ‘outside-sex’ (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">horsexe</em>).</span>”59 The cry or scream, then, is linked either to the female voice or to a voice that is neither strictly speaking female nor male, but something “<span>outside</span>” (and between) the two. This “<span>sexually indeterminate</span>” cry, as Poizat describes it, is “<span>high</span>”— soprano.60 Could then, this scream of Celia’s, a soprano moment of “<span>pure voice</span>” lanced out against silence and breaking with speech as such, be of this order—a scream “<span>of</span>” the voice “<span>between</span>” her and Mark? (The only other scream in the film, that of the gypsy woman, is, in a sense, “<span>how they met,</span>” again, a linking of their subjectivities through voice-off. Significantly, that scream’s denotation of fear quickly converts [retroactively] to a suggestion of eroticism. Both these connotations follow to the scream here, where Celia “<span>meets</span>” Mark’s desire.)</p>
        <p>For, as indicated above, there is a confusion of identity between Celia and Mark—not only a blurring of their subjective positions and boundaries, but also, crucially, their characters’ points of view. The scream is connected to both of them, connected to an expression of fear that both characters embody in this narrative, a fear of their own desire. Significantly, too, the scream marks a moment in which we imagine they have finally come together in offscreen space—a rare event in this part of the narrative, which rather repeatedly articulates their separation and distance. Moreover, both Celia and Mark “<span>disappear</span>” at this moment: it is frightening precisely because we cannot see either of them, cannot place them visually at all. Where earlier we sense Celia’s voice-off is the “<span>origin</span>” of the images we see, here this orienting point of view “<span>disappears</span>” (along with Celia with/into Mark) and we do not know where to attribute perspective. The loss of the visual referent to the guiding consciousness “<span>behind</span>” the scene suggests a point of view in crisis. Unable to read the image, or “<span>see</span>” what is happening, we however do (powerfully) perceive a kind of “<span>zero hour</span>” of subjectivity brought out by the scream and the unseeable image. This perception of a turning point of subjectivity is the focalization here, and no wonder that it is “<span>attached</span>” to neither Celia nor Mark specifically, for it concerns them both. That this urgent moment is punctuated by a blackout seems fitting. Where Doane describes this fade to black as “<span>a void in the image track,</span>” there really is no such thing.61 Rather, the blackness here represents and signifies a kind of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">blindness</em> for the spectator, and for the characters as well. A loss of consciousness (such as the famous blackouts in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dark Passage</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Murder My Sweet</em>)—but here, with a twist: two consciousnesses getting “<span>lost</span>” in each other.</p>
        <p>Significantly, the “<span>unseeing</span>” view proposed by the image that ends in this scene arrives not through a literal “<span>subjective</span>” point of view shot, but a rather long shot expressing nobody’s view in particular. As Branigan has rightly pointed out, relative to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lady in the Lake</em>, the famous effort to limit point of view and hence to create an impression of subjective alignment with the character failed precisely because the filmmakers confused the representation of point of view with the point-of-view <em class="notranslate" translate="no">shot</em> per se.62 Subjective limitation of a consciousness represented for a character cannot translate mechanically into the literal cinching in of frame lines to simulate circumscribed vision. The long shot, then, of the garden, where both characters have drifted into dark and mist and become indistinguishable, invisible, in fact provides both a representation and an internal focalization of their mutual point of view at this junction: a point of view in climax, as expressed through the cry emerging from an image no one sees. As to the question “<span>Who is seeing that they are not seeing?</span>” it may be relevant to recall Nick Browne’s “<span>nobody’s</span>” shot (in relation to a scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stagecoach</em>) and his reminder that the film subject, “<span>is like a dreamer . . . a plural subject: in his reading he is and is not himself.</span>”63 The shot “<span>no one</span>” sees here, too, expresses a plurality of positions, but a plurality in crisis, collapsing into itself: where Celia and Mark are and are not themselves. Hence, a crisis not only for the characters but for the viewer who tries to “<span>be in several places at once</span>”—places, that, it would seem, are evaporating before her/his eyes.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Hallucinations, Collapsed Limits, and “<span>Shared</span>” Voices</h3>
        <p>The resolution of this crisis seems to be the loss of Celia’s subjectivity, as witnessed by Mark’s sudden usurpation of the voice-off in the next scene. Where, formerly, Celia inhabits every scene, suddenly she has been “<span>eliminated,</span>” and Mark’s presence and importance are now constrastingly highlighted by the narrative. Mark tortures himself with paranoid images (as both verbalized graphically in his voice-off and literally rendered on screen in fantastic Kafkaesque abstractions reminiscent of the Dali dream/hallucination sequences in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Spellbound</em>) of the trial scene “<span>in his head,</span>” where he will be called upon to declare “<span>whether the murder was premeditated.</span>”64 The spectator can only presume that Celia <em>was</em> murdered in the garden. And yet there is a nagging suspicion throughout Mark’s masochistic selfflagellation that perhaps we should not jump to conclusions: this scene is too over-the-top to be reliable (its overwrought stylization makes it less realistic, more “<span>fantastic</span>” and hence less credible, than the rest of the film). If this is finally Mark’s point of view, that is, we now perceive how warped that point of view really is—and we do not trust it.</p>
        <p>In fact, Celia’s point of view and her voice-off are still very much “<span>present</span>” in the scene, despite her seeming elision. If we understand the project of this part of the film as an attempt—and specifically Celia’s attempt—to interpret Mark, then this voice-off responds directly to this effort, finally getting “<span>inside</span>” Mark’s head and showing us what he’s thinking. His voice here responds to her desire, and to the powerful mechanism of her investigatory drive. Indeed, what would Celia’s voice “<span>be</span>” if, in fact, she could speak for/as Mark? In the scene leading up to the crisis of their reciprocal desire, she speaks to him in her head. Now he speaks, not to her, but to an imagined judge and jury: but his response is a confession, a revelation of his secret—the very expression she so desires to make him pronounce. (In fact, this scene in Mark’s room could be construed as the “<span>reverse shot</span>” of Celia’s interior <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> into the locked chamber which embodies Mark’s consciousness, as we see him stage and perform her insights into his psychology: “<span>Oh, darling, you torture yourself,</span>” etc.) Moreover, Mark’s thoughts here are clearly mad, as he imagines killing Celia, or rather having killed her, just as she imagines him desiring to do. Neither hers nor his, this voice belongs to no one. It is, like a “<span>madman’s</span>” or a schizophrenic’s speaking the voice “<span>heard</span>” in the head. An inverse scenario of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho</em>, where the mother’s voice in Perkins’ head speaks psychosis, here the man’s voice expresses madness most directly. But in both cases, madness is suggested because a confusion reigns in the voice: is it male or female? Herein lies its troubling message, its suggestion of a collapsed limit.</p>
        <p>Thus, this part of the film, where we see Mark without Celia present and hear his voice-off take over where hers left off, only superficially implies her textual suppression. For it does not only respond to Celia’s project to “<span>get inside his head.</span>” Mark’s voice-off, that is, functions as an extension of Celia’s. The “<span>voice</span>” we have come to connect with her character (specifically voice-off) now emanates from him. The strong alignment of offscreen space and an orienting perspective with Celia, that is, inflects the voice-off that comes to “<span>replace</span>” hers. Thus, in a way, his voice-off is both <em>his</em> voice (literally) and <em>her</em> voice (figuratively and structurally), inasmuch as it represents her desire—the pronouncing of Mark’s desire—at the same time as it represents the admission of his internal fantasy. The fact, also, that the surface shift in point of view is not borne out by a concurrent displacement of the narrative interest confirms the thesis that we are still following Celia’s train of thought here. This scene in no way upsets, overturns, or derails her/the narrative’s drive to get to the bottom of Mark’s riddle: rather, it extends this movement, logically, in a deepening point of view.</p>
        <p>This “<span>shared</span>” voice-off would have had an intriguing formal precedent in Celia’s originary voice-off itself, if Fritz Lang had been free to construct the sound track according to his inclinations. Lang originally recorded a different actress’ voice (Colleen Collins’s) to serve as Joan Bennett’s voice-off, a radical experiment in “<span>thought voice</span>” that executive producer William Goetz finessed out of the final film. Lang was deeply committed to this “<span>thought voice</span>” technique, in which the character’s interior monologue would have been delivered in the voice of another person (strikingly similar, in fact, to the shared/split voice-off that Mark’s thought-voice suggests)— and Bennett’s recording of her character’s voice-off sealed the ill will between the partners of Diana Productions.65 Since Lang was “<span>enthusiastic</span>” about the original script’s incorporation of this “<span>new method of narration,</span>” it seems likely that his later repudiation of the film as his “<span>worst</span>” reflects his resentment at the frustration of this formal innovation. 66 However, Lang (whether intentionally or not) creates a comparable (if, perhaps, even more radical) instance of “<span>thought-voice</span>” in the scene discussed above: Celia’s “<span>voice</span>” speaks as/in Mark’s as he contemplates the repercussions of his desire. In this respect, the voice-off here represents, on yet another level, a paradox, such as occurs in self-consciousness: “<span>a fusion of subject and object . . . a two-in-one . . . [a] splitting up of the knowing side and the known side, but the known and the knower are patently identical.</span>” “<span>[A] unity-in-difference . . . self consciousness makes possible <em>a fusion of mental entities</em> which would be judged merely contradictory by the standards of ordinary logic.</span>”67 Celia’s and Mark’s desires can be seen thus, as “<span>opposites . . . [brought together] . . . in such a way that they are no longer opposite in their former and univocal sense.</span>”68 They speak their difference, their desire, as this voice-paradox.</p>
        <p>Mark’s desire, coincidentally, is to kill Celia, and if the voice of madness here is as much hers as his, then this desire must be, in a sense, mutual. Celia’s initial “<span>problem,</span>” invoked in Mexico, finds its response here—she is drawn to a man’s potential violence to a woman. Her desire, on one level at least, is to be like the gypsy, “<span>proud,</span>” the centerpiece of a murderous circle of passion. We (and Celia, since the fight is filtered through her) first perceive a woman in danger (through her scream) and only later realize that she is not the object of violence but its Object. The men do not want to hurt her, but to claim her, as booty, as proof of their superior manhood. Mark, in fact, acknowledges this objectification of the gypsy when he tries to pick up Celia, quipping, “<span>to the victor the spoils.</span>” Celia responds to his objectification with élan: she wants objectification (of sorts, for she also want subjectivity within it) and Mark seduces her with his interpretation of her desire.</p>
        <p>It is hardly cheering, from a feminist perspective, to understand Celia’s point of view as married, perforce, to the point of view that objectifies and threatens her, but there is some consolation in the fact that Celia’s subjectivity is still at stake in this scene, indeed, in the film overall. In an ironic respect, the scene in Mark’s tortured “<span>room</span>” captures her subjective point of view best of all—this is a dark glance at a woman’s desire to inspire desire. There is a level, certainly, on which the story can be read much more allegorically (in terms of a woman’s “<span>point of view</span>” over all). Her desire to be desired, her fear of “<span>drowning</span>” in her husband’s identity (taking his name/losing her self), and her fear that marriage is a death sentence for her subjectivity69 all contribute to a fatalistic view of the implications of mirrored reciprocity in love. This scene, then, ironically “<span>centered</span>” on Mark, reveals metaphysical—even existential—fears women feel in a patriarchal bond.</p>
        <p>This is also a paradoxical scene, for Celia is not dead, and Mark’s fantasy is just that. She returns to her mad husband, no longer afraid (on the other side of her fear, now that she’s looked into Mark’s [twisted] heart.) The tables have turned: now Mark is afraid of himself and determined to leave. He comes to her room, and in a wide shot shrouded in ominous shadows, their figures silhouetted, barely visible, he tells her he’s going to New York. She responds that she will miss him, and he urges her to go to Levender Falls (the city) for the night. She claims she is not afraid, he says he loves her, and she replies, “<span>I know.</span>” This scene, in terms of voiceoff, is quite remarkable—their dialogue is rendered in an ambiguous sound strata “<span>between</span>” synch and voice-off.</p>
        <p>It is unclear if they are speaking in voice-off or badly dubbed synch (the frame’s darkness makes it hard to tell, indeed, if their lips move at all). Gently disembodied, their words seem to float over their image, next to their moving lips, but slightly askew, slightly “<span>off.</span>” The uncanny effect, surely calculated (the sound in Lang’s films, like everything else, is notoriously precise), works in a number of directions. It renders the scene “<span>dream-like,</span>” unreal: are they speaking to each other or communicating transpersonally “<span>through</span>” thought? The spectator, in a sense, is doubly a voyeur, as he or she merely “<span>overhears</span>” this conversation (an impression underscored by dim lighting here), halfway between dialogue and voiceoff, only uneasily attached to the story proper, and no longer expressly directed to our privileged ear as the secret recipient of the voice-off. A rare instance of what Kozloff has termed a “<span>voice-over conversation,</span>” this communication differs sharply from a conversation rendered in clear synch dialogue, by virtue of the strong suggestion of subjectivity implied by the voice-off that, shared “<span>between</span>” the two characters, points to their identity-in-difference.70 Now the idea that they both speak “<span>in</span>” (the) voiceoff, suggested above in relation to Mark’s paranoid fantasy, is rendered obvious as they speak via voice-off to each other. Again, too, the voice-off is connected here to a representation of silence—for if these voices are voices-off, then they need not speak to be heard, they speak, in a sense, through the very silence beneath the words. This interior bi-logue here, again, stresses a kind of shared consciousness.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in a sense, it is in the barely perceptible “<span>distance</span>” between them (implied by the miniscule gap “<span>between</span>” the voice-off and the body here) where we can locate the point of view offered for/of our characters. They are literally “<span>in</span>” this gap, in this blind nearness to each other, in this “<span>between</span>” that the voice-off articulates so plainly here. What we “<span>see</span>” represented here is the voice-off itself, rendered visible through the simultaneous detached wide angle long-shot framing (underscoring the remoteness of the characters and the volume of offscreen space from which the voice-off usually speaks), the shadowy figures through which the voiceoff speaks “<span>doubled,</span>” the blurred limit between them, the suggestion of a heterogeneous consciousness communicating, in a sense, to itself.71 It is a “<span>blind</span>” image, similar to the darkness under Celia’s scream but no longer in crisis: rather, in this instance, the simultaneous signification of the two characters’ perceptions seems harmonic, like the playing of a chord. Thus, though this is not a subjective “<span>image</span>” per se, in the sense that it denotes a subjective physical emplacement of a body that “<span>is</span>” seeing, this is nonetheless a highly subjective point of view, shared here by Celia, Mark, and the spectator who perceives their shared consciousness. The voice-off creates this triangle, which, unlike a visual three-way refraction, links rather than splits, elaborates a point of view that is <em>thought</em> rather than seen. The place of listening and speaking, as this scene confirms, the place of the ear, is not a single “<span>point,</span>” as is so often imagined relative to the image, but an alignment with a flow of points, places, consciousnesses.72 This place, this “<span>point of view</span>” detaches from purely visual metaphors, suggesting the synthetic perception of difference. It is the space of the “<span>middle</span>” voice discussed above, a place <em>between</em>. Expressed and represented here by the subtle dislocation the voice-off instigates for the spectator between a perception of image and one of consciousness, between two desires that are one, theirs is still a troubled union; but here, the characters sustain it, perceiving each other through it (rather than as their obliteration).</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Progressive, Deepening Ripples: The Wake of the Voice</h3>
        <p>The conclusion of this film follows with the exorcism of Mark’s demons. Staged by Celia, who takes possession of “<span>her</span>” locked room (the copy of her bedroom Mark has prepared, anticipating her murder), the couple together discover the dark secrets which separate/bind them: symbolic flowers (Celia-daffodils/Mark-lilacs), dead parents, and, above all, repression (the locked door). Significantly, this scene plays like an inquisition (or therapy session), Celia extracting the “<span>truth</span>” from Mark in order to heal him. Significant, because Celia’s questions, though not delivered in “<span>voice-off,</span>” still bear its weight: delivered from offscreen, they probe his image, seek his thoughts. The most heightened of these moments, a protracted closeup of Mark’s face, is accompanied by Celia’s voice, insisting, “<span>you’re keeping something locked up in your mind, Mark.</span>” Laughably trite, perhaps, this moment nevertheless triggers an avalanche of self-understanding from Mark, a torrent of interior connections he was unable to make previously. Due to the integration, so to speak, of voice-off with the character’s diegetic space, Celia’s voice works like a voice-off here, even if it is not overtly coded as such by the film. Just as the point of view suggested by the voice-off has mutated, transformed through the course of the narrative, from signifying Celia’s deeply internal subjectivity to include and sustain that of Mark, the “<span>representation</span>” of voice-off itself has been inflected, moving from radical alterity from the image and the diegesis to radical nearness. Offscreen space itself has both narrowed (the gulf between the voice-off and the image is less trenchant than it was when a strange woman’s voice began speaking of daffodils), and widened (the subjective point of view it provides now expands beyond a representation of one character’s interiority to include two). Such heterogeneity sustained as a kind of union (of consciousness, of difference, of space) constitutes the voice-off. In a sense, then, Celia no longer “<span>needs</span>” the voice-off for her subjectivity to be read in her voice as it sallies from offscreen space in this film, but not merely because, as common sense might dictate, she remains an implied narrator by virtue of once having spoken.73 Rather, Celia’s voice-off has, throughout the course of the film, been progressively structured into her diegetic voice, and into the narrative per se. This should not be construed as a work of embodiment, such as Silverman has described—a forcible pinning of her voice to her body that deprives her of any subjectivity or point of view. Rather, it represents a process of condensation, where the different voices signified by Celia’s voice-off coincide powerfully. This moment, in fact, profoundly links Celia, the diegetic character who speaks, with Celia, the disembodied voice-off, representing an integration and intensification of these two voices coming together. The voice-off, that is, slipping imperceptibly here between non-diegetic space to diegetic space, “<span>also</span>” speaks here, in this shared voice between the “<span>two Celias.</span>” It moreover brings a point of view to bear on the scene, one that is, coincidentally, fully amplified by the close-up of Mark. We “<span>look</span>” at Mark here through the character Celia’s eyes, in a literal point-of-view shot, but this point-of-view shot is associated expressly with her voice, which retains its association to offscreen space and (through concomitant implications) a shared consciousness with him. Thus the “<span>voice-off Celia</span>” finally can “<span>see</span>” with the “<span>character Celia’s</span>” eyes, inhabiting her body in a diegetic, spatial sense. She sees Mark in the clarity of a concert of consciousness between them.</p>
        <p>Ironically, it is with the locking, not the unlocking, of the door that the secrets are revealed. Moreover, it is a <em>sound</em> that triggers Mark’s memory, as it does Celia’s, his mind reaching back “<span>to childhood,</span>” hers reaching back, with the spectator, to where we heard this sound before—“<span>in Mexico.</span>” The original locking of the door, Celia’s “<span>childish prank,</span>” opens a long detour through a masculine psyche, one being unraveled. A second locking finally initiates a return to the space of the hacienda, a feminine space. The lockings both belong, also, to Celia’s desire—the first letting out the “<span>evil</span>” that Mark says was in him, the second locking it back in (like Pandora, Celia’s temptation to see what’s inside dooms her to seeing the truth). Stephen Heath has described how the narrative in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Touch of Evil</em> is triggered by a kiss: its interruption provides the explosive drive for a chain of causality that leads, inevitably, back to the resumption of the kiss, now conclusive.74 The “<span>locked door</span>” in this film does not work on the same principle of causality: not only does it not initiate the narrative per se, but it is constantly returned to throughout the film, an obsessive repetition that allows for one digression after another as the narrative circles in its helical movement. It should be noted that the sound of the locking is as important as the “<span>action</span>” of locking, if not more so. This acoustic effect, its importance, is linked to the consciousnesses of the characters, who come together in recognizing the sound as both past and present. We do not see “<span>Mrs. Robie</span>” herself turn the key—rather, we see a woman’s hand, dissociated from space and reminding, in fact, of a similar shot of the door that emerges during Celia’s internal monologue earlier in the film. Connected thus to her internal consciousness on two levels, the locking sound and the image of the hand that springs originally from her internal point of view bring us back to Celia herself, as a reminder that her subjectivity is still at stake in this film.</p>
        <p>Indeed, if there is something slightly unconvincing about their blissful reunion at the hacienda, it’s not only because the “<span>Freudian</span>” explanation rings a mite hollow to our post-50s ears. If this is a story “<span>about</span>” a certain feminine subjectivity, that is, a story of a woman who wants to know her self but quickly misunderstands herself as her lover, it is also a story of her balking once she sees the truth. The locking of the door serves to “<span>lock in</span>” Mark’s narrative, the one that overwhelms Celia’s for much of the movie (though, as I have shown, this narrative serves merely to <em>displace</em> her own—in psychoanalytic terms, a case of secondary revision of a wish, perhaps, that cannot be told under patriarchy). It also “<span>locks</span>” the narrative as a whole, halting the investigation of her subjectivity so compellingly posed in the opening sequences. Hence, the hidden meaning of the final two lines of dialogue, where Mark admits, “<span>I have a long way to go.</span>” Celia reminds, “<span>We have a long way to go.</span>” Mark can conceive of a subjective trajectory on his own: Celia cannot. The film’s use of voice-off, however, represents <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Celia</em>’s view, not Mark’s, eliciting and articulating this heterogeneous point of view and the shared consciousness <em>she</em> desires, for the viewer.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Reversing the Case: All about Eve</h3>
        <p>It is notable, in itself, that most films elect either a male voice-off or a female voice-off; there are relatively few texts from the 1940s in which overt “<span>shared</span>” voice-off comes into play. Outside of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, the most well-known and oft-cited instance of such apparent pointof- view “<span>transfers</span>” occurs in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve</em>.75 In relation to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, the shift from Celia’s voice to that of Mark’s is invariably read by film theorists as a suppression of her voice and subjectivity, under the logic that the disappearance of a voice-off = the suppression of narratological authority or subjective presence of the “<span>first</span>” voice-off. Contrastingly, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve</em>, where Addison’s voice-off gives way (first to Karen’s, and then to Margo’s voice-off), no such “<span>obvious</span>” conclusion is generally drawn. Rather, as Kozloff suggests and as other critics usually agree, Addison retains control of the point of view, despite his voice’s disappearance. (Addison’s voice, it should be noted, does return briefly within the diegesis after Karen and Margo narrate.) Kozloff attributes Addison’s domination of the film’s point of view to his initial command of speech, his direct address to the spectator and his apparent dictation of the image and sound track. He “<span>freezes</span>” the image to dwell on his thoughts about Eve, himself, and the other characters in the film, and he “<span>silences</span>” other dialogue so that he may be heard. She goes on to describe what she calls the “<span>unequal status</span>” of the character-narrators in this film, claiming that Addison is “<span>the most powerful,</span>” where Karen’s and Margo’s voices-off respond to his “<span>unspoken command to reveal [their] secrets.</span>”76 The rest of Kozloff’s discussion stresses repeatedly that, despite a certain amount of character revelation provided by the female voices-off in this film (Karen’s expressing her “<span>tender heart . . . [and] naiveté</span>” while Margo’s displays “<span>generous . . . self-indulgence</span>”), Addison remains “<span>the frame narrator,</span>” privileged and implicitly present throughout.77 As the representative of patriarchy, Addison’s point of view overwhelms those of the other characters. But are Karen’s and Margo’s voices-off really so marginalized in this film? Is their point of view subservient in being “<span>embedded</span>” within his?</p>
        <p>Kozloff herself notes that Mankiewicz originally intended for the film to “<span>return</span>” to the space of the banquet, so that the characters could pass along “<span>the baton</span>” of voice-off explicitly.78 This suggests, certainly, that, in the historical author’s mind at least, the character’s voices all held equal weight.79 However, even looking at the film in the truncated version, one can offer a reading of the voice-off that suggests that the point of view of the two women finds strong articulation here. Indeed, as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, the point of view is “<span>shared</span>” by these three voices-off—and by the multiple consciousness of the characters with access to this formal element.</p>
        <p>The overall structure of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve</em> works similarly to that of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, in that its temporal/spatial arrangement operates via a spiraling movement inward. We begin at the end, but within moments even the beginning is interrupted, “<span>held up</span>” by a voice that halts “<span>linear</span>” narrative movement, stopping time’s flow. Addison indeed introduces the story with a flourish, and the “<span>freezing</span>” of the image implies that we are hearing his thoughts, which pour out in a rush as “<span>time stands still.</span>” He turns his <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> onto the other characters, and we perceive that much of this initial scene is playing out, in a sense, through his eyes. Important, too, Addison’s voice-off here functions as a digression, a detour from the linearity of plot (and the speech being delivered on-screen that Addison “<span>decides</span>” we do not need to hear). When Addison allows synch sound to take over again, we hear the droning of the “<span>oldest</span>” actor delivering a paean to Eve’s youth and beauty. Significantly, the only image cut during the “<span>actor’s</span>” speech occurs as a moment of voice-off (of offscreen dialogue) as the speaker refers to Eve’s hands “<span>over</span>” a closeup view of this part of her anatomy. Kozloff implies that this moment is the only one <em>not</em> controlled by Addison: but, in fact, this is a shot that could be said to convey Addison’s desire, which we have already heard in the grain of his voice, as he caresses Eve’s name.80 The image itself strongly evokes Eve’s offscreen presence, as it is literally from her implied physical point of view. Thus, point of view, already in this first scene, seems complex, shared between two offscreen consciousnesses, and linked to desire (“<span>for</span>” Eve, but, as made clear in Addison’s narcissism, really for the “<span>self</span>”). In any event, we know that Addison is not only a strong voice-off presence here, but we understand him as constituting a strongly voyeuristic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>. It makes as much sense to attribute this shot to his roving eye as it does to understand the elaborate pans traversing the cast of characters in the previous sequence as authorized by him.</p>
        <p>Interestingly—and paradoxically, perhaps—an argument can be made that the stress on Addison’s point of view as so explicitly linked to the “<span>objectifying</span>” <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> of the voyeur limits him in his relationship to the voiceoff “<span>authority</span>” he bears. That is, despite the markings of “<span>subjectivity,</span>” Addison’s voice-off strongly signifies “<span>exteriority</span>”—he is not “<span>inside</span>” the story but outside it, looking on. Beyond ironic detachment, for example, we cannot guess what Addison is “<span>feeling,</span>” and the voice-off betrays nothing of his potential vulnerabilities here, such as his diegetic behavior towards the close of the film reveals, being in love with Eve but having to blackmail her to keep her near. (Except, of course, for the subtle “<span>grain</span>” of desire remarked on above.) Addison’s voice-off hits the image to bring out subtleties we read in the faces of Karen, Margo, Lloyd, and Bill, but it remains outside himself, his voice-off here functioning like a mask between us and his consciousness. Where Karen’s and Margo’s voices-off contrastingly draw us “<span>in</span>” to a subjectivistic consciousness, Addison gazes out: in this way, his voice-off reflects a less internal bent. One may object that, in this case, Addison is indeed “<span>more powerful</span>” than the others, but only if a hierarchical systemization of narrational levels is assumed. Certainly, Addison has a kind of point of view here, but his point of view is limited, in that he cannot access certain levels of the story. His point of view is lacking, needs the deepening perspective provided by the others. He articulates as much, if we read against the grain of patriarchal complacency he connotes, for his bemused query, “<span>What can there be to know that you don’t know?</span>” suggests, in fact, that he is talking to himself as well as to the audience. (In fact, Addison is later revealed <em>not</em> to know everything about Eve.) Instead of telling us himself “<span>what we don’t know,</span>” he turns his <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> to Karen, almost in appeal. Karen, significantly, does not return the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span>, absorbed in her own point of view, following her own train of thought. Kozloff insists that Addison “<span>commands</span>” Karen’s voice-off to begin. The relationship is rather one of deferral. Addison’s point of view defers to Karen’s, which picks up the story, goes where he cannot go. Where he cannot go, precisely, is into the spiraling narrative of a “<span>feminine</span>” time and space that marks this text. On a par with the male spectator, perhaps, he thinks himself “<span>above</span>” the emotionality the others will display, until he loses what is (in his case) a marker of distance from the text, his voiceoff. A more subjective point of view is revealed for his character near the end of the film—inspired, fittingly, by the disturbing expression of desire spoken by Eve.</p>
        <p>Karen’s voice-off bears all the traditional attributes of a female voiceoff— slightly breathy and quieter than Addison’s, it represents a stream of consciousness rather than a polished discourse. Karen’s voice-off signifies as thought, reverie, a lapsing into the preconscious; she triggers memory/a flashback. (In contrast, Addison’s voice-off registers as performance— the refined elocution of a finely crafted written text.) Karen muses, “<span>I remember I asked the taxi to wait. Where was she? Strange, I’d become so accustomed to seeing her there night after night . . . looking for a girl I’d never spoken to.</span>” Her voice slips imperceptibly from the space of the banquet (speaking off from a future time) to the space of the drizzly street (speaking off from a present tense as she looks for Eve, thinking of the girl she’s never spoken to). Her reverie is interrupted by Eve’s offscreen voice, bringing her into the past/present, calling: “<span>Mrs. Richards . . .</span>”81</p>
        <p>In the scenes that follow, Karen’s point of view and status as the bearer of the voice-off slips imperceptibly into Margo’s. Karen, in fact, leaves after introducing Margo, Bill, and Eve, musing again, in voice-off, “<span>where were we going that night, Lloyd and I? Funny, the things you remember, and the things you don’t.</span>” The scene that follows, it would seem, are the things Karen did not and could not possibly remember, not having been there, diegetically speaking. Yet, it is not inconceivable to associate the point of view here with her voice-off, with her remembering (not-remembering) from the banquet hall. She could be said to bear a privileged knowledge and power greater than Addison’s, for example, in her ability to see and remember what she did not herself experience. But this may be stretching the impact of her voice-off over the images here. For, in fact, the next irruption of voice-off might be said to retroactively structure this scene as a “<span>shared</span>” point of view between Karen and Margo (and Addison, by extension). After Bill leaves, Margo’s voice-off, without any segue at all, launches in, declaring, “<span>That very night, we sent for Eve’s things, her few pitiful possessions.</span>” Then, over what is a remarkably economical scene (it is really a single shot, but is “<span>coded</span>” as a montage sequence through its lack of diegetic sound, to-and-fros of Eve being “<span>helpful,</span>” Birdy casting multiple disapproving glances, Margo eating/lolling), the voice-off suggests at a passage of time during which “<span>the honeymoon was on.</span>”</p>
        <p>The ironical stance of these words as Margo pronounces them, and of the point of view “<span>on</span>” Eve, here, reminds of Karen, whose voice-off has already implied at a radical disjunction between what we “<span>see</span>” (Eve’s sweetness-and-light personality) and what we “<span>know</span>” (via voice-off—the signifier of consciousness). It also recalls Addison, extending his point of view via these feminine emissaries into the space of the story, but thus deepening his voyeuristic detachment into a strong identification with and against Eve. Margo gets “<span>closest</span>” to Eve, her would-be “<span>sister</span>” who desires, specifically, to be Margo. Margo’s desire, on one level, reflects Eve’s. She wants to be what Eve is, young and desirable. Thus, Margo’s point of view is the most deeply “<span>embedded</span>” here. (We have no formal introduction to her as new narrator, and we are almost surprised to recognize that she, not Karen, is now speaking. Moreover, she has only one instance of voice-off in the film, whereas Karen and Addison both speak in voice-off three times.) The most deeply embedded, her voice-off is also the most subjectivistic. The explicit doubling between her and Eve implicates her as “<span>another Eve.</span>” Moreover, Margo perceives Eve’s duplicity before anyone else. Margo recognizes her desire in Eve. Margo’s point of view, that is, clarifies the irony Addison introduces and redefines it in terms of a feminine desire to be an Other.</p>
        <p>Margo’s (and Eve’s) desire for Bill here represents, incidentally, a perfect example of what René Girard calls “<span>triangular desire,</span>” wherein the object is not “<span>the object</span>” at all: it is rather a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mediator</em> who possesses that object, and who represents an “<span>essence</span>” or “<span>being</span>” that the subject lacks and desires.82 Margo and Eve really desire each other, not Bill. Without getting sidetracked into a discussion of “<span>desire</span>” here, it is yet crucial in reminding that this film centers on the female subject—her being, her desire, her fears, and the point of view these engender.83 Margo’s voice-off and our consciousness of her point of view emerge at the vortex point of the spirals that constitute this narrative. Her voice-off contributes strongly to our understanding of her character’s point of view (her subjectivity is split by the mirror Eve holds up to her) but also refracts backward and forward to reconstruct Karen’s and Addison’s points of view. Addison’s ironic distance still “<span>works</span>” here through Margo, but it shows us something different: Eve’s desire rather than his. Moreover, Margo’s point of view continues to structure how we read this film, undermining Karen’s point of view when <em>she</em> next speaks in voice-off, plotting to teach Margo a lesson through a “<span>harmless joke.</span>” Again rendered in stream of consciousness, Karen’s subjectivity, brought out here by her voice-off and by her de-embeddedness (she is “<span>closer</span>” to Addison, the male “<span>exterior</span>” to the woman’s story—not able to see “<span>inside</span>” Eve yet, as Margo does) now signals her <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lack</em> of perspective, compared to the perspective Margo’s point of view embodies. Thus we read Karen’s point of view here <em>along with</em> Margo’s, but now in an inverse direction, Margo’s voice-off having opened onto an evocation of subjectivity that now exposes Karen’s view as superficial. Ironically, however, in Karen’s de-embeddedness, she is doubly embedded—for, in being aligned to a degree with Addison, the limits of this more distant, detached perception of Eve are stressed. Later, when she employs voiceoff to express her feelings of rejection, watching her husband Lloyd cater to Eve’s every whim, she has finally traversed from an Addisonian-type point of view (narrator/external consciousness) to a Margoesque-type point of view (consciousness/internal knowledge). That is, her voice-off functions as an evocation of her subjectivity and a point of view she <em>shares</em> with Margo and the spectator.</p>
        <p>But what of Addison? For one thing, Addison’s status as the voice of male patriarchy seems questionable at best. Surely, he plays with language, wields the power of the word. But he is on the side of linguistic excess, a far cry from the taciturn macho voices-off of film noir. Though ironic about others, Addison takes himself very seriously; he suffers a little from the “<span>sincerity</span>” of a female voice-off in this respect.84 Addison loves to hear himself talk, or rather, loves the sound of his own voice. His voice qua voice, that is, also operates powerfully here, as powerfully as the words he pronounces. But in both respects, he is on the side of the feminine, on the side of the voice per se: the side of excess, of grain, of difference. The voluptuous tonality and linguistic extravagance marking Addison can be said to be a kind of “<span>writing aloud,</span>” which is “<span>nothing like speech,</span>” according to Barthes. “<span>Vocal writing . . . is carried not by dramatic inflections . . . but by the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">grain</em> of the voice.</span>”85 Like a caricature of both female and male voice-off stereotypes, Addison pushes signification to the limit. Sanders’s notoriously “<span>effete</span>” and “<span>feminine</span>” persona, moreover, is strongly emphasized here, as if Mankiewicz encouraged him to milk his trademark queeniness. Further, the character of Addison never denies the drama of the personal, as Bill and Lloyd invariably do. Rather, he revels in the emotional theater of melodrama, the allure of gossip, the reality of sexual politics, and he perceives the validity of the feminine perspective (a perspective with which, one could argue, he would like to identify). He is “<span>the dandy,</span>” a woman’s man, scarcely believable when he stakes claim to Eve. (Significantly, there is no physical relationship established between them, just a master-slave psychological relation.) Notably, the more “<span>masculine</span>” men of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All about Eve</em>, Bill and Lloyd, have no access to voice-off here. They, it should be pointed out, are the most deeply embedded of the characters, and they are routinely manipulated and outclassed by the women that surround them.</p>
        <p>Addison’s voice-off, then, signifies, as it were, “<span>between</span>” a male and a female voice-off, in bearing the attributes of both: speech, detachment, and distance on one “<span>side,</span>” grain, excess, and shared consciousness on the “<span>other.</span>” These two “<span>sides</span>” to his voice, moreover, get played out <em>between</em> the characters as they speak from offscreen space. Addison’s voice, by the end of the film, has lost much of its power and clairvoyance, which were in fact attributes arising from its excess, proximity, and grain. I would argue that Addison’s voice-off, by the end of the film, “<span>caps</span>” the tale in a most perfunctory way, as he gives a brief docu-like rundown on the history of the Schubert theater and proclaims that Eve gave the performance of her life. His voice-off seems, again, distant from the story, a literal spectator who perceives a performance but is no longer “<span>backstage</span>” as the voicesoff have been throughout the film. But Addison’s loss is Karen’s gain, for she successfully integrates Margo’s deeply identified point of view with Addison’s distance. It is Karen’s consciousness and point of view that dominate the last third of the film. This statement is misleading, though, for Karen’s voice-off really represents a shared consciousness between Addison, Margo, herself, and Eve: a point of view that emerges through the difference that voice sustains.</p>
