        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">A Metapsychology of The Voice-off</h2>
        <p>In this matter of the visible, everything is a trap. . . . Certain optics allow that which concerns vision to escape. Such optics are within the grasp of the blind. . . . <em>They have eyes that they might not see</em>.        <p>
        <p>Jacques Lacan, “<span>Of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Gaze</span> as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Objet Petit a</em></span>,” <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis</em>        <p>
        <p>This phantom being of the voice is what is dying out, it is that sonorous texture which disintegrates and disappears. I never know the loved being’s voice except when it is dead, remembered, recalled inside my head, way past the ear; a tenuous yet monumental voice, since it is one of those objects which exist only once they have disappeared.</p>

        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Footsteps and Rustling Leaves: The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> of Sound</h3>
        <p>Sound, and particularly female voice-off, renders acute a cinematic phenomenon of “<span>blind images</span>”—moments in which we are asked to lay down the gaze, to “<span>see</span>” through our hearing, moments that are often identified with a feminine subjectivity. Too strict a correlation has been placed, in fact, within scenarios exploring the riddle of cinematic identification, between “<span>sight</span>” and “<span>the gaze</span>.” Jacques Lacan repeatedly distinguishes between these two terms: he stresses that there is, rather, “<span>a dialectic</span>” of the eye and the gaze.<sup>1</sup> In another fascinating description, he implies that the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> is like an acoustic perception. Citing Jean-Paul Sartre’s discussion of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Being and Nothingness</em>, Lacan notes with approval that “<span>far from speaking of this <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> as of something that concerns the organ of sight, [Sartre] refers to the <em>sound of rustling leaves</em>, suddenly heard while out hunting, to a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">footstep</em> in a corridor</span>.”.<sup>2</sup> Lacan goes on to remind that the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> is not apprehended “<span>in the function of the existence of others as looking at me . . . but in the subject sustaining himself in a function of desire</span>.”.<sup>3</sup> The tendency to attribute desire to vision/the image in the <span>cinema</span> is understandable. Lacan’s hint, however, that vision per se is not the primary issue (and that in fact, the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> can be felt via sound) certainly opens up other ways of conceptualizing desire in the cinematic relation.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to think, in this connection, of the numerous film scenarios that “<span>castrate</span>” a woman by blinding her, suggesting that the feminine can be seen but cannot see, not “<span>externally</span>,” at any rate. This kind of (non) vision evokes Lacan’s description of an “<span>elision of the gaze</span>” in the waking state, and his remark that the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> does not only “<span>look, it also <em>shows</em> (Lacan’s emphasis)</span>.” This reverse side of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> is most evident in the experience of dreaming: “<span> . . . our position in the dream is profoundly that of someone who <em>does not see</em></span>.”.<sup>4</sup> The “<span>blinding</span>” need not be literal, as it is in Sirk’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Magnificent Obsession:</em> it may be figured as a peculiarly opaque vision, as when Lisa confesses, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> (1948), “<span>Somewhere out there were your eyes and I couldn’t escape them</span>,” as the film offers us a glimpse of Stefan’s face. Lisa, whose voice-off directs our attention to Stefan’s visage, seems to “<span>see</span>” him differently than we do, since she cannot locate him visually in the theater. This image, in fact, may be her internal vision of him—her point of view of the man she cannot seize with her outward look, a point of view we access through her voice. Many films thus produce a sense that if the female voice-off sees the image we see, it is “<span>internally</span>.” Such voices, as those in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca, Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Secret beyond the Door</em>, are often coded as a partaking in memory or imagination, “<span>seeing</span>” through an “<span>internal (blind) vision</span>,” whereas the male voice-off more frequently comments in such a way as to suggest that it literally watches the image over the shoulder of the spectator. This kind of vision that cannot see, of images that cannot be seen, is moreover often overtly narrativized in films in which the female voice-off plays a vital structuring role for point of view. A central flashback spiral in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Enchanted Cottage</em>, for example, suddenly introduces the shared voice-off of the characters Laura (Dorothy McGuire) and Oliver (Robert Young), who describe in rapturous tones their mutual metamorphosis from disfiguration to beauty since their wedding day. Their diegetic audience, a blind friend (Herbert Marshall), “<span>knows</span>” as we do as spectators that the characters are seeing each other “<span>through</span>” the filter of their love, and that this transformation is “<span>not real</span>.” Yet, we see Laura and Oliver <em>as they see each other</em> in this sequence, bound to their perception. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Enchanted Cottage</em>, moreover, represents this internal vision as both more subjective (linked to the bias of emotions that “<span>color</span>” what the characters see, and what we see) and more true (freed from the limitations of the visible, the images we share with these characters reveal the “<span>deeper</span>” spiritual perception they access through their love). It is also linked to (shared) voice-off and a point of view it inspires—shared between the two lovers <em>and</em> between them and Herbert Marshall’s character, who is literally blind (and thus already knows what it is to “<span>see</span>” outside the limitations of the gaze). Thus, the female voice-off (here a shared voiceoff) serves as a potential disruption to the specular female body. It connotes and is “<span>used</span>” to connote an intimacy, confusion of limits, and a loss of (objectifying) perspective, even as the image seeks to structure point of view, center and isolate the subject, and insist on the definite in sexual difference. Indeed, Lacan stresses the contrariness between the invocatory drive and the scopic drive: “<span>Whereas <em>making oneself seen</em> is indicated by an arrow that really comes back towards the subject, <em>making oneself heard</em> goes towards the other</span>.”.<sup>5</sup> The “<span>difference</span>” the voice poses to the body leads us, in fact, to a new theoretical model for film scholars and others to figure feminine difference in a positive sense and, more specifically, moves toward a fresh conception of a feminine subject as she may be represented in film or as she may be addressed by it.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Phantom “<span>Being</span>” of the Voice</h3>
        <p>Efforts to describe a voice often betray a difficulty in naming the quality unique to it. Vague analogies and general adjectives seem to fall short of the peculiar tonality that is the essential interest of the voice—a voice said to be “<span>metallic</span>,” “<span>musical</span>,” “<span>hoary</span>,” or “<span>thin</span>” still more or less eludes representation beyond a general sense of its tenor at a given moment. A single voice might bear, for instance, each of these attributes (especially if the speaker is practiced in modulating this instrument for dramatic effect) and yet still hold some distinguishing characteristic that allows for the recognition that this voice is “<span>different</span>” from all others. The voice is often thought to “<span>belong</span>” to someone, or more specifically, to some body, and, moreover, we tend to understand this proprietary relation as immutable. We think of the voice as being within the control of the speaker (except in those moments of physical or psychological fatigue when it betrays us). The voice also seems relatively immune to the physical toll that time takes on the body, remaining constant and recognizable, even when a person’s face or figure may have drastically altered. This independence introduces a schism between the voice and the corpus it inhabits, countervailing the opposing representations that figure the voice as in some way attached or determined by the condition of the body. (In French, Roland Barthes notes, descriptions of the voice often bear a strong physiological connotation—it can be “<span>toothy</span>,” “<span>intestinal</span>,” etc. The “<span>grain . . . is an erotic mixture of timbre and language . . . wherein we can hear . . . the articulation of the body . . . materiality . . . sensuality . . . the breath, the gutturals, the fleshiness of the lips . . </span>”.)<sup>6</sup> The voice speaks of “<span>difference</span>” thus in a double-edged sense: it speaks, on one hand, of the “<span>difference</span>” of this voice from other voices, inasmuch as it bears the mark of a particular body. It also speaks of the difference of the voice <em>from</em> the body itself—the voice bears witness to that which is unrepresentable about the body. It is “<span>unrepresentable</span>,” first, in this sense: the voice resists efforts to image it. Like sound in general, the voice is usually described relative to the “<span>characteristics</span>” it bears—to adjectives, rather than to nouns, objects. Christian Metz has explained that the difficulty of “<span>tracing</span>” the source of a sound is linked to its pervasive ambiguity. Its mellifluous potentiality inspires us, he suggests, to specify or locate the object that produces sound, in order to understand “<span>what</span>” the sound is.<sup>7</sup> The sound itself, that is, defies nomination. The voice is unrepresentable also in the ambivalent relation of the voice to the corpus which “<span>contains</span>” it and yet contradicts it—the body’s materiality controverted by the intangible, aphysical spatiality evoked by the voice. The uncanny way in which the voice suggests both a double for the body and a possible threat to its coherence (hence the desire to describe the voice, to imagine it as an object—visible and qualified—to deny its strangeness to a psyche that craves a certain mastery over the body and the world) may explain the Janus-like split in the history of its human representation.<sup>8</sup> On one hand, “<span>the voice</span>” is mythologized, romanticized in the mystic power of incantation, prayer, the ecstatic fusion with music in song. On the other hand, its ambiguity evokes terrors, the horrors of demonic possession, the lure of the Sirens, insanity, and death. The voice thus expresses the body and inhabits it: it is organic and foreign at once, a “<span>characteristic</span>” that also expresses a kind of subjectivity. It speaks not only <em>of</em> but <em>through</em> the body. The voice strikingly proposes a paradox, a contradiction in which heterogeneous signification dwells in dynamic, constructive expression. In its relation to speech, too, the voice is both “<span>flesh</span>” and “<span>sense</span>”: in words we hear “<span>a voice still mysterious, indefinite, on the slope of meaning</span>.”9 The “<span>oscillation</span>,” Guy Rosolato suggests, between these poles, “<span><em>between</em> body and language . . . is the vibration that gives the pleasure of <em>hearing</em></span>.”10 And where Rosolato compares this oscillation, at moments, to an acoustic mirror, it more properly is described in the less visual metaphors he adopts at other moments—such as the “<span>between</span>.” “<span>Between</span>,” this vibration is no ricochet but is rather a simultaneity in space of absolute difference. Thus, in the final instance, the voice and the body are not truly separable: instead, they form a paradoxical relation within which heterogeneity strongly signifies.</p>
        <p>In its paradoxical effects, the voice can also be said to act as a “<span>middle voice</span>,” such as Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault have described with regard to modern literature. Hayden White describes the middle voice as one in which “<span>actions and their effects are conceived to be simultaneous; past and present are integrated rather than dirempted, and the subject and object of the action are in some way conflated</span>.”11 Neither passive nor active, but <em>between</em>—the voice is both simultaneously. We will return later in this book to this notion of “<span>middle voice</span>”: it is of interest both in its psychoanalytic implications (Freud linked the middle voice to a form of obsessional neurosis close to masochism he deemed “<span><em>without</em> an attitude of passivity</span>”), and in its invocation of a specific consciousness of difference within/of the self.12 The idea of paradox—which leads to the possibility of envisioning simultaneous (and multiple) subjectivities, of transcending “<span>the problematic dichotomy of subject and object</span>”—clears a path for understanding the voice as an index of difference: it is a difference, however, that eventually folds back onto itself in a constitutive way.13 This difference is “<span>recognized</span>” as sameness, sustained as consciousness.</p>
        <p>The symbolic heritage of Western representations of the female voice, indeed, amplifies the “<span>difference</span>” implicit in the voice. The legend of the Sirens who lure sailors to an ecstatic death epitomizes the power of the voice over that of the body. The myth of Echo and Narcissus similarly demonstrates the peril that the “<span>unattached</span>” female voice constitutes for the (male) subject, who, hearing it, is irrevocably lost to desire. Likewise, the female characters of opera possess voices that express the body and exceed it simultaneously, pointing to a desiring subject (one which inevitably undergoes severe treatment for the glorious threat her singing conjures). These female voices evoke the external (the voice as audible representation of desiring speech) <em>and</em> the internal (the voice as expressive of what eludes representation, feminine desire itself). Desire is both triggered by language, then, and heard <em>in</em> the female voice as such—voice produced by, yet never reducible to, the body. Desire and contradiction lead us to the Subject of cinema—the focus of this chapter. Where or what is the Subject in relation to the voice, and specifically in relation to the female voice-off? What is the nature of the link between the cinematic female voice-off and the “<span>voice</span>” per se, both metaphorically and psychoanalytically? What might be the effects of such subject positioning relative to the image that also “<span>places</span>” the viewer?</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Remote Transcendence: The Myth of Distant Subjectivity</h3>
        <p>The female voice-off has often been described in film theory and criticism as a particular form of narrative overlay—as a purported authorial position granted to the female character. Writers such as Kaja Silverman, Mary Ann Doane, and Tania Modleski agree that the female voice-off preliminarily, at least, represents the female character’s ability to speak, and to express her subjectivity. Thereafter (in classical <span>cinema</span> at least), these same writers point out that this gift is hauled back by “<span>male-coded</span>” narrative linchpins that work to suppress the feminine by defining the male at her expense. The female character bearing voice-off, that is, soon “<span>loses</span>” the subjectivity initially promised by her offscreen speaking; her figuration is re-rendered in the text as “<span>object</span>” or image. This movement of containment can come through, for example, the “<span>loss</span>” of the voice-off by a character who ceases to enjoy this speaking privilege, or the inscription of the female voice-off to the “<span>recessive</span>” regions of the diegesis. Whatever the mode of “<span>containment</span>,” it is invariably viewed as evidence of the ineluctable overpowering of the female voice-off by a more powerful “<span>off</span>” voice, that of the dominating ideology of patriarchy. The female viewing subject, too, has been implicated in this containment of the diegetic female character. As we shall see, in the insistence on aligning subjectivity with vision, and centering vision to a masculine subject, the female spectator has been neatly tucked away, rendered “<span>impossible</span>.” This “<span>impossibility</span>” derives from a misguided effort to figure the female spectator’s “<span>subjectivity</span>” from within a set of assumptions that pertain more clearly to masculine subjectivity, assumptions that posit subjectivity as “<span>bodiless</span>,” “<span>imaginary/visual</span>,” and “<span>distanced</span>.” These presuppositions derive in part from a bias that holds the image to be “<span>primary</span>” and sound “<span>secondary</span>.” They also respond to a strongly entrenched analogy in film theory that aligns subject positioning with the transcendental “<span>voyeur</span>” encoded in Renaissance vanishing-point perspective, a spectator whose “<span>pure gaze</span>” dwells with pleasure specifically on the fetishized female form, from a distance.</p>
        <p>The subject/spectator of film has persistently been cast in one of the following ways: “<span>transcendent</span>” (the universal/patriarchal subject implied by the metapsychological studies of Jean-Louis Baudry and Metz); “<span>male</span>” (the arbiter of the objectifying <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> first proposed by Laura Mulvey); or “<span>male-coded</span>” (the “<span>transvesticized</span>” or masquerading female initially constructed by Mulvey and later nuanced by writers like Teresa De Lauretis and Doane).14 These scenarios have contributed crucial insights into the nature of the apparatus and of the viewer’s contract. However, thus far, paradigms of spectatorship have invariably been figured as constituted through the cinematic <em>image</em>, through the subject’s visual relationship to the imaginary signifier. The ideological lesson of Baudry’s “<span>eye-subject</span>,” constituted through a relationship to cinema’s replication of a centering Renaissance perspective that constantly “<span>lays out the space of an ideal vision . . . [and] assures the necessity of a <em>transcendence</em></span>,” stresses simultaneously that the illusory mastery of “<span>reality</span>” arrives specifically <em>through the gaze</em>.15 Importantly, too, Baudry’s “<span>discovery</span>” of the transcendental subject already dissociates spectatorship from the body and betrays an assumption that in spectatorship and subjectivity, the body must be left behind: “<span> . . . the eye which moves is no longer fettered by a body, by the laws of matter and time . . . the world will be constituted not only by this eye but for it</span>.”16 Baudry is critical, of course, of the “<span>transcendence</span>” he observes, as replicating and reinscribing an “<span>ideological machine</span>”—but his own ideological “<span>limit</span>” is evident in his implicit assertion (by default) of the visual axis as not only dominant over sound but occluding its very signification.17 One may very well ask if, as Baudry asserts, “<span>the ideological mechanism at work in the <span>cinema</span> [is] concentrated in the relationship between the camera and the subject</span>,” where does sound fit in?18 Is it “<span>less</span>” ideological than the “<span>camera</span>”?19 Does it “<span>interfere</span>” with the mirroring relationship that enables the subject to transcend the body? Can it be a “<span>mirror</span>” too, even if not a reproduction that traffics in images?</p>
        <p>To Alan Williams, who transposes Baudry’s arguments from the visual register to the auditory, the answer to this last question, at least, is a resounding yes.20 Sounds, he reminds, are representations, reflecting ideological choices that serve to center a transcendental “<span>hearing</span>” subject. Williams’s view of the ideological bias inherent in sound’s representation is of great importance, for he strongly debunks the mythology that sound is merely “<span>reproduced</span>” in film, unaltered by the mediation of the apparatus. 21 Yet his article simply maps Baudry’s scenario relative to image onto sound. Though his remarks on the explicit modulations and distortions of sound—and on the general Hollywood concealment of the signs of production—are both valid and insightful, he disregards the crucial relationship of sound to image. This dialectic structures both the film and the film viewer. The “<span>centering</span>” impulse of the gaze, in fact, is only with great effort reconstituted as a centering of an acoustic subject. Where Baudry is able to point to a long history of such “<span>visual</span>” centerings, the history of acoustic arts is only beginning to be studied in this way.22 Williams’s suggestion that sound’s perspective reflects “<span>one point of space</span>,” rather than a spatial volume, works only if one considers each sound in isolation rather than the mixed relation of multiple sounds, as is usual for a sound track.23 He suggests that microphones are “<span>more like ears than they are like rooms</span>.”24 This may be somewhat true, though sound <em>is</em> affected by the dimensions and textures of the room in which it is recorded, and it necessarily takes on the acoustic quality of that space.25 Though mikes are held out from a point, they have pickup patterns that are diffuse and varied, limited only in their directionality. (Some mikes, in fact, are omnidirectional, pulling in sound from a concentric volume.) Moreover, the mike is not the only element that determines the perspective of sound proper. Rerecording and mix technology allow perspective to be added to sounds that are filtered through spaces and “<span>rooms</span>,” usually to create a stronger or richer sense of spatial volume. A sound recorded from “<span>a point</span>” in one room thus bears a second spatial volume (or point). Indeed, the use of multiple mikes is more than frequent both on the set and in the mix room, where sounds miked at different times in different spaces are combined to play back simultaneously.26 Whether this spatial volume is “<span>real</span>” or “<span>represented</span>” is, perhaps, not as important as how it differs from the establishing of “<span>one point in space</span>” from which something is heard. It is critical, that is, when thinking about the nature of the film auditor’s relationship to sound, to account for the degree to which sound recording and mixing admit heterogeneity, evoke difference simultaneously, and offer an alternate conception of “<span>subjectivity</span>” to the model of lines converging to an “<span>ideal</span>” point, such as has been construed for the image.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Many-Eared “<span>Monster</span>” Spectator</h3>
        <p>Thus the spectator who watches and listens to a sound film inhabits many more than one “<span>place</span>.” There is not one “<span>angle</span>” from which we hear— rather, we effortlessly sustain a spatial volume, a complex web of contradictory sounds, some recorded “<span>close up</span>,” some recorded for an effect of “<span>distance</span>.” As Rick Altman notes, “<span>Just as cameras may have wide-angle or telephoto lenses, changing the angle of image collection, . . . so microphones vary from omnidirectional to narrowly focused, thus changing both the angle of sound collection and the apparent distance of the sound source</span>.”27 The difference for the spectator’s relationship to the two elements of film leaps from between these lines—for the image track selects one view seized by the camera for us to see, while many different angles of sound are presented for us simultaneously.28 The multiple spatial characteristics of sound, moreover—in sound’s relationship to a spectator, a recording instrument, narrative coherence, and the image—extend to each sound in <em>itself</em>, as both Altman and James Lastra have pointed out.29 Each sound, that is, “<span>includes multiple sounds, each with its particular fundamental and array of partials, each with its characteristic sound envelope, each possessing its own rhythm within the sound event’s overall temporal range</span>.”30 In addition, sounds depend on the acoustic chamber in which they are heard: they change according to the place of the auditor who hears them, becoming further multiple. That is, the “<span>same</span>” sound (Altman’s example—a ball breaking a window) sounds <em>different</em> to the father who hears it from the study than to the son playing outside in the yard. Represented sounds (recorded sounds) exacerbate this inherent heterogeneity— given that the point of audition (the theater) differs markedly from the space of the recording—it always sounds different than it did originally. Indeed, people sitting in different parts of the movie theater will hear even this “<span>different</span>” sound reverberate differently still. We are far, indeed, from a <span>cinema</span> that plays to the illusory centering of a single subject. Rather, sound constantly <em>divides</em> the attention of spectator/auditor, each sound a complex of contradictions itself, signifying within a heterogeneous system of sounds that offer contrasting, plural spatialities.</p>
        <p>The <em>distance</em> so often proposed as primary to the spectator’s psychoanalytic and ideological relationship to the film apparatus also comes into question when one considers the specific characteristics of sound perception. As Metz’s vastly influential insights into the workings of the “<span>scopic regime</span>” of <span>cinema</span> have shown, the spectator enjoys a layer of “<span>protective</span>” absence between his body and the image, due in large measure to the physical absence of the object seen, and the mechanisms of fetishism and voyeurism that negotiate a position of transcendence for the troubled Subject.31 Metz has suggested that the auditory track works like an identical twin to the image, allowing for an auditory “<span>voyeurism</span>” that parallels what the spectator experiences relative to the image.32 Lacan, however, suggests that the “<span>desire to hear</span>” (invocatory drive) differs crucially from the “<span>desire to look</span>,” proposing that there is “<span>total distinction between the scopic register and the invocatory . . . field</span>.”33 Guy Rosolato’s findings confirm Lacan’s: Rosolato stresses that “<span>one could establish a system of opposition between the auditory and the visual</span>.”34 Rosolato stresses that visual “<span>interiority</span>” does indeed differ markedly from its acoustic counterpart: the visual is always directed in an anterior sense, whereas sound allows for apperception of posterior space. In this sense, vision “<span>keeps the index of spatial distance</span>” oriented like a “<span>continual confrontation opposite a staged scene</span>.”35 A certain flatness seems to characterize vision, then, while sound constitutes “<span>a spatialization of the outside in the inside</span>.”36 The image that is “<span>out there</span>”—a distant and remote “<span>staged scene</span>”—is counterposed by sound that is both “<span>out there</span>” and “<span>in here</span>” simultaneously. The (meta)psychological experience of sound, then, amplifies the multiple spatiality, which, as we have seen, distinguishes it from the image. Moreover, this spatiality distinctly collapses distance and difference—even as it opposes (in Rosolato’s words) the visual.</p>
        <p>Where the seeing subject’s “<span>contact</span>” with the object vised by the eye renders it (partially due to the mirror phase) “<span>other</span>” and “<span>out there</span>,” sound confuses and links these poles, invoking not an oscillation but a continuum. This alignment of sound with the interior of the body (and specifically the cranium) explains, perhaps, the overwhelming tendency within <span>cinema</span> to represent “<span>thought</span>” and consciousness through voiceoff. (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Female</em> voice-off, in particular, very commonly serves this representational function. Alongside the major examples explored in the chapters to come—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman, Secret beyond the Door</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Letter to Three Wives—</em>striking instances of voice-off as “<span>thought-voice</span>” can be found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raw Deal, Brief Encounter, Since You Went Away, No Man of Her Own</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Walked with a Zombie</em>.) Sound seems, in fact, a closer cousin to the “<span>senses of contact</span>” than sight, as it penetrates the ear, activates the eardrum, inhabits the body. Moreover, whereas we can control what we see to some extent, sound is more insistently active, less easy to block out.37 Metz notes that we only “<span>need close [our] eyes to suppress [the film]</span>,” but surely this is untrue.38 The sound track will continue to play to our ears, to be there, to amplify filmic space, drama, pleasure. Thus, sound is more invasive than the image—and also less distant. Sound must enter the body to be heard, but it also can enter without our permission, or without our “<span>opening our ears</span>” to hear. Sound’s “<span>object</span>,” too, is different from the object that is seen: it is more “<span>active</span>”—it emits vibrations. Whereas the image is seized (first by light and then by the eye, thus rendered, in a sense, passive or “<span>objectified</span>”), sound has, in a strange way, its own subjectivity. It “<span>speaks</span>” in two places simultaneously (or nearly so): at the source and in the ear. As a voice, it “<span>speaks</span>” doubly. The sound track of a film, then, seems, even in these very general and intuitive terms, to invite a “<span>relation</span>” with the subject very different from that triggered by the image. There are even “<span>blind</span>” spectators, apparently, who go to the movies for the sound track alone, spectators whose pleasure would be an intriguing arena for study. Rosolato notes, in fact, that hearing “<span>is not a tributary of the light (one can hear in the dark) and it surmounts the obstacles of what is opaque to vision</span>.”39 Thus, moments in which the voice or sound is accompanied by darkness (no image) should not be understood merely as signaling a frustration to sight—an absence of the visual signifier, the marking of a certain kind of phallic impotence—but also as a heightened moment of sound. Such moments represent an invocation of the specific apprehension of spatiality that hearing enables, and the breaking down of the visual threshold in order (in a sense) to perceive or represent <em>more, beyond, within</em>.        <p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound’s Absence: De-frauding the “<span>Original</span>”</h3>
        <p>The desiring Subject of sound should not be figured relative to visual scenarios inspired by the absent image. We need to consider the peculiar absence of sound in looking for alternate configurations of spectatorship. James Lastra’s work on sound suggests, in fact, that it is always absent. Where Rick Altman, Tom Levin, and others suggest that an “<span>original</span>” sound exists that suffers some kind of “<span>loss</span>” or distortion through technological mediation, Lastra claims that there is no “<span>pure</span>” perception possible in any event, since <em>all</em> practices of audition are “<span>socially constructed</span>.”40 He claims, pointing to Altman’s example of the sound of the shattering window (heard by father and son in different spaces differently), that by definition “<span>there is no strictly definable ‘original’ event . . . each auditor gets a slightly different sense of the sound, depending on his or her location and the directedness of his or her hearing . . . [thus] . . . <em>every hearing is in some way absent.</em> . . </span>.”41 He continues: “<span>The historical happening of the sound event, its spatio-temporal specificity, always appears to escape our apprehension. Whether we’re in an auditorium, or listening to a relatively contextless, closely-miked recording, or to one which stresses the peculiarities of the room, the event, in its fullness, seems to escape. What is the ‘real’ of which these are the traces?</span>”42 Lastra’s description is fascinating and extremely useful in moving this discussion forward to contemplate the specific psychoanalytic and ideologic positioning of a spectator/subject elicited by the female voice-off. Lastra’s evocation here of the “<span>absence</span>” which distinguishes sound differs markedly from the kind of “<span>absence</span>” generally associated with the image. The “<span>absence</span>” Lastra observes seems not so much perceptual loss as perceptual contradiction. That is, in thinking of the image, we rarely doubt that what we see existed at one time, even if we appreciate that it is not really “<span>there</span>” now. With sound, as Lastra suggests, such a doubt always colors perception: there is no “<span>real</span>” “<span>original</span>” sound of which the recorded version is a shadow. Rather, all sounds are simultaneously “<span>real</span>” and “<span>unreal</span>,” “<span>there</span>” and “<span>not there</span>,” “<span>like this</span>” and “<span>not like this</span>.” Thus, “<span>‘in the sound recording the original is still as present as it ever was, which is to say, just as absent</span>.”43</p>
        <p>A paradoxical perception, then, is constitutive of hearing itself, both in our everyday relationship to sound as well as to the sounds we hear/do not hear in the cinema. This figuration of paradox, and of contradiction, implicit in Lastra’s remarks, is central to my own analysis of the voice in cinema. It is my contention that the female voice-off makes these contradictions all the more pronounced, all the more acute for the spectator of film. Another dialectic that Lastra suggests structures sound representations should be mentioned here, a dangling caveat to his theory which has profound implications for the reading of film sound: recording technology can direct our attention in one of two directions with regard to a sound—to favor “<span>intelligibility</span>” or “<span>fidelity</span>.” Dialogue recorded to maximize “<span>intelligibility</span>” strives, for example, to stress the comprehension of the words, where a “<span>fidelity</span>” recording might maximize the grain of the speaker’s voice or the acoustics of the recording space. Thus, again, apart from perception proper, sound is “<span>divided</span>” into different sounds—in fact, we often “<span>ignore certain aspects of the event because our hearing is directed towards certain ends</span>” (usually understanding speech).44 The way we listen thus affects what we hear. What we perceive is inflected by what we are listening for. The framework in which a sound is heard then, extends beyond physical—spatial and temporal—dimensions to include social, psychological, and, one might add, theoretical attitudes. As we turn from sound generally to more closely consider the specific contradictions that characterize the female voice-off in <span>cinema</span> (and the spectator’s relationship to it), it is necessary to understand the “<span>frame</span>” that has surrounded this voice in film theory. Film theory has perceived the relationship between the voice-off and the spectator as fraught with a kind of danger, due to its potential contradictory signification—a danger which leads, ultimately, to voyeuristic/fetishistic positionings effected in concert with the image track. If one listens to this same voice “<span>differently</span>,” however, another “<span>frame</span>” emerges from which to interpret the same phenomenon. One finds, in fact, that “<span>what counts as a significant element (in what we hear) changes as we change our frame</span>.”45</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Heterogeneity, the Voice, and the Body: “<span>Risks</span>” and Reverberations</h3>
        <p>The theoretical “<span>myth</span>” of the transcendent, distant spectator “<span>centered</span>” by the all-seeing/voyeuristic eye cannot account for the workings of sound in cinema. Sound does not “<span>center</span>,” as it provides multiple spatialities simultaneously. Neither does it offer a position of “<span>distant</span>” protection from the (absent) signifier: rather, it places the viewer inside a continuum where the oppositions between object and subject, inside and outside, here and there coincide in vigorous simultaneity. Moreover, sound works in opposition to the image itself, in a radical heterogeneity that the voiceoff renders acute for the spectator/subject. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Imaginary Signifier</em>, Metz broaches the ideological implications of such heterogeneity. Referring to “<span>the anonymous ‘speaker,’</span>” he suggests that this voice-off, “<span>beyond jurisdiction, represents the rampart of unbelief . . </span>.”46 He further indicates that the “<span>distance it establishes between the action and ourselves comforts our feeling that we are not duped . . . [and thus offers the] ‘alibi . . . [of a] naive distanciation.’</span>”47 As we have seen, the idea of “<span>distance</span>” when applied to sound has its problems. Crucially, though, Metz portrays the voice as working in the service of the image, even as it operates elsewhere (“<span>beyond jurisdiction</span>,” behind “<span>the rampart</span>”). A gulf between the image and sound is drawn, but, significantly, not to open up the possibility of heterogeneity, but to close heterogeneity down. The distanciation the voice-off offers is “<span>naïve</span>,” harmless, hardly worth mentioning except to dismiss as a ruse.48</p>
        <p>Mary Ann Doane recognizes the heterogeneity of the voice-off as potentially much more disruptive. She observes that voice-over was a “<span>late acquisition</span>” after the introduction of sound to film, because of the spectator’s desire for synch sound that coheres with image. Synch allows for a “<span>unity</span>” of the “<span>fantasmatic body</span>” reconstituted by the <span>cinema</span> and “<span>confirm[s] the status of speech as an individual property right</span>.”49 After a “<span>‘breaking in’ period</span>,” she suggests, the spectator’s insistence on lipsynch relaxed, allowing for more mobile and non-synch deployments of voice.50 This “<span>public demand</span>” for synch supports Doane’s suggestion that “<span>[s]ound carries with it the potential risk of exposing the material heterogeneity of the medium</span>,” a risk that she stresses is “<span>contained</span>” by technicians who labor to “<span>marry</span>” sound to the image.51 She contends that the voice-off is particularly “<span>risky</span>” in this regard, since it is “<span>disembodied</span>” from the synchronous signifier (what Silverman calls the “<span>specific body</span>”) and that it is peculiar, “<span>uncanny</span>.”52 The voice-off, then, in her view, has no direct connection to the silent cinema; rather, it emerged as a new form of expression unique to the era of sound.</p>
        <p>Charles M. Berg, however, suggests that the emergence of voice-off itself may possibly relate to its historical antecedents—the offscreen commentators and lecturers who spoke during silent films to “<span>explain</span>” their stories or speak “<span>dialogue</span>.”53 Although this tradition was fraught with annoyances (absurd juxtapositions of image with the “<span>wrong</span>” voice, clumsy attempts to emulate synch speech, sloppy elocution, etc.), it not only served the purpose of hiding the “<span>disagreeable</span>” sounds within the theater, but, along with music, made the otherwise (in Berg’s terms) “<span>flat</span>,” “<span>lifeless</span>,” “<span>colorless</span>,” purely silent film experience tolerable.54 Thus at the dawn of cinema, the question of sound’s heterogeneity is already at issue. Patrons demanded it—desired it—willing to abide some rift between sound and image rather than endure the stultification of “<span>pure</span>” image. But clearly, as Berg points out, the more “<span>obvious</span>” the gap between voice and image, the more the signifier’s heterogeneity is underscored, to the point where absurdity can overwhelm the film’s signification. The difference sound brings to image, then, seems more than surplus meaning—it is fundamental, able to construct or to destroy in its relation to the screen.55</p>
        <p>The spectator’s demand here, then, is somewhat paradoxical, insisting on having a heterogeneous signifier (the image is not enough by itself), and insisting that its heterogeneity adhere in a kind of union with the image. Sound, moreover, appears to provide much of the pleasure of film—early spectators found its absence grating, its presence soothing. Indeed, “<span>the impression of movement in the early <span>cinema</span> appeared unnatural and freakish without some sort of acoustic correlate to the visual activity</span>.”56 One cannot really attribute this pleasure to a surfeit of realism, since these “<span>primitive</span>” offscreen narrations and musical scores hardly contributed to ground the image in the real (indeed, they threatened at times to render it more unreal). It seems instead that it is the relationship of sound to image that brings pleasure, a dynamic that points to itself as heterogeneous. Sound brings a spatial volume the image “<span>lacks</span>” while at the same time offering the perception of a “<span>different reality</span>”—a reality, as John Belton has put it, “<span>one step removed from that of the images</span>.”57 The “<span>pleasures</span>” of synch seem incidental in comparison, the use of asynchronous sound being very much “<span>called for</span>” throughout the “<span>silent</span>” era.</p>
        <p>The spectator’s awareness of this relationship of difference between image and sound, and of the “<span>material heterogeneity</span>” of the sound itself, is thus rendered acute through sound that constantly “<span>threatens</span>” to expose its own contradiction to the image. Yet Doane and others insist that this is a relatively idle threat, since classical <span>cinema</span> always works to buttonhole sound to image. However, Doane herself also frequently recalls sound’s difference as though it were a ticking bomb. Though she sees sound as having its own ideological ax to grind (a discourse of knowing through emotion rather than intellection, buttressed through sound’s “<span>intangible</span>” quality), she notes that the combination of sound and image “<span>entails the possibility of exposing an ideological fissure—a fissure which points to the irreconcilability of two truths of bourgeois ideology</span>.”58 Indeed, this fissure, in my view, can be said to structure all films. To approach this divide, to plumb its depths and scale its significance—how it relates to all the other “<span>contradictions</span>” that have surfaced already in looking at the “<span>history</span>” of the voice-off—it is necessary and instructive to look more deeply into the subtleties of Doane’s arguments. For Doane’s work is not important merely as one of the first to chart the metapsychological repercussions of sound and the voice for the spectator and within the narrative of film: her observations set out the terms of the major debates and her theses remain provocative and influential, offering numerous tangents ripe for exploration. Among these, the question of space—the visual and the nonvisualizable— that she raises is particularly valuable. Space, I shall argue, constitutes a way to figure, relative to the voice-off, a place of subjectivity not contingent on the body and its visual restrictions.</p>
        <p>In an early article dedicated to the voice in cinema, Doane repeats her view that sound “<span>risks</span>” exposing the heterogeneity of the cinematic signifier, but (significantly) she now shifts the emphasis and definition of sound/voice’s ideological “<span>message</span>.”59 No longer does she associate the sound track (incarnated here as “<span>voice</span>”) to knowing through feeling or emotion, but she suggests, rather, that its ideological burden resides in its relationship to the body. It is in voice-off’s “<span>detach[ment] [from a] . . . represented body [that] its potential work as a signifier is revealed</span>.”60 Two issues seem raised by Doane’s shift here. First, in separating out the voice from other auditory effects, she implicitly stresses that voice is a special problem in film sound, needing a more sustained analysis, specifically with regard to its particular relationship to the body and to its discursive power as a form of speech. That is, in important ways, voice is “<span>different</span>,” even from the sound track itself. Second, she seems to cast the voice-off (and the voice proper) as having a discrete and possibly more intricate ideological function relative to the image than other sounds. This ideological complexity, in fact, relates directly to Doane’s revised assumption that the “<span>interior</span>” spoken by the voice and voice-off in <span>cinema</span> speaks of the body rather than the emotions and feelings she mentions relative to sound proper. More material than other sounds, bearing the body that produces it, it is still acoustic, spatial—less material than the image. Her implied view of the voice here meshes closely with my own. Seen in this way, it threatens a heterogeneous contradiction to both the “<span>image</span>” and the “<span>sound</span>” tracks—it is somewhere in between, neither interior nor exterior, speaking from and of the body, rendering the corpus in space, as it floats alongside images to which it appears, at moments, to bind. In Doane’s ideological arrangement, moreover, wherein discursive “<span>types</span>” of knowledge adhere to the two tracks, the voice again seems in a netherworld between—neither part of “<span>the ideology of the visible</span>,” the real, the intellected that Doane attributes to the image track, nor entirely belonging to the ideology of “<span>mystery</span>” and immateriality presented by sound, which invokes knowledge through emotions, intuitions, and intangibility. The voice is both and neither simultaneously—an intangible evocation of an interior space, a cipher, a material effect of the body.61</p>
        <p>In pointing to the body as the primary discursive and ideological “<span>trouble</span>” proposed by the voice, rather than to the sense-bearing power of speech, Doane moves the question of the voice’s heterogeneity and difference into feminist ground. In post-1970s film theory, the question of the body necessarily introduces the problem of sexual difference. On one hand, the distinction Doane draws now between “<span>embodiment</span>” and “<span>disembodiment</span>” for the voice has important repercussions for the study of discursive movement and enunciation in films bearing voice-off. (I discuss these ramifications in depth in Chapter 3 of this book.) On the other hand, this demarcation raises some provocative new questions about subject relations to the apparatus. Here, we move past ontological debates about the relationship or hierarchy between the image and sound track to home in on a site where these two seem to “<span>meet</span>” and to signify their contradiction most strikingly and powerfully: the voice-off. Doane’s point here is that the “<span>meeting</span>” between sound and image “<span>in</span>” the voice-off takes place expressly through the relationship drawn by the text between that voice and image-bodies seen or imagined relative to the diegesis. A second “<span>meeting</span>,” however, is implied by Doane’s terminology, which renders the voice and voice-off as though they achieve or reflect some degree of physicality, some incorporalization. This “<span>meeting</span>” occurs between the spectator’s body and the “<span>body</span>” of the voice. The implications of such an encounter are radical, as we shall see.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Turning the Body into Space</h3>
        <p>In certain moments, Doane appears committed to understanding the “<span>body</span>” of the voice as synonymous with the visible diegetic signifier, stating that “<span>the voice-off is always ‘submitted to the destiny of the body,’ because it <em>belongs</em> to a character who is confined to the space of the diegesis, if not to the visible space of the screen</span>.”62 But, in other passages, Doane’s writing seems to indicate that the body perceived in or through the voice by the spectator is not just the diegetic “<span>anchor</span>” provided or left in abeyance on screen, the image of the character who appears to speak or (in voiceoff) to think aloud. She suggests, in one such remark, that in the “<span>interior monologue</span>,” the voice “<span>is the privileged mark of interiority, turning the body ‘inside-out.’</span>”63 Thus the voice also functions in a fantasmatic sense, to suggest a body that cannot be seen, a body, in fact, that has been “<span>emptied</span>” into the voice, and turned, in a sense, <em>into space</em>, a space that is both interior and exterior—the “<span>inside</span>” no longer simply inside but also “<span>out</span>.” Following this train of thought, we can look beyond the visible locus of the <em>character</em> to whom the voice is attributed in understanding how the body can “<span>speak</span>” through the voice. Indeed, the voice-off thus appears to create a space beyond the diegesis that confines the subject who “<span>appears</span>” to speak. (Vocabulary in describing this kind of “<span>space</span>” is tricky: it is beyond, but also behind, within, alongside, intersecting the diegetic space.) In fact, in a provocative digression from her main argument, Doane herself compares the relationship voice-off holds to image with the relationship voice-off holds to space, offering a hint as to what kind of “<span>body</span>” we might “<span>hear</span>” in the voice: “<span>The voice-off deepens the diegesis, gives it an extent which exceeds that of the image, and thus supports the claim that there is a space in the fictional world which the camera does not register. In its own way, it <em>accounts for</em> lost space. The voice-off is a sound which is first and foremost in the service of the film’s construction of space and only indirectly in the service of the image</span>.”64 Although Doane means here to explicate how voice-off (which in her terminology refers to a potentially embodied “<span>offscreen</span>” voice rather than a disembodied voice-over) affects the construction of narrative space, a number of her statements open onto other possibilities. At every turn in this passage, Doane’s vocabulary suggests that the voice-off introduces a non-visualizable construction of space, one that “<span>exceeds</span>” the diegetic space provided by the image and that in fact reconstitutes a “<span>lost</span>” dimension, space itself, heterogeneous to the image to which it offers a lively and constructing contradiction. At the very least, her final sentence makes clear that Doane sees the role of the voice in spectatorial relations as anything but “<span>secondary</span>”—it is, rather, responsible for the evocation of a fantasmatic dimension that “<span>deepens</span>” the diegesis, <em>but not in terms of the image</em>.        <p>
        <p>Thus, we find both a “<span>body</span>” and a “<span>space</span>” signified simultaneous to an image but not signified <em>by it.</em> The “<span>body</span>” of the voice-off, may, in fact, be understood as “<span>belonging</span>” more properly to the space than to an image that may retroactively come to “<span>anchor</span>” it, since it is coincident with the space and not with the image that is attached to it only through the logic of the diegesis. The voice-off speaks of a body in space, a body that is heard, not seen. Even if the diegetic anchor of a proffered body comes to “<span>signify</span>” its claim to that voice, the voice-off’s “<span>other</span>” body constantly speaks alongside it, just as the space of the voice-off “<span>exceeds</span>” as well as “<span>deepens</span>” that of the diegetic image. One may argue that this logic works only when applied to what Doane calls “<span>interior monologue</span>,” which turns the body inside out, funneling the body into space, bringing these two terms into a continuum, a congruence. But it is with regard to “<span>voice-off</span>” (a category which in Doane’s view is much “<span>nearer</span>” to embodiment than “<span>interior monologue</span>”) that she offers these provocative remarks about the space created through the voice. Indeed, these two textual placements of (in her taxonomy) “<span>voice-off</span>” and “<span>voice-over</span>” inhabit different spaces— one is “<span>near</span>” the image, just off screen; the other is “<span>further away</span>”—each troubling the image in its own way. Multiple spaces, multiple “<span>bodies</span>” inhabit the sound track as it interacts with the image. The dynamic here extends beyond a single contradiction or confluence between “<span>image and sound</span>,” pointing to a plurality of spaces and bodies across the sound and image tracks.</p>
        <p>The connection between the voice and space is psychologically deep. We know, for instance, that “<span>space, for the child, is defined initially in terms of the audible, not the visible</span>.”65 Rosolato notes that (as yet blind) babies recognize their mother’s voice as soon as ten weeks after birth, where it takes five to six months for vision to become the “<span>leading sense in delimiting the <em>exterior</em> of the object</span>.”66 He stresses recognizing the importance “<span>of early auditory and vocal introjections; for it is only in a later stage that the organization of visual space assures the perception of the object <em>as being exterior</em></span>.”67 Though “<span>difference</span>” in the voice is recognized very early by the child, the separation of that difference from the self is only subsequently “<span>perceived</span>” in vision. The space of sound thus includes self and other as difference without the imposition of an “<span>exterior</span>,” which the image seeks to elaborate.</p>
        <p>In this light, Doane’s reflections on space in relation to the voice-off provide a springboard to an alternative way of thinking about the problem that the body constitutes for feminist film studies. The fantasmatic body that exists as the space of the film rather than “<span>in</span>” the image speaks of difference that the spectator/subject may sustain, rather than seek to contain through objectification, fetishization, and other vision-based scenarios of spectatorship. In making this claim, in exploring the ramifications of this “<span>other</span>” body “<span>in</span>” the voice, my intent is precisely <em>not</em> to set up (against which Doane rightly warns) “<span>a political erotics</span>” that “<span>overemphas[izes] . . . the isolated effectivity of a single signifying material—the voice—[and thus] risks a crude materialism wherein the physical properties of the medium have the inherent and final power of determining its reading</span>.”68 Nor do I believe that the voice is “<span>an isolated haven within patriarchy</span>,” a utopian signifier.69 Film is a form of representation, and voice participates in its discursive operations. However, the voice (and particularly the voiceoff) provokes a consciousness of heterogeneity and paradox that, rather than merely “<span>opposing</span>” the image, engages with it to construct contradiction. The “<span>space of a body</span>” inherent in the voice-off is not the body of “<span>the other</span>”—a female or male imaged body apprehended “<span>out there</span>.” Rather, the body should in this case be grasped <em>as</em> space, <em>in</em> space—indeed, in multiple space(s). As space in sound, which we have seen registers as both “<span>out there</span>” and “<span>in here</span>” simultaneously, such space admits contradiction. A body as or in this space bears this same plurality—this evocation of a continuum, of a collapsed yet ceaselessly signifying opposition. Difference is not only negotiated thus by the spectator in perceiving how image and voice produce space between them within the diegesis—it is sustained as a peculiar experience of the other as the self, the body as interior and exterior simultaneously. This may sound like a phantasm, and indeed Rosolato constantly invokes the example of the hallucination to help illustrate “<span>how much the voice . . . remains linked to a dynamic of the body and its <em>fantasmatic</em></span>.”70 This fantasmatic body emerges through the voice and the space(s) it invokes. In turn, the (multiple) “<span>spaces</span>” of <span>cinema</span> structure the spectator’s “<span>place</span>”—as precisely “<span>in</span>” difference itself.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Is the Subject Male?</h3>
        <p>The importance of a “<span>body</span>” <em>in space</em> for film theory lies in its relationship to that other “<span>body</span>” provided by the image. Neither supplants the other or dominates the signification either body may produce. We can no longer <em>understand the body purely in terms of the image.</em> The body, indeed, like all meaning in film, needs to be read between the image and the voice, alongside them, according to the spaces they construct, the subjectivities they sustain, the discourses they produce, <em>between them.</em> Doane has noted “<span>it is precisely because the body has been a major site of oppression that perhaps it must be the site of the battle to be waged</span>.”71 She stresses, however, that only to the degree that sound draws attention to its heterogeneity can it displace the body of the image—specifically through the disruption of imaginary cohesion through synch. Synch sound, throughout her article, represents patriarchal ideology come to roost in tying voice to image. Pointing to synchronization in itself as a (necessarily negative) proof of “<span>embodiment</span>” may lead us away from more desirable and productive possibilities, questions, and preoccupations. Understanding the coincidence of image and voice as synonymous with an objectified entrapment in a female body merely reconstitutes a logic in which “<span>contact</span>” with the image of the female precludes the representation of her subjectivity. Certainly, neither the voice nor the image “<span>is</span>” a body, female or otherwise. Rather, both represent and evoke the body differently: that is, the female voice-off foregrounds, exacerbates, intensifies, and poeticizes the heterogeneous signifier that voice constitutes relative to the image, but it may also bring the female body back into mind, as a place from which the woman speaks. This “<span>place</span>,” (seemingly a kind of space, if the former conjectures lead us in the right direction), as everyone knows, is anything but “<span>pure</span>” subject, nothing like the masculine subject who serves as the model.72 One cannot help wondering if we have been looking at the female subject all wrong—looking to conceive of her as if she could be seen, as if she were that image of a body, rather than a body in space, and, moreover, a (self)consciousness. The female spectator cannot “<span>identify</span>” with herself via a transvesticized “<span>objectifying</span>” male <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> that she puts on for the purpose of getting a little narrative action. At least she cannot know herself to be a subject in that image, though she can recognize an experience of her subjectivity: namely, objectification (for she knows herself to be an object in patriarchy). But in listening to the voice, perhaps, we can apprehend what the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> cannot see but may hear—the space in which she experiences her subjectivity in difference.</p>
        <p>Others have looked for a new way to cast the “<span>problem</span>” of the female body in film. Kaja Silverman’s view that castration “<span>belongs</span>” more properly to the male subject than to the body of the female, for instance, redirects the objectifying <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> back onto its source, relocating the problem as the “<span>male</span>” rather than the “<span>female</span>,” reversing the usual assignment of lack.73 Her revision offers a springboard for feminists and others to begin rethinking assumptions that prevail in the field about the female body and the image that appears to bear that body in cinema, assumptions that construe the special “<span>specularity</span>” of the female as pure fetish, closing down the possibility for female subjectivity. Silverman’s own efforts to elaborate the subjectivity of the female lead her in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em> to propose a “<span>phase</span>” in which the daughter desires and identifies with the mother. This “<span>negative Oedipal complex</span>,” she suggests, provides proof that the female subject can identify with femininity in a positive sense, rather than “<span>through</span>” the assumption of a male subjectivity that doubles back to objectify her.74</p>
        <p>It should be noted, however, that Silverman’s theorization of female subjectivity rests upon a visual model, as she slips from a discussion of the child’s relationship to the voice onto an Oedipal scenario of symbolic castration. As Silverman notes, her “<span>theoretical paradigm closes off the pre-Oedipal domain, both as an arena for resistance to the symbolic and as an erotic refuge</span>.”75 In Silverman’s view, then, a dividing line between the Oedipal and the pre-Oedipal (thanks to castration) exists, dictating that desire is possible only “<span>from the shores</span>” of the symbolic. She does note later, however, that an “<span>oppositional desire</span>” emerges in the retroactive friction of pre-Oedipal to Oedipal tableaux.76 Where Silverman sees this pre-Oedipal “<span>fantasy</span>” as regressive, positing its interest as residing in the negativity it provides the Oedipalized female (a sort of positive lack), it can also be viewed as a component of the constructive contradictions with which the voice is charged. Thus, where Silverman sees “<span>identity</span>” firmly entrenched with the latter stage (albeit inflected by the former), it should be remembered that the unconscious knows no time—both “<span>sides</span>” of the divide effected by castration engage the subject constantly. Where in her view the visual demarcation of sexual difference determines the place of the subject, there is room to explore how other experiences of self and identity, such as may be invoked by and through the voice, may interact, reverse, or confound the limits set by the gaze. Thus, the pre- Oedipal—which we may preliminarily associate with the space of the voice and a consciousness of the self in difference—may be just as important a factor as the Oedipal in trying to understand the psychic relation of both the female and the male subject to the cinematic apparatus and its representations via both image and sound. Indeed, the voice’s “<span>role</span>,” informing a different kind of subjectivity than what we associate with the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> alone, seems still far from fully understood. Again, it seems, a dynamic is at issue—one fraught with paradox, a “<span>dialectic</span>” wherein synthesis maintains difference.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Feminine = the Body = the Image</h3>
        <p>Silverman acknowledges that “<span>although on one level, [<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>] is a study of the female voice in cinema, on another it is an investigation of the verbal and auditory defenses by means of which Hollywood fortifies the male subject against his own losses</span>.”77 Silverman despairs of “<span>finding</span>” feminine subjectivity within the classical cinema, which she sees as an implacable machine that chews up sexual difference and contains the female on every register of meaning. For this reason, she claims, she can only “<span>approach woman as a symptom</span>” when looking at classical cinema. 78 By her own admonition, neither does she expect to find the female subject represented as such anywhere in the classical cinema, nor does her approach reflect a conscious effort to even try to address whether such a subject may indeed surface in any way. Her stated goal—that is, to find ways in which the feminine is “<span>contained</span>” at every turn and in every register in the classical cinema—expressly declines to consider ways in which the feminine <em>speaks</em> despite processes of containment or alongside them. In Silverman’s view, the woman (in the classical cinema) can never speak or see; she is but a “<span>foil</span>” for the male viewer, a “<span>place</span>” within the text where the male can project the recognition of his own “<span>visual and verbal subordination to cinema’s absent enunciator</span>.”79 Further, “<span>true</span>” subjectivity, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>, is always and only achieved via the “<span>authoritative</span>” exterior gaze. Since females have trouble assuming this gaze, and never do in the classical <span>cinema</span> (according to Silverman), the best subjectivity they can hope for, in her view, is a kind of “<span>counterattack</span>” wherein masculine subjectivity is displaced and frustrated via a radical separation of voice from body.</p>
        <p>Moreover, when discussing Hollywood cinema, she seems to retrench the very problematic of castration that she seeks to disable theoretically— and projects negative values onto the registers inhabited by “<span>femininity</span>” in these texts. For example, while she reads Michel Chion’s famously moody work on voice “<span>symptomatically</span>,” she reiterates the negative connotation he places on the feminine relative to the masculine (with regard to the voice and the body) and transposes it wholesale in proving her point about classical cinema. That is, she essentially <em>agrees</em> with him that Hollywood films represent the female voice-off as invoking, unleashing, and representing a claustral site of non-meaning and immobilization, an “<span>umbilical night</span>.”80 She criticizes his alignment of the localization of the “<span>source</span>” of the voice (the moment of synchronization) as a kind of “<span>striptease</span>.” However, she goes on to use his analysis as the foundation and support of her own postulation that the “<span>embodiment</span>” brought about by the “<span>rule of synchronization</span>” not only feminizes the voice but entirely disempowers it.81 The critical moment in which the “<span>speaking lips</span>” are revealed by the camera, in both their views, betrays the voice’s corporeal anchor, rendering the voice-off vulnerable and defusing it of its invisible authority. Interestingly, Chion’s description of the striptease dwells more insistently on the latent power and the instability of the voice-off’s relation to the body than does Silverman’s, who later goes so far as to describe the woman’s mouth in Hollywood <span>cinema</span> as the “<span>organ hole</span>,” a “<span>yawning chasm of corporeal interiority</span>,” which reveals only (discursive) “<span>impotence</span>.”82 Above all, Silverman limits the power of the voice by insisting that association with the body (or, as we shall see, anything connoting an “<span>interior</span>” space, like flashbacks) arrests and nullifies any subjective force.</p>
        <p>Thus a marked bias <em>against</em> the “<span>feminine</span>” riddles Silverman’s analysis of classical film and the voice, emerging most obviously in her complete rejection of the female body in film. Time and again, she points to the imaged body as a site of “<span>claustral</span>” containment, a “<span>contaminating</span>” influence, a constraining “<span>limit</span>”; moreover, the nature of this constraint relates to a condition of femininity expressed in the most pejorative terms. Though she considers that “<span>the female voice has enormous conceptual and discursive range once it is freed from its claustral confinement within the female body</span>,” Silverman insists that the female voice in classical <span>cinema</span> never meets the level of “<span>freedom</span>” necessary for the expression of such mobility and is, rather, always subject to some tainting influence of the corpus.83 Synchronization (a worst-case scenario, to be sure) does not merely “<span>yoke</span>” the voice to a body, but, in Silverman’s terms, always implies the imposition of a body that is, specifically, “<span>feminine</span>.” The body can be nothing else in this system—always codified as the weighted signifier of lack.</p>
        <p>In Silverman’s view of the classical cinema, then, the image that provides the visible signifier of the body always represents a potential destabilization of male subjectivity and even of male sexuality. To give a male voice-off a body, for example, is (in Silverman’s words) to “<span>feminize it</span>.”84 She postulates that “<span>the voice-over is privileged to the degree that it <em>transcends the body</em></span>” and insists that “<span>[m]odern male sexuality [is] defined less by the body than by the negation of the body</span>.”85 Thus, in a logic that increasingly separates the body not only from male subjectivity but also from male sexuality, we are left with a representational system in which virtually every signifier outside the entirely disembodied male voice-off (which Silverman admits is “<span>extremely rare</span>” in classical narrative cinema) comes to represent the feminine, but not in any positive sense. In this peculiar isosceles mirror, the feminine = the body = the image. All these terms are, in a sense, “<span>opposed</span>” to the male, whose subjectivity they potentially threaten. Not only is the female defined entirely as image/body, but these terms also reflect back in kind: the image is feminine and a form of embodiment for the voice; the body represents the very condition of the female/image. Since all of these terms are seen as restrictive, precluding representation of subjectivity in themselves, there seems to be no way for the female to speak. Pushing Laura Mulvey’s thesis in “<span>Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</span>” beyond the pale, however, there no longer seems to be anywhere for the male subject to find “<span>himself</span>” in this cinema, either. If the image itself is feminizing relative to the voice, then “<span>containment</span>” of the feminine within the specular female body seems a tenuous effect/project at best. The <span>cinema</span> described here seems a scenario of crisis rather than one of pleasure, as Hollywood “<span>erects male subjectivity over a fault line</span>.”86 Pleasure, in these terms, entirely sadomasochistic, lies in disavowing not only the female body, but the image as well, which anchors the voice to screen space and renders even a male voice corrupted.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Embodiments, Feminization, and the Ruin of Subjectivity</h3>
        <p>But the levels of corruptions are (in this scenario) relative, hierarchized, with heavily feminized categories sinking to the polluted “<span>inner folds</span>” of the text. “<span>Integrity</span>” for a voice-off, in Silverman’s schema, is defined in terms of its distance from the body (and the taint of the “<span>feminine</span>”/ image with which it is associated). She notes such disembodied integrity is “<span>exclusively male</span>” and suggests that more often voices-off suffer from some degree of “<span>corporeal encroachment</span>” or feminization.87 However, as I shall discuss more fully in Chapter 3, she claims that Hollywood finds ways to mitigate against this onslaught of femininity, creating slides by which synchronous male voices nonetheless come to bear the privileges of the disembodied voice-over. Thus, she concludes, “<span>At its most crudely dichotomous, Hollywood pits the disembodied male voice against the synchronized female voice</span>.”88 These films are a site of struggle, then, where in her view “<span>biology</span>” would appear to be destiny.</p>
        <p>The classical <span>cinema</span> she describes, a juggernaut, grinds up femininity, each film systematically operating to separate the disembodied male subject from the representation of his “<span>mutilated</span>” other. Classical <span>cinema</span> seems entirely programmatic—uniform, too—cut to order, to process difference the same way every time for the same results. One is struck not only by the gothic proportions of this ideological plot and its supposed efficacy and homogeneity, but by the idea, buried within Silverman’s view of classical cinema, that it is really all “<span>about</span>” the feminine. Ironically, in a sense, the male subject is <em>nowhere</em> in this cinema—a bodiless, transcendent spectator whose pleasure it is to confront endlessly and on every level the spectre of a femininity he supposedly finds intolerable. Even the male characters—if one follows this logic to the end, where the image is always “<span>feminizing</span>”—might thus be imagined to constitute surrogate females rather than relays for male identification.89 Indeed, synchronization itself infects every discourse with the weight of the body/female. If one looks at Silverman’s writing from this perspective, her insistence on the perils of embodiment seems overwrought and forced, not to mention deterministic. For my part, I am no more inclined to assert that the classical <span>cinema</span> speaks only “<span>of</span>” the female body than I am to accept the dictum that it speaks only “<span>to</span>” a male transcendence. The classical <span>cinema</span> must be looked at less mechanistically, from less restrictive paradigms and less literal psychoanalytic logjams. Moreover, it is vital to begin with a logic open to rewiring concepts that have begun to fossilize the woman in the picture and render her an absurd category that both saturates all representation with threatening otherness and remains exiled “<span>outside</span>” or trapped “<span>within</span>” it. If we understand “<span>identity</span>,” “<span>subjectivity</span>,” and “<span>address</span>” as of and for the “<span>male</span>” and leave only “<span>objectification</span>” and entrapment in the “<span>body</span>” for the “<span>female</span>,” we risk replicating and reifying constraint instead of breaking with it or questioning it.</p>
        <p>We should therefore question Silverman’s efforts to represent the psychoanalytic “<span>practice</span>” operated by the classical <span>cinema</span> as virtually concrete rather than metaphorical. Psychoanalysis, after all, is no more “<span>reality</span>” than is cinema.90 Both are systems of representation that may help us to understand how we structure identity and sexual difference in our culture. In setting these two against each other tautologically, however, a certain amount of warp reflects back in ossifying ways. Constraining the representational edict of <span>cinema</span> to psychoanalytic scenarios alone verges on a distortion of the complexity of not only the differences between human psychic configuration and the spectator’s “<span>place</span>” in the cinema, but within each of those systems as well. There is a level on which Silverman is primarily “<span>psychoanalyzing</span>” the <span>cinema</span> itself, rather than its spectator (à la Metz) or the film’s characters (à la Doane—though she does venture into these arenas). But in her analysis, Silverman frequently skips from one psychoanalytic regime to another to find whatever works “<span>best</span>” to help prove her point. She “<span>uses</span>” a strict Lacanian/Freudian terminology to expose the neurosis of the classical cinema, then moves on to theorists with less “<span>male-centered</span>” views of identity and subjectivity (Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray) to discuss feminist film. There may be a logic in assigning the more “<span>phallic</span>”-based theories to mainstream “<span>male-centered</span>” <span>cinema</span> and more “<span>feminist</span>” psychoanalytical perspectives to more alternative, women-authored films. However, shifting theories in this way reveals a lack of consistency in method: as Silverman seems close to admitting at points, the psychoanalytic scenarios themselves are ideological constructions that determine which readings <em>can</em> be made of the films.</p>
        <p>Where in Doane’s system there is some room for beginning to figure the body differently (in terms of space, for example, rather than image) relative to the voice or voice-off, in Silverman’s scenario the body is invariably equated with the image alone, and the voice is aligned with subjectivity only to the degree that it can escape all these negative entrapments. Embodiment of a male voice-off thus not only threatens what she calls its “<span>integrity</span>” but also implies an undermining of the codes of sexual difference that may be established in other ways by the image. To go along with her logic for a moment, however, it is still not clear <em>why</em> “<span>feminization</span>” of a male voice-off in this way must necessarily be read as a polluting, disempowering influence that closes down rather than opens up meaning. Surely there is something unusual and provocative, uncanny, in a “<span>feminized</span>” voice intersecting with a “<span>masculine</span>” image?91 But Silverman’s reading of classical <span>cinema</span> insists that anything feminized ruins subjectivity, which can only be male and bodiless. Her argument against the classical <span>cinema</span> thus rests on proving over and over that the “<span>female</span>” is always only a body, even when she seems represented as a voice. In Silverman’s schema, then, the voice is always referred back to some visual signifier, reduced to it through a logic that understands the image as the ontological center of cinema, one which determines and rules its aural “<span>accompaniment</span>.” She thus collapses the difference posed by the voice to the image, at least where classical <span>cinema</span> is concerned, asserting that its discursive power is disabled any time it comes into “<span>contact</span>” with the (feminizing) body.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Voice-off in Hollywood: Patriarchy’s Whisper</h3>
        <p>Silverman’s unequivocal conviction that the female subject is “<span>invaginated</span>” by classical cinema, her vast array of guns that point at Hollywood and fire upon its oppression of the woman, unfortunately effect, on a theoretical level, a kind of “<span>containment</span>” of the female subject itself. Her insistence that the female voice-off in classical <span>cinema</span> has no chance against the systematic occlusion of feminine subjectivity mirrors a hermetic inexorability that she assumes governs every film produced in Hollywood. She is persuasive in pointing to ways in which both the image of the woman and her voice appear to be “<span>[isolated] . . . from all productivity</span>.”92 However, her argument strains when, suddenly, she is able to envision a release of the ideological/psychoanalytic burden of the apparatus when it comes to a discussion of more contemporary feminist films. The standards by which she judges these more alternative film texts, when set against many classical films, suggest that the classical <span>cinema</span> has gotten short shrift in her book. Many of the strategies she applauds in these feminist films—selfreferentiality, the mobilization of a plurality of voices, exacerbation of a confused representation of sexual difference within both image and voice, underscoring of the reversibility between subjects, obsession with memory and unusual narrative structure, etc.—can be found (albeit, within usually less self-conscious implementations) in more traditional films. Indeed, one of the classical films she analyzes in depth in her book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Peeping Tom</em>, is itself a good example of how unorthodox the representational systems of more “<span>conventional</span>” films often are.93 Significantly, in a book dedicated to the female voice, she offers no sustained textual exploration of female voice-off from the classical period. She depends, rather, on the elaborate theoretical edifice she has constructed to keep the female subject “<span>shut up</span>” in the remote recesses of the classical texts, proving her points abstractly and punctuating them, so to speak, with an example here or there.</p>
        <p>The isolation of moments within a text wherein the female voice is tied to a body, or her body held in a gaze, do not themselves suffice to support the claim that “<span>she</span>” is “<span>isolated from all productivity</span>,” or fully “<span>contained</span>.” A convincing proof that a process of containment works in this way really requires a much more thorough analysis of a text’s movements over time, with great attention to the permutations undergone by the voice-off. Moreover, the implicit portrait Silverman presents of patriarchy here (via its representative vehicle, the classical cinema) comes across as monolithic, incontestable, absolutely homogeneous. If ideology, patriarchy, and subject relations are all so fully restrictive and efficient in closing off difference, it seems unlikely that women could speak or that films “<span>outside</span>” the Hollywood system (but still “<span>inside</span>” patriarchy) could signify differently in ways she suggests. Why is Hollywood alone susceptible to the vise-like grip of ideology, while feminists making films manage to wriggle through? Clearly, many feminist filmmakers have a strong critical awareness of the ideological implications of representation and struggle to open up space for the female subject in their films. But it does not go without saying that they are always successful, no matter how well-intentioned. Neither does it go without saying that Hollywood, albeit a capitalist, patriarchal industry, must always be unsuccessful (or rather “<span>successful</span>”) at constraining the female, if that is its aim. In Silverman’s approbation of the feminist cinema, the implied address is not a negligible factor in consideration: the films she discusses expressly look for ways to engage the female spectator. It seems important, then, to remember that Hollywood films were not solely addressed to a male spectator, and that certain of these films were hardly addressed to “<span>him</span>” at all. Within genres aimed at women, a privileged and emphatic address to a female audience is overtly underscored by the conspicuous presence of the female voice-off.</p>
        <p>A grand and provocative loophole thus emerges in the theory that Silverman weaves in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>, implicit in her assurance that the voice-off works simultaneously in opposite directions (depending on the discursive context) to “<span>objectify</span>” or “<span>free</span>” the female subject. Unlike the visual signifier, on which much feminist theory has more or less given up, it would seem that some hope yet remains for the female voice-off, which, in the right hands, still has something to offer the female spectator (or filmmaker). The female voice-off, as implied in Silverman’s writing, seems ostensibly “<span>neutral</span>,” merely a tool which, within one woman-friendly system, poses contradictions and proposes differing subjectivity, but which, employed to contrasting purpose in the phallocentric order, works “<span>just like the image</span>” to contain difference.94</p>
        <p>Thus, it seems as if the voice-off, in Silverman’s view, is <em>enslaved</em> in the classical system, and <em>free</em> in alternative cinema. To what, however, is the voice first bound, and from what, then, unfettered? Although Silverman claims it is the body that keeps the female voice-off from expressing subjectivity, her argument more fundamentally presents the <em>image</em> as holding this constraining power. The problem of such enslavement thus emerges as ontological as well as ideological. Though Silverman works to represent this problem simply in terms of discursive operations, she is not entirely successful in defusing the strength of her initial argument that the female voice-off cannot “<span>escape</span>” the mirroring “<span>encroachments</span>” of the body/ image/feminine. All three of these (apparently negative) values collude to bring down the voice. The first half of Silverman’s book strongly ties the psychoanalytic principle of lack to an ontology of the voice that represents it as inextricably embodied/imaged, even when non-synch. This ontology undermines the second half of the volume, where she claims the voiceoff can indeed be “<span>separated</span>” from the body and the image of cinema, no longer “<span>obliging woman . . . to assume a double burden of lack</span>.”95</p>
        <p>The ontology she has constructed in this book should be reexamined. As we have seen, Silverman relies on a specularization of the voice to devise a psychoanalytic portrait of its classical Hollywood “<span>spectator</span>.” She re-inscribes (for the voice) a constraint that is identical to the one Mulvey suggests the image operates on the female subject of this cinema. Redefining the voice in terms of the image misrepresents the specificity of its contribution to the cinematic experience. Collapsing the “<span>body</span>” into the image and understanding subjectivity purely in terms of separation from and rejection of both these terms is neither possible nor desirable. Disembodiment, within this scenario, becomes equated with relative subjectivity— both for the spectator and for characters bearing voices. Disembodiment of this order requires radical rejection of both real bodies and imaginary ones.</p>
        <p>The ever-troublesome body, of course, pertains to both the male and the female (though the female body tends to be represented as the “<span>problem</span>” faced by both sexes). Silverman points at numerous strategies by which classical <span>cinema</span> disposes of this body—or, alternately, pins it to the voice, “<span>yoking</span>” it and “<span>containing</span>” the subject who speaks first <em>beyond</em> and then, dismally, from <em>within</em> the image. Indeed, examples of such anchorage leap to mind: it is the rule, rather than the exception, that the female voice-off in classical <span>cinema</span> is associated in some way with a represented body to which we assume it belongs. Interestingly, within the scenario Silverman constructs, the “<span>nature</span>” or specificity of the female voice-off is understood as the same, virtually, as the male voice-off—the difference between the two results primarily in the relative prevalence of male voices-off that bear authorial power and in the tendency to relate, or “<span>anchor</span>,” the female voice-off to a woman’s body in the text. The male voice-off is generally discussed with regard to its reign in the province of the conventional documentary, where, bodiless, it defines truth and epitomizes knowledge. Silverman claims that such voices are “<span>exemplary</span>” for male subjectivity, attesting to an achieved invisibility, omniscience and discursive power.96 A search for an equivalent, “<span>pure</span>” female voice in classical Hollywood cinema, she suggests, is fruitless, and she dedicates the remainder of her text to discussion of feminist and avant-garde films that in her view move toward this ideal.97 Throughout this early article and in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic Mirror</em>, the stress is laid on <em>separating</em> the female voice from the body as a feminist strategy, and avoidance of synchronized sound that “<span>entraps</span>” the female subject and forces her to “<span>emerge within a discourse contrary to her desires, and to submit . . . to a fixed identity</span>.”98 The complete and utter disembodiment of the female voice-off is, in Silverman’s view, the only way to challenge Hollywood, which sees the woman as <em>only that</em>.        <p>
        <p>Her argument and terms re-inscribe an identification between masculinity and subjectivity; that is, to achieve a subjective “<span>position</span>” relative to the text, a female voice-off must be as “<span>disembodied</span>” as the “<span>disembodied voice-over</span>” we associate with the male “<span>Voice-of-God</span>” prevalent in conservative documentary.99 Understanding this kind of “<span>disembodiment</span>” for the female voice-off as synonymous with feminine subjectivity seems problematic, particularly as the subjectivity such male voice-overs suggest is that of the Father. By extension, it seems to imply that the female spectator/subject must emulate the male condition but from some undetermined “<span>feminine</span>” place relative to the image itself. Must female subjectivity also be defined in terms of the patriarchal ideal?</p>
        <p>Though in the analyses that follow I look to the voice-off as a signifier that speaks of sustained difference from the image, my argument simultaneously reclaims the site of the body as something more than visual object. Indeed, I question the logic that leads Silverman to assert (as she does with regard to feminist films) that “<span> . . . what is at stake in this disassociation of sound and image [is] the freeing-up of the female voice from its obsessive and indeed exclusive reference to the female body, a reference which turns woman—in representation and in fact—back upon herself, in a negative and finally self-consuming narcissism</span>.”100 While “<span>obsessive and exclusive</span>” reference to the female body is indeed a serious problem for feminists to resolve in representing that body, her choice of words seems to exclude the possibility of representing women in visual terms that do not oppress and fragment them.101 Moreover, along with an assumption that the voice-off can and should be “<span>separated</span>” as much as possible from the body in order to allow for a feminine discourse, her warnings against a “<span>self-consuming narcissism</span>” seem obliquely levied at the female spectator—in relation to textual processes she has already pointed out as tailored for stabilizing masculine identity.102 One has the impression, from her article, that it is less a question of feminists needing to resist the “<span>rule of synchronization</span>” at issue here, but rather whether feminists making films must abandon the female body in order to speak. I do not pretend to be in a position to definitively answer this question. However, I would raise some others in counterpoint that may open up and clarify ways in which this dilemma intersects with the female voice-off. Can the voice really speak, as Silverman would have it, “<span>outside</span>” the body? To what extent can or does a female voice-off signify “<span>differently</span>” from the image of the female? Along the same lines, what degree of dissociation (voice from body) engenders such (if any) difference? Can Silverman’s idea of a “<span>pure</span>” voice be observed or constructed? Finally, must feminists reject the possibility that the classical Hollywood films with female voiceoff (many of which have cult status and seem to bring women pleasure) bear witness to a communication of feminine subjectivity or address a female subject in an observable way? I contend that a female subject is at stake—a female subject <em>with</em> a body. This subject, I submit, can be vised through the heterogeneous signification of the female voice-off and the identification with a space of consciousness that it engenders. In looking to describe this space—and its placement of the spectator relative to the difference of which the image, the body, and the female character of film all speak—let us turn to a classical Hollywood film that is legendary for its sustained and evocative deployment of female voice-off, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</h3>
        <p>Kaja Silverman clearly recognizes that Ophüls’s film merits attention in its possession of “<span>one of the most extended voice-overs in classical cinema</span>,” yet she sums up the significance of this voice as more or less residing in the narrative relation it holds to Stefan’s desire to hear. She contends, “<span>. . . Lisa speaks to a male auditor (Stephan [<em class="notranslate" translate="no">sic</em>]) whose willingness to read her letter activates its discourse. In a sense what we <em>hear</em> is what he <em>overhears;</em> her voice is his mental construction. (In the same way, what we see is what he imagines, as the final montage flash-back makes clear.) Lisa’s narration is obedient to Stephan’s [<em class="notranslate" translate="no">sic</em>] desires, to his ear</span>.”103 Whether Lisa’s voice depends on Stefan’s “<span>willingness to read her letter</span>” seems debatable—the letter and the voice are linked to Lisa’s production of discourse and her power to fascinate Stefan (as evidenced by the trance that brings him to lose track of time, a trance that proves fatal). Describing Lisa’s voice as a “<span>mental construction</span>,” too, is problematic. From one perspective, this analogy serves well. As with many female voices-off that “<span>inhabit</span>” a foreign body, as Lisa’s voice inhabits Stefan’s expressive face when he reads her letter, it holds an implicit connotation of vicarious hallucination, or an imaginary excess. However, Silverman insists on an equivalence between Lisa’s “<span>voice</span>” and her “<span>narration</span>”—as well as on the “<span>obedience</span>” of these two to Stefan’s desires. But the voice cannot be simply identified with or held indissociable from the language it bears. Nor is it self-evident, in this case, that the voice appeals to and obeys the same “<span>desires</span>” as speech. In fact, if Lisa’s narration is to be understood as being in the service of Stefan’s desire, what is one to make of the power her speaking holds over him? He does not leave, as he intends at the beginning of the film, and though we know he is reading the letter, we experience the letter, as he does, as a voice—a voice that holds him in sway. Thus, I would question the statement that “<span>we hear what he overhears</span>.”104</p>
        <p>Lisa’s voice triggers a fascination that we share with Stefan—he is more obedient to the voice than it is to him. It interrupts “<span>his</span>” narrative, just barely begun and associated with the exterior social world within which this “<span>internal</span>” hiatus into reverie and nostalgia provides a radical break. We do imagine that Stefan hears the voice in his mind, and he is in his room—a space we come to associate with Lisa’s desire, not his. In fact, he seems unable to resist the voice or to distance himself from it as it resurrects his past in its own terms, ones unknown to him. Moreover, the flashbacks at the end of the film (where Stefan looks back to imagine what he never “<span>saw</span>”) function in a manner quite different from the voiceoff that forces itself on his consciousness. The images interrupt, again, the “<span>external</span>” male narrative that has picked up its original thread. They echo, visually, the lost time that makes up the bulk of the film, the time conjured up by Lisa’s voice, the “<span>internal</span>” narrative of the film. Yet they also may be understood as Stefan’s interpretation or resolving of the loss that Lisa’s voice has brought up and his effort (and the classical text’s) to symbolize and close off what her voice “<span>opens</span>.”</p>
        <p>“<span>Stefan’s narrative</span>,” as I refer to it here, opens the film proper as we are introduced to him and to the possibility of his death, as well as to the transgressive attitude that brings his “<span>word</span>” into question.105 He is singled out as the protagonist of interest in an explicitly “<span>exterior</span>” setting to which he returns once the lure of the letter has run its course. “<span>Lisa’s narrative</span>,” the story “<span>behind</span>” or “<span>within</span>” this first story of a man and his destiny, begins with the letter and her voice and is linked to the internal space of the house and to an interior journey of the imagination; her voice literally <em>accompanies</em> the unpredictably wayward consciousness of the mind she hopes to reach, for whom she often “<span>translates</span>” the past into her own terms, helping him (and the spectator) to “<span>read</span>” the images her voice triggers. Demarcating these two narratives, the “<span>external</span>” and the “<span>internal</span>,” I should note, is a way of describing a peculiar narrative movement, not an assertion of two distinctly gendered perspectives to the film. But it is important to remember that even on this overt level there is an effort to “<span>represent</span>” a woman’s enunciatory position, and even if this position is stereotypical in its association to the “<span>interior</span>” of the text, it suggests that this narrative presents itself as in some way “<span>shared</span>”—relayed between the two principle agents.</p>
        <p>This “<span>shared</span>” point of view has repercussions for a psychoanalytic reading of the female voice-off in this film. It also discourages a premature conclusion that the sound of Lisa’s voice translates as a mere aural reverseshot of her image that Stefan “<span>also</span>” imagines (even if we choose to accept that Stefan ultimately controls its signification, a position with notable fissures). Differences can be located, moreover, between her voice and her image for the spectator, for Stefan, and in the way the two characters relate to desire—differences glossed over, for example, in Stephen Heath’s “<span>psychoanalytic</span>” reading of this film. Heath insists on the image (of the woman) as the privileged signifier troubling a male <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> that orders the text: “<span>At the centre of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from [an Unknown Woman]</em> is the full image, sexuality as look, the <em>looked for image</em> . . . the perfection of the flawless—<em>whole</em>— body . . . of the female <em>as beauty</em> . . . the desired and untouchable image, an endless <em>vision.</em> . . . [At the Opera] Stefan turns in his seat trying to seek out Lisa’s face, the face of the woman who now—as always—is gone . . . with Lisa commenting in her voice-over letter-narration that ‘somewhere out there were your eyes and I knew I couldn’t escape them.’ . . . [A]nd so it goes on, the entire film a problem of seeing and knowing, of the image glimpsed and lost and remembered—as of <em>the</em> woman, the mother . . . the goddess</span>.”106 Given the unusual emphasis that the film places on the voiceoff, it is extremely curious that Heath describes the problem of the film as wholly one of “<span>seeing and knowing</span>” without ever considering, beyond the brief mention here, how the voice fits in to this theory. His point, that the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> and the image are privileged in the film-work, and that the problem is one of “<span>‘seeing’ <em>for the spectator</em></span>” seems based on an assumption that the voice-off is insignificant or merely literal (an unaccountable assumption for a writer as sensitive to the aesthetic and ideological permutations of framing and montage as Heath is.)107 It would seem that sound makes no difference—or that the difference it represents for the image is either too weak or too disturbing to be articulated. Fundamentally, Heath’s elision of Lisa’s voice as such drives home the point he wishes to make about the image—it also perpetuates a logic that looks to the ordering of a male-coded <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> as the basis for all meaning in film. It overlooks levels of signification that may allow for a less rigid conception of spectatorial pleasure than one locked to the mechanisms of voyeurism and fetishism. It participates in the ideology of the visible (and the patriarchal) it purports to critique.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Lisa vs. Stefan: Who Sees, Who Speaks?</h3>
        <p>A passionate debate has emerged over the years about <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>, wherein critics and theorists invariably come down “<span>on the side of</span>” Lisa/femininity or Stefan/patriarchy as the site of subjective structuration for the film. Significantly, most discussions of this film dwell on the immaculate and elaborate camera work that characterizes this Ophüls text and on the complicated flourishes of the temporality engendered by its flashback structure; very few address the equally prominent formal feature of female voice-off. Theorists who do mention the problem of voice in this film still tend either to reduce the voice-off to the words it pronounces (forgetting that while voice may bear speech/narration, its own ontology as a complex sound phenomenon should also be acknowledged) or look to ways in which the voice-off is “<span>folded in</span>” to the image, and thus rendered, supposedly, powerless. Gaylyn Studlar, in an article dedicated to masochistic performance and female subjectivity, merely notes that “<span>Lisa’s voice-over and her letter guide the narrative to [the] end . . </span>.” without delving into the performative aspects of the voice per se or of the seductive or leading activity of the voice which “<span>guides</span>.”108 Her article, instead, centers on narrative action and causality in order to display Lisa’s “<span>masochistic aesthetic</span>.”109 Lucy Fischer suggests Lisa’s voice “<span>is subsumed by . . . [mediation through] male consciousness; she is ‘read’ by him</span>.”110 Her essay conflates the voice with the text of the letter she has written, overlooking its potential signification as sound. Tania Modleski, in an otherwise compelling article, strangely stresses not Lisa’s access to voice-off but her <em>silence</em>, barely referring to the voice-off except to posit it as a cathartic medium through which Stefan’s “<span>hysteria</span>” may be cured.111</p>
        <p>Those critics who are expressly interested in the potential “<span>difference</span>” in the female voice-off of this film see its power as severely constrained. Silverman claims that the film “<span>situates the female voice at the interior of the narrative by contextualizing it within a written rather than a performance text</span>.”112 Because a letter launches the voice-off, she argues, no subjectivity can be attributed to it, and it is, further, “<span>enclosed</span>” in Stefan’s consciousness. Silverman’s insistence on denying any subjectivity to Lisa’s voice-off and her alignment of that voice with the “<span>interior</span>” recesses of the text as well as with the image (it is “<span>embodied</span>”) seem implacable. Its status as a voice is at every turn, in her view, compromised by the dominating image track. Interestingly, however, whereas Silverman claims that a letter is not a “<span>performative</span>” text, Linda S. Kaufmann’s work on epistles by women describes such writing as “<span>revolution</span>”—specifically in amorous letter writing by women to men whose indifference or abandonment has triggered this passionate, transgressive act. The furious letter writing of that “<span>other</span>” voice-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All This And Heaven, Too</em>—that of the repressed and ultimately murdered wife—richly illustrates Kaufmann’s point.113 In another text that strongly stresses the duality of sound and image in the Ophüls film, Susan White notes that Lisa’s desire for Stefan may be triggered by his embodiment of the phallic Mother through his production of an “<span>aural bath</span>” of music that captivates her transgressive imagination. White also stresses that Lisa “<span>resists</span>” visibility throughout the film in important ways (“<span>masquerading</span>” as feminine to attract the gaze, even while trying to “<span>deflect</span>” it in order to assume a subject position).114 White is more interested, actually, in the role of music on the sound track than in the voice-off, though she claims that Lisa “<span><em>narrates</em></span>” Brand, in an active, creative sense.115 White, moreover, strongly argues that contradiction permeates the film, which sets up “<span>the male-female, image-music, subject- object oppositions that produce both love and violence in the tale</span>,” though she insists these oppositions are “<span>undermin[ed] . . . even as they are produced</span>.”116</p>
        <p>The notion that contradiction structures this text is central to my own view of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter.</em> In this respect, I find Edward Branigan’s complex dissection of the narrative workings of this film provocative, even as I disagree with some of his conclusions. Branigan frequently refers to the voice-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter</em> as “<span>words</span>” that accompany the images, or alternately as Lisa’s “<span>narration</span>,” and he ultimately claims that Lisa’s subjectivity is sorely compromised by a “<span>hidden and powerful masculine discourse</span>” levied via the objectifying image that precludes her ability to sustain a visual point of view.117 Branigan’s analysis depends primarily on a discussion of point-ofview structures as they are presented by the image track of the film, notably in the famous “<span>stair shot</span>” in which Lisa’s vantage of Stefan’s late-night philandering is reprised “<span>without her there to see</span>” on the fated evening she herself becomes the object of his attentions. Branigan describes this scene as “<span>excluding</span>” Lisa, in the first instance because she has an illicit view that separates her from her object and in the second because she is “<span>no longer [there to] be a witness because she has become Stefan’s object</span>.”118 But Branigan’s clinching argument “<span>against</span>” Lisa comes though a meticulous tracing of a retroactive point-of-view shot—a “<span>reverse shot</span>” given prematurely in an early scene when Stefan plays the piano as Lisa swings in a reverie outside—a low angle close-up of his hands. This shot indeed seems retroactively elicited in a scene toward the end when, in medium close-up, Lisa dreamily watches Stefan’s hands on the keyboard as she kneels next to him at the piano. This “<span><em>delayed</em> or suspended POV structure</span>” as Branigan puts it, defines her as “<span>absent</span>” in the later scene, “<span>for now she exists only in <em>his</em> memory; her POV remains fragmented</span>.”119 That Stefan’s memory itself exists <em>grace à</em> the spiral reverie brought on by the instigating movement of Lisa’s voice-off is something Branigan never addresses adequately in his essay.</p>
        <p>As indicated earlier, I am skeptical about a project that represents female subjectivity though the same visual constructions (in this case a “<span>nonfragmented</span>” point-of-view shot) that have traditionally been ascribed to masculine subjectivity. Indeed, it seems far from incontrovertible that a “<span>delayed</span>” point of view can only be understood as one that elides Lisa here—for Branigan (surprisingly) appears to understand the temporal structure of this film in a strictly linear sense. The film itself, however, ceaselessly buckles against linear temporality (a characteristic of films bearing female voice-off, as we shall see). <em>As a voice-off</em>, Lisa is very “<span>close</span>” to this displaced reverse shot at the beginning of the film—having “<span>introduced us</span>” to the scene moments before and being Lisa’s aural corollary to the sound of Stefan’s piano.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as Branigan notes, within this early scene, marked dissolves blur the spaces Lisa and Stefan inhabit, enabling a traverse of sound from one space to another (just as dissolves mark the traverse of the voice-off in every movement from Stefan’s room to Lisa’s flashback memories elsewhere in the film.) Whereas Susan White sees the flashbacks as “<span>separating</span>” (Lisa and Stefan), the use of dissolves (the conventional effect of which is to link overlapping spaces) would seem rather to connect them.120 The repetition of the dissolves, in conjunction with the music and the voice, go a long way toward suggesting the simultaneous experience of two spaces at once—a simultaneity that the later scene renders acute with Lisa’s happy awareness of being there, where she once was only in imagination, “<span>under Stefan’s hands</span>.”</p>
        <p>Indeed, Lisa’s voice-off has a marked capacity to traverse time, to force connections (for Stefan, for the viewer) across the film to evoke a consciousness of her “<span>place</span>.” (The repetition of certain phrases over key scenes reiterates the mobility of the voice-off, its “<span>hovering</span>” spatiality, its strange verticality across the narrative’s trajectory through represented time.)121 If the low-angle shot is to be thought of as Lisa’s point of view, however, it is not so much delayed, as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">anticipated</em> by the young girl daydreaming as she listens to the lyrical prelude he plays. Looked at this way—as an imagined premonition of what she will see when she has attained her place of desire and made her fantasy come true—her subjective powers seem mythic, aligned not with a non-place but with authorship.122 Moreover, despite Branigan’s argument that “<span>what is deferred and finally denied in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> is a position for its heroine, Lisa</span>,” he admits that to understand the film’s complexity we must “<span>search for opposing, masculine discourses <em>interwoven</em> with feminine discourses</span>.”123 Thus his own reluctant project, to “<span>prove</span>” that Lisa is nowhere in this film, is subtly undermined, as he acknowledges that contradictory subjectivities coexist here. Indeed, I agree that heterogeneity is at stake in this film, and that “<span>the splitting into many voices is the voice</span>.”124 Where Branigan means to remind of (among others) the author’s “<span>voice</span>,” I am concerned to retrieve the phenomenon of the voice per se (and female voice-off especially) from this literary analogy, to examine the ways in which it appeals to the spectator, along with the image, to create a meaning <em>between</em>.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Consciousness and Sustaining Difference</h3>
        <p>In looking for a psychoanalytic model that can account for this notion of “<span>between</span>” as well as one that explores the possibility of contradictory and simultaneous subjectivities (something the voice-off brings into relief in a classical film text), I have found the work of Denis Vasse and Guy Rosolato compelling. Lacanians both, their perspective seems nonetheless to resist, to a degree, an automatic privileging of the phallus as <em>the</em> signifier of value, a privileging that also may on a symbolic level presuppose a higher psychoanalytic and social value placed on the visible over the heard.125 Their writings on the voice open up provocative repercussions for film studies and offer a refreshing rethinking of the seemingly inevitable conflation of “<span>difference</span>” with “<span>sexual difference</span>.”</p>
        <p>Vasse’s explication of the voice as a signifier of difference, and his notation of the various symbolic representations offered of it, underlie, in a fundamental way, Michel Chion’s efforts to metapsychologize the voice in cinema.126 Chion links the female voice-off to the Mother and to loss, noting the many cases in which the female voice-off leads a character to death (“<span>sa perte</span>”), calling like a Siren that compels the transgression of a limit that leads to the eradication of the subject.127 In pointing out this tendency within <span>cinema</span> to “<span>use</span>” the female voice to represent such oblivion, he offers no theory as to how this voice-off may function relative to the spectator. Nor does he explain the relation between this “<span>use</span>” of the female voice-off and others to which it has been put in cinema. To move toward this end, I want to offer my own examination of both Vasse’s work and that of Guy Rosolato.128 The notion, explored by both Vasse and Rosolato, of the voice as related to the Mother and to a “<span>transgressive</span>” union anterior to the Symbolic is of central concern. My interest in this pre-Oedipal domain is heightened by the concept of consciousness that Vasse elaborates in his discussions of voice. In thinking about subjectivity in consciousness and space rather than in terms of a gazing position relative to an image, I hope to outline a general “<span>psychoanalytic profile</span>” of the voice that “<span>speaks</span>” of a difference sustained. Bearing in mind my limitations (I am not a psychoanalyst, and I look at much of this theory metaphorically), I offer here a “<span>portrait</span>” of subjectivity experienced relative to the voice and female voice-off, before relating it back to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>.</p>
        <p>Mary Ann Doane’s admonition that “<span>[s]ound carries with it the potential risk of exposing the material heterogeneity of the medium</span>” should be recalled here, as well as her view that the asynchronous voice is particularly “<span>risky</span>” in this regard, since it is “<span>disembodied</span>” from the synchronous signifier (Silverman’s “<span>specific body</span>”).129 This risky “<span>otherness</span>,” she contends, makes the voice peculiar, “<span>uncanny</span>.” Her remarks coincide suggestively with Vasse’s work on the voice. He points to a split inherent in the voice—the voice is not the same as the words it conveys and yet cannot be distinguished easily from them. The voice, as it was before language, simply can no longer be heard—yet it is always there, “<span>in</span>” the words, in the “<span>grain</span>,” in, as Rosolato puts it, the “<span>flesh</span>” of the voice.130 The voice, then, is a site of potential loss, like the image: it signifies the illusion of its own plenitude, recalls an “<span>empty</span>” state that is its “<span>pure</span>” condition, a condition outside of the Symbolic. This “<span>voice beyond sense</span>” is a correlative to the gaze.131 As Vasse puts it, the voice (like the phallus, the “<span>rien</span>,” the gaze) evokes “<span>the pure and impossible materiality of the thing (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">la chose</em>)</span>.”132 He explains that “<span>the voice inscribes itself in the umbilical rupture . . . [making of birth] . . . the first separation and the first reunion. . . . Heard, [the voice] re-establishes the relation of difference that founds the unconscious <em>and</em> speech. . . </span>.”133 He continues: “<span>The umbilical is closure (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">clotuˆre</em>). The voice subvert[s] the closure . . . <em>traverses</em> it, without breaking it.134 [The voice] transforms the silent body into a sonorous space [that receives sound] and lets the speech of the other <em>resonate</em> . . . in a suspension of all <em>reason.</em> . . . The voice is neither in the order of representation (knowledge/ <em>savoir</em>) nor in the order of presence to the self (place/<em class="notranslate" translate="no">lieu</em>). It is not conceivable except as the passage (<em>franchissement</em>) that <em>founds the limit it traverses.</em> . . . It manifests presence, outside place, in the concept that is representation of presence. Outside of the concept of which the voice is the mechanism, there is neither presence nor knowledge. <em>The voice is the originary between</em> (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">entre-deux</em>) <em>of knowledge and place</em></span>.”135 A traverse, a passage, the <em>between</em>, the voice eludes the refractive ricochet that drives opposition and objectification in the subject/object relation.</p>
        <p>The voice, then, belongs simultaneously to the mother and to the child in the womb: it opens and closes the difference between them after birth. The voice always carries the suggestion of non-differentiation within it and simultaneously articulates the very loss of the fetus’s union with the mother, in the cry of birth. Like the umbilical cord, it connects subject to subject even as it separates them. Fundamental to Vasse’s description is this notion of a limit that is both articulated and traversed by the voice: the voice is both of the conscious and the unconscious, of the body and of the Other’s body (that is as yet only “<span>understood</span>” in terms of the voice, i.e., not a body as we inevitably “<span>imagine</span>” it, male or female). Voice, moreover, “<span>transforms the body into a sonorous space</span>.” Here, Vasse’s description opens onto Doane’s intimation of a body in space discussed earlier. The voice is the “<span>traverse</span>” itself that marks these differences and allows for symbolic difference while at the same time uniting them, identifying them. It pronounces the “<span>in-between</span>”-ness that makes for the subject’s speaking and triggers desire.</p>
        <p>The interest of these speculations regarding the voice relative to <span>cinema</span> seems to me not only to lie in the apparent intensity that can be inferred of the “<span>invocatory</span>” drive. Vasse’s theory also bears implications for the voice-off as symbolic of difference in a way that may “<span>trouble</span>” or destabilize the structuration of sexual difference effected by the image of the classical text. That is, if voice “<span>replaces</span>” the umbilical in this way and signifies for the child the articulation of separation and reunion with the mother, his description of this experience expressly enounces the child’s difference from her in terms of consciousness rather than “<span>identity</span>.” (I am taking the liberty of summing up Lacan’s mirror phase as involving this new sense of the self, wherein the small human first comes to appreciate her or his place in the Symbolic.)</p>
        <p>Vasse and Rosolato both suggest that the Father’s voice also immediately comes into play as the third term and functions not as the voice of desire, as does the Mother’s, but as the voice of interdiction. One might question, in fact, whether it is the “<span>voice</span>” of the Father that functions in this way or what the voice <em>represents:</em> language and the sense of the voice’s modulation. Doane, concerned to avoid an essentialist equating of the voice with female subjectivity, points out that the voice cannot be separated in a symbolic system from the “<span>politics</span>” that underwrite it. She warns that an “<span>erotics</span>” of the voice may simply lead to the articulation of another “<span>form of ‘otherness,’</span>” yet indicates that the “<span>place</span>” of the voice is a crucial feminist investigation.136 Her point, that the voice must be considered within the politics of the representation within which it is deployed, is well taken. My interest in signaling the heterogeneity of the female voice-off is not to suggest that it reflects an essential female subjectivity but to indicate how the “<span>feminine</span>” is retroactively placed onto the voice as a psychical distancing itself. In this way, however, the “<span>feminine</span>” may be more than the “<span>otherness</span>” Doane speaks of, or, at the least, may speak through it. In any event, any notion of feminine subjectivity in a culture that defines the feminine as unrepresentable might inevitably be figured as indirect, a translation brought into terms that the culture can access and symbolize. The female voice-off in classical films may often provide an example of such rendering; however, the “<span>voice</span>” in the female voice-off is often the best translation we have of what we cannot imagine— a voice in its “<span>pure materiality</span>,” as Vasse calls it.137</p>
        <p>Inasmuch as the voice speaks of the traverse of a limit that is not as yet based on the symbolics of the visible, and if it is “<span><em>the originary ‘between’ of knowledge and place</em></span>” (<em>savoir et lieu</em>) (my emphasis on “<span>between</span>”), or the unconscious and consciousness, it may be construed as evocative of difference that is not “<span>sexually</span>” or gender determined. (That is, difference here is not attached to an appreciation of the physical characteristics that distinguish humans.) Rather, this seems to be a peculiarly mutable difference, one that allows for the simultaneous consciousness of self and other in a way that does not yet imply dissolution for the Subject. Such “<span>consciousness</span>,” for the infant, clearly differs from the notion of “<span>consciousness</span>” we attribute to a socialized individual whose separation from the Mother has already been (un)successful. For the child, then, the voice would not only be perceived on a conscious level (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">savoir</em>) as that of the Mother, but also unconsciously as his or her own voice, the body a place (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">lieu</em>) where the voice resonates, “<span>speaks</span>.”138 Not only may the “<span>memory</span>” of the mother’s voice within the womb inflect the impact that the voice holds on the child’s psychical development, but this early consciousness of difference may not be traumatic in the same way that the mirror phase in some sense may be seen to be. The difference the voice traverses ought not to be described as an “<span>oscillation</span>” or as an “<span>acoustic mirror</span>” as it often is, but as the “<span>in-between</span>” that Vasse describes. Difference, in this sense, allows the subject to “<span>be</span>” heterogeneous “<span>as</span>” a voice.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Voice and (Non)Vision</h3>
        <p>What I earlier called the “<span>fascination</span>” of the female voice-off may be linked to this heterogeneity implicit in the voice itself and “<span>opposed</span>” to the “<span>male-centered</span>” image text of classical cinema. As we have seen, the spectator’s relation to sound differs in (at least) one radical respect from that which he or she holds to the image: the spectator cannot “<span>close the eyes</span>” to block out sound. The importance of the permeability of the spectator’s psyche relative to sound lies partly in the notion of “<span>blindness</span>” that accompanies it, as discussed earlier: what cannot be shut out also cannot be seen. In a symbolic system where vision is a privileged sense and synonymous with a kind of control, the “<span>blindness</span>” of the hearing Subject suggests a relaxing of the limits that “<span>center</span>” the seeing Subject. But another question surfaces here: can the Subject “<span>hear</span>” sexual difference in the voice as he or she sees it in the image? That most people seem capable of distinguishing between a man’s voice and a woman’s voice without seeing the person speaking seems to indicate that sexual difference nonetheless “<span>inhabits</span>” the voice as well as the body. But the sexual specificity attributed to the voice arrives with the cognizance of sexual difference—the androgynous connotations placed on women with deep voices and men with high voices seems to corroborate that such identification is a retroactive placement on which the psyche insists, particularly inasmuch as it also allows for a visual symbolization of the voice as “<span>part</span>” of the body.139</p>
        <p>The voice-off in cinema, as we have seen, is often “<span>placed</span>” in this way, more or less anchored to a body, especially if it is “<span>feminine</span>.” Indeed, given the mechanisms that suggest that the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> is male and that the text works to resolve the “<span>problem</span>” that the female body signifies, it hardly seems surprising that the female voice, too, is “<span>pinned</span>” to a specific signifier of difference, i.e., (as Silverman points out) to a specific female body. However, the problem is not this simple. For one thing, in Hollywood films, particularly of this period, the female voice-off is generally coded as more of a “<span>voice</span>” (or an object-voice) than the male’s, a richer signifier of this pre-Symbolic dimension, whereas male voices-off seem more transparent, coded as “<span>language</span>,” speech. One obvious sign of this distinction lies in the more poetic, less “<span>sense-bearing</span>” use of language prevalent in female voice-off, compared to the caustic, take-no-prisoners relationship to speech that usually characterizes male voice-off. (One need only compare the lyrical language of the female voice-off that introduces <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rebecca</em> to the dry verbal style of the male voice-off in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Detour</em>.) Many female voices-off, also, are expressly musical, both in their interwoven relationship to the score and in their carefully modulated, expressive tonality, as opposed to male voices-off, which tend to be matte, dry, ironic—the “<span>grain</span>” receding into the words uttered. These emphases are due to “<span>maximizing</span>” technical preferences (fidelity vs. intelligibility) in both recording and re-recording. The melodious quality of female voice-off moves it away from speech— puts it on the side of the “<span>unrepresentable</span>”: Guy Rosolato claims that a strong link associates music and the “<span>Voice</span>” as such.140 (Indeed, as Edward Baron Turk has suggested, there are even “<span>cinematic environment[s] . . . that [privilege] maternal incantation over male logocentrism</span>.”)141</p>
        <p>Thus, even if the female voice-off is often “<span>constructed</span>” with respect to the female body, it is also powerfully wrested from it. Female voice-off signifies in its own terms as a voice, as, in some respect, bodiless, reminiscent of that “<span>originary</span>” difference that is traversed. One may very well object in this case that the male voice-off operates in the same way, speaks of the same traverse. And, to a degree, this is indisputable. However, aside from the fact that the voice heard from within the womb is that of a “<span>feminine</span>” register (a register, of course, placed on it later) there is also the symbolic dimension that the feminine seems to take on relative to a state that cannot be imaged. Thus the alliance of the feminine to offscreen space may well be privileged in some sense. The female voice-off not only sees what we cannot—the “<span>blind image</span>,” the “<span>off</span>” screen dimension—but it is aligned with that which is not seen (that which cannot be seen) and the space(s) from which the non-visualizable emanates: the space “<span>outside</span>,” “<span>beyond</span>” the visible frame, the space of imagination, and the space of radical interiority.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Subjectivity in Difference</h3>
        <p>A return to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> assists in clarifying these abstract thoughts about the female voice-off. In what way, for example, does the voice of Lisa communicate to the spectator as such, as “<span>off</span>” and as female? The first time we hear it, the image has made the transition from exterior to interior space: Stefan is privileged as the focal character as we watch him take the letter from the hall into the sanctum that his room later represents in relation to Lisa’s desire. The camera movement expressively traces out this further movement toward increasingly interior space. Suddenly, the musical theme that will be associated with Lisa’s voice in this space begins, underscoring the melodic quality her narration will hold. A few other discrete sounds reach the ear—the sound of the water in Stefan’s basin as he washes his face, the ticking clock. Just as Lisa’s voice breaks in there is a hush, an anticipatory hum of muted strings and silence. This overture to the “<span>appearance</span>” of her voice and the quietness out of which it rises heightens the impression of its strangeness to the space it comes to inhabit.142 The grain of her voice is resonant and amplified for an effect of intimacy—rendered in “<span>close-up</span>.” Most important, we do not at this point know who is speaking—Lisa’s voice is unknown and anonymous, just as the title prepares us to find her. Magnified, lyrical, and invisible, her voice comes out of nowhere to speak the letter to Stefan. The quality of her voice here is at least as remarkable as the words. The words clearly are significant, with their melodramatic confessional message—yet, so is the emphasis on Fontaine’s celebrated voice, with its hushed mellifluousness.143 Stefan, indeed, can be said to be “<span>listening</span>” to both. He “<span>listens</span>” to what is written; we understand this as spectators to be his imagining of the source of the words, as his phantasm (and in this respect it is not incidental, in terms of the retroactive symbolization of the voice, that the voice he imagines is feminine) and also, simultaneously, as her voice-off speaking directly to him. Thus it is both his voice and her voice: it is a voice that replicates very clearly Vasse’s description of the “<span>traverse</span>” that bridges the conscious and the unconscious, knowledge and place. Stefan does not speak: he receives the voice, desires it, and in this sense “<span>speaks</span>” with it as it “<span>inhabits</span>” his image. The voice of Stefan’s interior monologue then, is Lisa’s, and “<span>feminine</span>.” More precisely, perhaps, the letter triggers what could be called an “<span>interior bi-logue</span>” between Stefan and Lisa, where her voice permeates, fascinates, and is heard “<span>in</span>” the words he reads. The female voiceoff here connotes hallucination, the dissolution of limits, the presence of absence, but, most important, a “<span>shared</span>,” heterogeneous consciousness (in the sense of these terms that I indicate above), one that the spectator may also assume.</p>
        <p>Lisa’s voice suggests images to Stefan, describing “<span>the scenes from our youth</span>” that were shared without his knowledge. It lures him further and further into the imagination, into memories he loses in having now to imagine them, memories that by the end of the film eclipse the reality of the life he has led “<span>outside</span>” them. Her voice leads him in a transition from what I will call “<span>the first level</span>” of Lisa’s narrative (in Stefan’s room) to the second, “<span>shared</span>” imaginary level (the “<span>external</span>” images of Lisa’s life that are also read as “<span>internal</span>,” part of memory or imagination). Lisa says, “<span>I believe everyone has two birthdays—the day of his physical birth and the beginning of his conscious life</span>,” and her voice changes as the image dissolves to the unloading of the moving van and the revelation of Lisa as the camera pans right. As a result of this transition into the second level, her voice must compete with sounds in the image and with the image itself, saying, “<span>I wondered about our neighbor who owned such beautiful things</span>.” She raises her voice to be heard above the din, and the voice thus bridges the two imaginary spaces—still “<span>in Stefan’s room</span>,” speaking to him, she is also “<span>in the story</span>,” “<span>the past</span>,” seeing the images she conjures up and hearing the clatter and commotion that threaten to drown her out.144 Thus, though still directed at him, the recipient of her confession of love, the voice as such is not foregrounded as in the former scene, where her voice seems to so fully inhabit the image and his thoughts. The grain is less resonant, flatter, and the narrative function of the words thus seems stressed over the imaginary relation that the voice articulates. This is a more “<span>ordinary</span>” voice, less saturated with connotations of enigma, music, and loss that characterized it in the previous scene.</p>
        <p>This “<span>ordinary</span>,” narrativizing voice-off continues and perpetuates the digression that the more “<span>intimate</span>” voice-off began in interrupting “<span>Stefan’s</span>” narrative. In short, it propels the narrative “<span>forward</span>,” but in the interior direction with which this voice is by now associated. The narrative progresses inward to the “<span>place</span>” that the voice is imagined to come from—the “<span>past</span>” Stefan must come to “<span>see</span>” and “<span>recognize</span>” a past invoked by the voice that cannot be shaken once he’s seen/heard it. The “<span>internal</span>” narrative that the incantatory sound of Lisa’s voice triggers, in this light, thus acts as a vertical movement such as Maya Deren describes in relation to her own films, though it is also circular, vortexical.145 Within the flashback structure, the voice arrives to remind of the “<span>other</span>” narrative (Stefan’s vigil with the letter and the duel that is its consequence) that is held up, waiting for this long associative spiral to return, recoil, allow the release of the first.</p>
        <p>The returns to Stefan’s room emphasize, on one hand, the emotional effect that this evolving consciousness of loss wreaks on him. On the other hand, they insist on the contradictory stasis that crucially links the internal narrative propelled by Lisa’s voice and the external narrative that the letter interrupts. The word “<span>stasis</span>” here is by no means meant to imply that the internal spiral movement is a dead zone, a “<span>claustral</span>” site wherein the feminine is imprisoned.146 Rather, it is an opposite drive to forward linear narrative movement. The bulk of the film, in this sense, is one long hesitation, where the spectator “<span>waits</span>” for the first narrative to return and the film centered on the “<span>male</span>” subject to proceed, just as Stefan “<span>waits</span>,” despite himself, for his seconds. The flashbacks within flashbacks to Stefan’s room underscore the stasis of the “<span>present</span>” of the narrative tense that allows the vertical signification of the “<span>past</span>” to continue its unfolding motion.</p>
        <p>Tania Modleski figures the film’s resolution as a <em>containment</em> of Lisa’s difference as follows: “<span> . . . just as Freud said that the hysteric is a visual type of person whose cure consists in making a ‘picture’ vanish ‘like a ghost that has been laid to rest, . . . getting rid of it by turning it into words,’ so too is Stefan cured when after reading Lisa’s letter, he looks back at her image behind the glass door, and looks back again to find that the picture has vanished. The ghost of femininity—that spectre that haunts cinema—has been laid to rest</span>.”147 Whether Stefan can be described as a “<span>visual type of person</span>” seems debatable, given that he is a musician and that he listens, as we do, in rapt attention to the voice-off. His vision, in fact, seems poor: he misrecognizes women, confuses one with the other. One should also question whether the “<span>spectre</span>” of Lisa’s femininity must be understood as relating only to her image. Modleski sees Lisa’s disappearance as equivalent to containment, and I dispute this conclusion. The “<span>ghost</span>” shots that reappear at the end of the film suggest that Stefan sees her rise up before him in an “<span>internal</span>” kind of vision, emphasizing that he cannot see her in the “<span>external vision</span>” that has always kept him from recognizing her. When he “<span>looks back to look</span>” with the intentionality of the male gaze, he sees nothing. Lisa’s “<span>spectre</span>” may then be said at this point also to relate to her voice, inasmuch as it is as voice in which she has been conjured up in Stefan’s mind—rendered in an imaginary space he cannot otherwise access.</p>
        <p>Moreover, one might well question Modleski’s subsequent assertion that a film like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> appeals to men and male critics because it “<span> . . . provide[s] them with a vicarious, hysterical, experience of femininity which can be more definitively laid to rest for having been ‘worked through.’</span>”148 Possibly, in such a film, male pleasure may to a degree coincide with female pleasure in the relation that the voice-off evokes, a pleasure that may override, or at least alleviate, the allegedly sadistic designs of the male gaze. One way of understanding this is to observe the degree to which male and female desire are identified within the text itself—how pleasure and desire are represented as both heterogeneous <em>and the same.</em> In this respect, the linking that the letter and the voice-off represents between Lisa and Stefan also proves instructive in considering the spectator’s own relation to the film.</p>
        <p>The letter and the voice, both bearing Lisa’s longing to exist in Stefan’s mind, are two relays in a kind of translation that the film offers of feminine desire. The letter, a form of discourse that in many “<span>women’s</span>” (and other) films symbolizes the difficulty for the woman to pronounce her desire directly, also is symbolic of a secret communication, a private declaration that nonetheless demands a response, forces something on the recipient— if only the momentary sharing of the sentiment in the mental reconstruction of what is written there. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em>, the letter comes literally from a radical “<span>beyond</span>”: written by a dead woman, it challenges Stefan with an absolute love he can only reciprocate in death, or madness. But the letter also belongs to the “<span>external</span>” narrative that is Stefan’s domain. “<span>Taken up</span>” from within this exteriority by the voice, it becomes Lisa’s narrative that then forays into the Viennese society that in many ways thwarts her love for Stefan. The two “<span>spaces</span>” of the letter, linked in this way, represent the traverse of the voice, the bridging of consciousness and the unconscious, knowledge and place, and allows, ultimately, for their confusion in a way that the text leaves unresolved. Near the close of the film, Lisa’s voice-off tells us, over an image of her son’s deathbed which pans to frame her own torso bending over the letter, “<span>Now I’m alone—my head throbs and my temples are burning. If this reaches you, believe this—that I love you now as I have always loved you</span>.” This shot is likely that which Silverman signals as “<span>anchoring</span>” the female body to the voice-off, thus constraining its potential subversion of the image. The effect of this shot is, to the contrary, to radically <em>disrupt</em> the segregation of imaginary levels that heretofore governs the structure of the film.</p>
        <p>As we have seen, “<span>Stefan’s</span>” narrative begins the story, then “<span>Lisa’s</span>” narrative breaks in with its internal flashback spirals. These spirals resurface into the stasis that interrupts Stefan’s narrative, her voice holding his story back to force Stefan’s recognition of their mutual loss.149 Thus, in the shot where Lisa writes (described above), these two narratives now seem simultaneously to “<span>speak</span>.” It is the only space represented in the film, other than Stefan’s room, in which the voice-off and the letter meet up. Yet it cannot strictly be understood as part of the “<span>internal narrative</span>” that the letter in Stefan’s room initiates, since the writing of the letter “<span>precedes</span>” the movement into the past for Stefan <em>in</em> the “<span>external</span>” space from which the letter arrives. Nor can it be considered proper to the “<span>external</span>” space of Stefan’s narrative, as it is Lisa’s letter as voice which signifies its own writing in the “<span>internal</span>” narrative linked to her figure. Lisa’s voice here seems equally the voice as Stefan imagines it in reading <em>and</em> that of her writing, imagining him reading. The letter, here, replicates the continuum of the voice, with sender and receiver taking up both positions with respect to it simultaneously, in the imagination. Like an “<span>acousticverbal hallucination</span>,” this is a moment that “<span>present[s] . . . the ambiguity of a confrontation between the ‘I speak’ and the ‘I hear.’</span>”150 A lover’s discourse, it “<span>goes towards the other</span>.”151 Barthes writes movingly of the solitude of the lover’s discourse and how this solitude, “<span>driven . . . into exile</span>,” becomes the site of affirmation. His description is singularly apt for the “<span>lovers</span>” in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter</em>, embodying both the terrible burden of solitude and the solace attained through a discursive gesture affirming it. Indeed, “<span>[the love letter is] purely <em>expressive</em></span>.”152 In Lisa’s writing the love letter (as she does here, in her letter, in her voice, in the very film), she “<span>engage[s] with the other [in] a <em>relation</em>, not a correspondence: the relation brings together two images</span>.”153 Two “<span>images</span>,” two subjectivites articulated in the traverse of the voice, sustained in the difference in the writing/reading/ speaking/hearing of the letter.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Middle Voice</h3>
        <p>This intersection of the letter and the female voice-off, the sense in which the letter is literature and the voice is a kind of writing, and the way in which both represent a passage of limits and the establishment of a relation within difference returns us to a concept introduced briefly at the opening of this chapter—the “<span>middle voice</span>.” A grammatical and literary voice, the middle voice articulates clearly the strong coexistence of “<span>contradictory</span>” subjectivities. Indeed, it leads, at the limit, to a kind of redefinition of subjectivity itself, for it opens onto possible ways of describing subjectivity within what we “<span>normally</span>” think of as “<span>the place of the object</span>,” by demonstrating agency within both the space of “<span>interiority</span>” and the “<span>passive</span>” voice.154 The Greeks, according to Hayden White, used the middle voice to “<span>designate the subject’s ‘interiority’ to a variety of actions . . . especially [those] informed by a heightened moral consciousness</span>.” The “<span>subjectivity</span>” articulated by this voice comes in part through this kind of consciousness “<span>and the force of involvement</span>” it implies for the subject.155 As opposed to an expressly passive/active split, where “<span>either the subject or the object remains outside the action</span>,” in the middle voice “<span>the distinction between subject and object is obliterated</span>.”156 Thus, a subject need not, as in the “<span>voyeur</span>” model of spectatorship, be “<span>exterior</span>” to the object or “<span>distanced</span>” (nor indeed, is the “<span>exterior</span>” narrative region thus privileged as the arena of agency), for a model of subjectivity does exist in which “<span>interiority</span>” connotes a special heterogeneous agency in which “<span>subject and object . . . are in some way conflated</span>.”157 Martin Jay notes, moreover, that the middle voice, “<span>if spoken aloud . . . would sound more like a hallucination than a communicative speech act</span>.”158 His description seems peculiarly apt to the ambiguous “<span>origins</span>,” multiple subjectivities, interior bi-logues, and the blurring of consciousnesses often represented by the female voice-off.</p>
        <p>The “<span>middle voice</span>,” a peculiar mode of address which I am claiming the female voice-off frequently expresses, seems to refute the easy alliance of the “<span>outer regions of the text</span>” with subjective privilege and authorship per se. It also suggests that the so-called “<span>inner folds</span>” of the film may offer a place to begin looking for subjective agency. Moreover, the middle voice relates crucially to the longstanding opposition of active/passive modes, in which passivity is always on the side of objectification, impotence, non-(self)expressivity. Freud’s discussion of the drives of love and hate is brought up by Hayden White in this respect, specifically in regard to the “<span>defenses of ‘reversal of an instinct into its opposite’ and ‘turning round upon the subject’s own self.’</span>”159 Freud sees sadism/masochism and the turning of the subject into the object as manifestations of these two defenses. Where usually these processes are linked to simple subject-object/activepassive reversal, White claims that Freud “<span>posit[s] a third position in this process . . . [in which] ‘the desire to torture has turned into self-torture and self-punishment, not into masochism. The active voice is changed, not into the passive, but into the <em>reflexive, middle voice</em>.’</span>”160 White goes on to note that this view of the middle voice relates to “<span>obsessional neurosis . . . characterized by a ‘turning round upon the subject’s self’ but ‘<em>without</em> an attitude of passivity’ (the subject’s attitude remains <em>active</em>)</span>.”161</p>
        <p>It is not my desire, in bringing up this psychopathology, to present it as a “<span>role model</span>” for feminine subjectivity, such as is represented in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman.</em> Though this may be a promising area of inquiry, and certainly as viable an allegory for feminine spectatorship as masochism, “<span>aesthetic</span>” or otherwise, my aim in bringing these ideas forward is simpler. 162 I merely wish to establish the existence of a psychological model in which passivity does not translate simplistically into objectification and non-agency, and moreover to stress the heterogeneous constitution of subjectivity as pronounced by the middle voice, in which both subject and object signify in all their apparent contradiction, <em>simultaneously.</em> White stresses that “<span>actions and effects [in the middle voice] . . . are conceived to be simultaneous</span>,” as opposed to the usual “<span>separation between the time of the inauguration of the action and the time of its completion</span>.”163 In this I see a strong explication of the prevalence in films bearing female voice-off to adopt a spiral flashback structure, in which past and present are often collapsed and rendered indistinguishable. The structures of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman, Secret beyond the Door, Brief Encounter, No Man of Her Own, So Proudly We Hail, A Letter to Three Wives, The Locket</em>, and others all bear this marked preference for temporal “<span>simultaneity</span>” over “<span>separation</span>.”</p>
        <p>Finally, the issue of consciousness raised by White with regard to the middle voice seems particularly relevant to the voice <em class="notranslate" translate="no">en soi</em>, in the way Vasse has described it, and to the female voice-off of cinema, which represents this “<span>pure</span>” voice, this voice “<span>beyond sense</span>,” most closely in film. The simultaneous evocation of difference expressed by this voice has to do not only with the “<span>force of involvement</span>” that renders subjectivity through an attitude of consciousness, as it pronounces its linking of the conscious to the unconscious, but relates also to the phenomenological problem of dialectical relations in general. For, as I am sure it is clear by now, the paradoxical dynamic of the dialectic is of crucial importance in understanding the work of the voice. Such a dialectic is implicit not only in Vasse’s theory (of the voice’s traversing of difference to engage the subject in space and consciousness rather than “<span>identifying</span>” (him) “<span>as</span>” a locus of sexual differentiation), but also in the theorizations mentioned here relative to the middle voice. Not only does the middle voice suggest an experience “<span>with more than one subject inhabiting the same space</span>,” but it also fuses subject and object, a primary trait of phenomenological definitions of “<span>self-consciousness</span>.”164 In self-consciousness, “<span>the conscious subject makes itself into its own object, or conversely, a particular type of object in the world grasps itself subjectively. Secondarily . . . selfconsciousness makes possible a fusion of mental entities which would be judged merely contradictory by the standards of ordinary logic</span>.”165 This “<span>fusion of mental entities</span>” is created not only between characters in films (for example Lisa and Stefan as they blur consciousnesses through the voice-off) but also between the voice-off and the spectator. Indeed, it is a question of “<span>multiple subjectivities</span>”—the “<span>many voices</span>” Branigan describes.166 And in this dialectical self-consciousness, the problem of “<span>synthesis</span>,” the transcendence of the impossible coexistence of contradictory subjectivities, should not be misunderstood as an obliteration of difference. Such synthesis does “<span>not do away with oppositions through compromise but preserve[s] and transcend[s] them . . . often in explicitly paradoxical form</span>.”167 Yet the opposites come together “<span>in such a way that they are no longer opposite in their former and <em>univocal</em> sense</span>.”168</p>
        <p>There may be something unlikely or even sacrilegious in bringing together such disparate notions of consciousness as those invoked by Freud, Vasse, Benjamin, and Hegel; yet all these writers point to a way of figuring subjectivity that slips out from the subject-object paradigm, a paradigm within which the “<span>feminine</span>” has been incessantly locked to a passive, receptive position that precludes agency. Moreover, the masculine has also received a raw deal, if agency and sadistic objectifying are always to be conflated with the male “<span>exterior</span>” position. In bringing these various and provocative figurations of another model of subjectivity together, my aim is to activate a criticism of the kind of “<span>subject</span>” that has become a monolithic presence in film theory—one without a body, all-seeing, strictly “<span>male</span>,” holding itself at a distance to maintain control over its “<span>other</span>.” The Subject, if one reads Lacan, is never as well-constructed as it seems to be in film theory—the Subject, in fact, <em>is not</em>. Lacan’s invocations of “<span>the subject</span>” are famously indirect, oblique, paradoxical. Conceived in a “<span>split</span>,” predicated on a “<span>gap</span>,” “<span>brought into the light of day . . . to clos[e] up, . . . vanish</span>,” the subject is “<span>at home . . . in the field of the dream</span>.”169 The middle voice embraces the contradictions on which the Subject is founded, reactivates them, and allows for the perception of paradox. What was radical, according to Martin Jay, about Flaubert’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em>, written <em>style indirect libre</em>, (often compared to the middle voice) was not the matter-of-fact discussion of adultery but the inability of the critics “<span>to attribute with certainty the shocking sentiments . . . to either the character or the author</span>.”170 The reading Subject, then, perceives the contradiction expressed in the middle voice as the concurrent activation of two (or more) “<span>subjectivities</span>” in sustained, contradictory signification. As a type of “<span>middle voice</span>,” the female voice-off similarly evokes textual heterogeneity and subjectivity-in-difference, as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> beautifully illustrates.</p>
        <p>In expressing the dichotomies of active/passive, interior/exterior, masculine/ feminine simultaneously, then, the entire film folds back onto itself, but not to close itself off. Rather, the bridging of imaginary levels as Lisa writes the voice and Stefan reads the voice reaffirms the notion of a heterogeneous consciousness in the voice, one in which desire in difference can be sustained without trauma, without the necessity of deferral, mastery, and containment. Read in this way, the film is atemporal in its temporal movement, a spanning of the voice, as represented by the female voice-off, across stasis that opens up a vertical depth of signification. The meaning of the film, really, is determined by the nature of the voice, its utterance and its reception bridging a narrative that represents in many ways its poetic form. The problem of the image, for this film then, should be viewed from a perspective that considers this evocation of a “<span>shared</span>” desire, an intimate consciousness of difference that may explain not only the symbolics of the story but also the quality of the spectator’s relationship to the film.</p>
        <p>A famous moment in this film has been singled out by many critics— understandably so, since it pits the voice and the image directly against one another. Over a close-up of Stefan at the opera, Lisa says, “<span>Somewhere out there were your eyes and I knew I couldn’t escape them</span>.” This moment need not be seen, as Modleski has described it, as a “<span>hysterical moment</span>” in the text for the male spectator to endure and ultimately repress—“<span>the passive, eroticised male . . . briefly glimpsed while being explicitly denied at the verbal level</span>.”171 Nor should it be reduced to a moment that figures Lisa as pure Other, the female image as Object, as Stephen Heath has suggested. 172 Rather, as Lisa’s voice speaks over the image of Stefan here, she expresses what is valid for both of them at that particular moment—the voice represents her, disembodied, “<span>looking</span>” at his body as she speaks of his “<span>eyes . . . out there</span>” trained on her. There seems no reason to place perspective in the figure of one or the other: both “<span>see</span>,” both “<span>are seen</span>.” In the voice, Lisa “<span>inhabits</span>” Stefan’s body as she does at the beginning of the film, speaking his and her own desire simultaneously, as it were.173 For, as demonstrated above, there is more than one body in the voice—difference “<span>there</span>” is also reunion, as this film suggests.</p>
        <p>Thus, the ending of the film may be viewed as something other than the ruthless boot-heel of patriarchy grinding the spectre of feminine subjectivity into invisibility and giving the feminized male a swift kick. Instead, Stefan’s fate may also be seen as his answer to the voice, his response to the letter. Our sense that there is something sweet in his tragic end does not seem inspired by the desire to see Stefan punished, in the name of the Law, by Lisa’s über-patriarch husband (who is anything but sympathetic at this point in the film’s narrative). Rather, the fatal resolution responds to the wish to see him share in Lisa’s suffering and loss, to recognize her by mirroring her self-sacrifice and thus to acknowledge her as his lost love. His death results, in short, from having heard her, finally, and from having stepped out of the external narrative associated with his <span class="notranslate" translate="no">gaze</span> to “<span>share . . . in what was never lost</span>.” His deflection is provoked by a voice he neither flees nor resists, a voice he might very well be said to desire. His response to Lisa can be taken, too, as an analogy for the “<span>dissolution</span>” proposed above relative to the cinematic subject whose sensitivity to the voice should not be forgotten. For if Stefan’s “<span>love</span>” for Lisa is inspired by the intimacy represented in her voice in reaching him from the beyond, it is also a love that agrees that “<span>suffering . . . grants access to the joy of being recognized</span>.”174 As he “<span>recognizes</span>” her, the spectator “<span>recognizes</span>” him. Such a relation may well bear relevance for the spectator of this film (and others bearing female voice-off) and suggests another way of figuring pleasure in pain than the model of sadomasochism suggested by theories of spectatorship centered on the cinematic image alone. It also hints that in the effort to describe feminine subjectivity, we need to start looking for a register of value that, while not denouncing or rejecting the body, may question further the valuation of the visible relative to other regimes of signification. The notion of a “<span>heterogeneous consciousness</span>” that the female voice-off in film evokes (and on which women’s films in particular may capitalize) offers a way of figuring the feminine in terms that do not reflect the flip side of the masculine, nor a biological essence, but a means of communicating or of relating through difference, sustained.</p>
