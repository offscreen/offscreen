        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Introduction</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">THE SUBJECT</h3>
        <p>What is <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory? What do we do in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory? <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorists make and verify propositions about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> or some aspect of film. They do so for both practical and theoretical reasons. In the realm of practicality, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory answers the questions asked by those engaged in making films. Cameramen might want to understand the gains and losses of the wide screen; a producer might want to think out all the ramifications of the 3-D process. In such cases, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory brings to light what filmmakers undoubtedly comprehend intuitively.</p>
        <p><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> theory is more often studied, as other arts and sciences, for the sheer pleasure of knowing. Most of us simply want to understand a phenomenon we have experienced fruitfully for many years. Certainly, there is no guarantee that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory deepens the appreciation of film, and in fact many students claim a loss of that original unreflected pleasure which all of us once had in the movie theater. What replaces this loss is knowledge, an understanding of how things work.</p>
        <p>This situation in which knowledge of an experience begins to substitute for the experience itself is a peculiarly modern phenomenon. One need only browse through the local bookstore to see how many experiences which are by themselves not experiences of the mind are being looked at rationally. Most current would be the phenomenon of man’s sexual life which has been scrutinized by so many manuals and psychotherapeutic handbooks. Religion, as well, has been replaced for many by the philosophy of religion or cultural anthropology, both of which substitute an activity of reason for one of another order. The whole field of psychology has as its goal the conscious understanding of unconscious processes. This list could go on and would include, of course, aesthetics, the rational inquiry into the realm of art, a realm which is not by any means an entirely rational one.</p>
        <p>To ask whether reason can aid experience is to ask a question beyond the scope of this small study, but it is to ask a question which we must always bear in mind, lest our inquiries become a replacement for our <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> viewing. I believe that those who study <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> are able to experience more kinds of films than those who do not study and that students of the art see the simple films, the films of their youth, in a fuller and more intense way. In any field knowledge can enervate experience, if the knower lets it. Yet it need not, for knowledge should be related to experience rather than be a substitute for it. This brings to mind the Socratic proposition that the unreflected life is not worth living. We must always remember too the schoolboy’s reply to Socrates: “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The unlived life is not worth reflecting upon.</span>”</p>
        <p><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory is another avenue of science, and as such is concerned with the general rather than the particular. It is not concerned primarily with individual films or techniques, but with what might be called the cinematic capability itself. This capability governs both filmmakers and audience. While each <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is a system of meanings which the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> critic tries to lay bare, all films together form a system (Cinema) with subsystems (various genres and other kinds of groups) susceptible to the analysis of the theorist.</p>
        <p>In America the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory most well known is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">auteur</em> theory which, properly speaking, is not a theory at all but a critical method. Like all critical methods it relies on certain theoretical principles, but they are directed not so much at systematic understanding of a general phenomenon as at the evaluation of particular examples of that phenomenon. In this case the object of study is an individual <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> or an individual director. As Andrew Sarris says, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">At the very least the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">auteur</em> theory can help the student decide which <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> to pay attention to and which to ignore.</span>” He and his fellow <em class="notranslate" translate="no">auteur</em>ists have developed a sophisticated way of laying out a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> or a body of films to draw attention to significant details and patterns which illuminate the personality and vision of the filmmaker. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Auteur</em> theory is also a way of ranking directors in a hierarchy of worth. As such, it may be very useful but it is certainly not a theory. Like its blood brother “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">genre criticism,</span>” it organizes our <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> history for us and makes us sensitive to certain aspects of it, showing us what movies we have valued or ought to begin valuing.</p>
        <p>Both these methods avoid the dangers of impressionistic connoisseurship which haunt the unsystematic critic, for they follow an organized approach and some invariable principles which can be applied to a series of films, one after the other. But even this is not theory in its pure sense, for its goal is an appreciation of the value of individual works of cinema, not a comprehension of the cinematic capability. We might call criticism “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">applied <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory,</span>” just as we call engineering “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">applied physical science.</span>” But we must always remember that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> criticism can be random and casual or, as in the two cases at issue here (genre and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">auteur</em> study), it can be systematic, progressive, and formal.</p>
        <p>While most criticism begins with some general theoretic principles, most theories begin with questions generated by individual films or techniques; but the answers must always be applicable to more films than the one which generated the question. In the same way, a botanist may be drawn to ask a general question by the appearance of a particular flower, but his finished theory must be applicable to more flowers than the one he first observed; otherwise he would be not a scientist but a connoisseur.</p>
        <p>The goal, then, of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory is to formulate a schematic notion of the capacity of film. It may be argued that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is not a rational activity and that no schematic description will ever be adequate to it. But this brings us back to our problem of knowledge and experience. When asked, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">What possible value is there in trying to account scientifically for film?,</span>” the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorist must answer that the schematization of an activity allows us to relate it to other aspects of our life. By putting an activity into rational terms we can discuss it alongside other schematized activities, be they rational or not. The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorist should be able to discuss his field with the linguist or the philosopher of religion.</p>
        <p>No one would ever equate a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory, which after all is merely an order of words, with the experience of a film. But at the same time who would deny the value of geology just because it reduces the phenomena of earthly substances to chemical and mathematical formulas? It is precisely such formulas which allow us to see the place of the earth in the whole of the universe. Similarly, the generality of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory gives us a way of understanding an experience in new terms, in terms which let us place it in the universe of our experience as a whole. No longer must our <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> experience be an isolated aspect of our existence. Some may cry out that by placing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in a larger world, by treating it in terms which enable us to cross over between it and other kinds of experiences, we destroy the uniqueness and sanctity of the experience of film. But most of us are happy to be able to think about and talk about that which we have so loved and continue to love. And most of us think of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> not as a sacred way of being with the world but as another variant way of being human, different from, but related to, such things as literature, religious ritual, and science. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory hopes to articulate this mode of being human, this cinematic capability.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">THE METHOD</h3>
        <p>We may expect that all <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorists will approach their subject logically, though we know that the logic of one theorist will differ from that of another. In his own way each theorist will pose what he feels to be an important question about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and, having answered that (or, in the act of trying to answer that), he will be forced to ask other related questions. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theories then are reducible to a sinuous dialogue of questions and answers, and we may compare them provisionally just by examining the kinds of questions asked and the priority given each question. Our study, however, would be trivial if we merely enumerated all of the questions addressed by each theorist and the responses given. Such a list would by itself never generate the comparison, contrast, and schematization of ideas on film.</p>
        <p>In order to compare theorists we must force them to speak to similar issues by categorizing their questions. Every question about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> falls under at least one of the following headings : raw material, methods and techniques, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">forms</em> and shapes, purpose or value. These categories, adapted from Aristotle,* divide the phenomenon of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> into the aspects which make it up and which can be interrogated.</p>
        <p>1. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The raw material</span>” includes questions about the medium, such as those which seek its relation to reality, photography, and illusion, or those which follow out its use of time and space, or even those which aim at such processes as color, sound, and the make-up of the movie theater. Anything which is seen to exist as a given state of affairs with which the cinematic process begins belongs to the category of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">raw material.</span>”</p>
        <p>2. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The methods and techniques</span>” of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> comprises all questions about the creative process which shapes or treats the raw material, from discussions of technological developments (like the zoom <span class="notranslate" translate="no">shot</span>) to the psychology of the filmmaker or even the economics of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> production.</p>
        <p>3. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">forms</em> and shapes</span>” of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is the category containing questions about the kinds of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> which have been or could be made. Questions about cinema’s ability to adapt other artworks lie here, as do questions about genre and audience expectation or effect. Here we are looking at films from the standpoint of a completed process in which the raw material has already been shaped by various creative methods. What determines those shapes and how are they recognized as valuable by an audience?</p>
        <p>4. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The purpose and value</span>” of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the category which interfaces with the larger aspects of life, for here fall all questions which seek the goal of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in man’s universe. Once raw material has been shaped by a process into a given significant form, what does this mean for mankind?</p>
        <p>Whether or not this is the perfect breakdown of questions about cinema, it seems to be a just and useful breakdown, and every theorist implicitly answers each kind of question. We can tell a great deal about a theorist by seeing which category of question most intrigues him. In any case, in each of the analyses that follow, an attempt is made to see the kinds of answers and issues each category of questions brings up. This way comparisons of theoretical positions are rather easy to make. No doubt this approach does injustice to some theorists, because it imposes a kind of logical schema on their remarks which may fit them clumsily, but it provides the constant perspective which will allow us to attain an overview of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theories, and it gives us the coordinates so we can begin to map those theories.</p>
        <p>While there are countless questions which can be catalogued within these categories, we need in fact be concerned with only a few. The reason for this is that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory <em class="notranslate" translate="no">forms</em> a system in which the answer to any one question can be seen to lead easily to the next question, and any one question can be rephrased in terms of another. These two propositions about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory are essential: 1. the transposition of questions and 2. the interdependence of questions. Let’s look at each briefly.</p>
        <h4>1. Transposition</h4>
        <p><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorists may begin with a question related to one category and touch the others only by implication. A theorist like Pudovkin was very interested in questions about the creation of a film. He discussed technical questions from the standpoint of the filmmaker. What kind of editing best organizes a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</span>? What kind of acting is suitable for a historical epic film? What should we do with the new invention, sound?</p>
        <p>Other early theorists were interested in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> from the spectator’s viewpoint: How does a spectator respond to parallel editing or to a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cinéma-vérité</em> <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> which tries to gain in immediacy what it loses in visual attractiveness? Some theorists go straight to the projected images themselves for their questions. What is the nature of film? What is its relation to reality? How are picture and sound related? Is <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> a spatial or a temporal art? In its essence what is distinctive about film?</p>
        <p>A single phenomenon may be studied from any one perspective or may be transposed and be questioned from all perspectives. For instance, Pudovkin’s question about the kinds of use to which sound <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> might be put could be rephrased to read: “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Will synchronous sound make the image appear more real to the spectator and thereby increase the illusion of the fiction film?</span>” This transposition can be further redefined to fit into the material perspective: “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Is sound more real than picture because it is the reproduction of an aural fact whereas an image is a representation in two dimensions of a visual fact?</span>” So even though two theorists may begin from differing perspectives, we can relate their views by transposing the questions.</p>
        <h4>2. The Interdependence of Questions</h4>
        <p>Not only can a single question be asked from different perspectives, but a single question can be seen to contain within it a number of dependent questions. The answer a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorist gives to a question which interests him can sometimes be extrapolated to serve all the questions to which it relates. This is how we can venture to guess, for instance, Munsterberg’s opinion of wide-screen ratios from his answers to the questions of color and sound. Color, sound, and screen dimensions are all questions relating the technology of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> to the art of the film. We can generalize from even the smallest statement made by a theorist about sound to his opinion of this larger, more generic question of technology. In other words, within each category questions can be organized into a hierarchy from the most general to the very specific. This allows us to move continually toward ever-more-general questions.</p>
        <p>Optimally we can take all of the questions a theorist asks and factor out the four basic questions which serve as our categories. 1. What does he consider the basic material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> to be? 2. What process turns this material into something significant, something which transcends that material? 3. What are the most significant <em class="notranslate" translate="no">forms</em> which that transcendence assumes? 4. What value does the whole process have in our lives? In the essays which follow there will be an attempt to organize discussion of each theorist into sections dealing with these four types of questions. Chapter subheadings are variations of the theme of each category. Occasionally two categories must be treated as one in order to preserve the particular character of a given man’s thought. But in every case theorists will confront the same kinds of issues about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and about its value and purpose.</p>
        <p>To summarize: by transposing questions and by following out their branches of interdependencies, we are able to compare the most diverse theorists, theorists who begin from different perspectives and ask seemingly different questions. If this were not possible, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory would become a mere collection of unrelated questions randomly answered by various men. But with these two propositions, that is, by seeing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory as a system, all questions and all perspectives are interconnected.</p>
        <p>This does not mean, of course, that all the answers given to the questions will be the same, or that all the theorists will have the same perspective or ask essentially the same questions. What it does mean is that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory is a logical enterprise and that, while we must note the distinctiveness of the approach of any particular theorist, we must at the same time be able to compare and contrast his views with our own and those of other theorists.</p>
        <p>In other words, we must examine not merely the questions the theorist asks (though again this will reveal much about him) but the basis from which those questions spring and the consequences they imply. We must see every theory as broadly as possible, that is, we must see it systematically.</p>
        <p>*Aristotle’s breakdown of the four “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">causes</span>” of any natural phenomenon (material, efficient, formal, and final) is developed in his Physics, II, section 3.</p>
