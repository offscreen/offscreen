        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Formative Tradition</h2>
        <p>Since ours has proved to be a century of criticism it is not surprising that theories of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> were being propounded before the cinematographic process was even twenty years old. Never before has an art been dogged so quickly by intellectuals trying to understand it or, more often, trying to set it properly on its way.</p>
        <p>The first serious essays about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> naturally sought to carve out a place for it in modern culture. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> had grown up like a vine around the great trunks of serious and popular culture. It had even begun to alter the culture’s view of its history. Yet it must have been difficult at first to separate <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> from the events it recorded, and more difficult still to see it apart from the established arts and entertainments on which it depended for its form and for its very methods of reaching an audience.</p>
        <p>The first “<span>theories</span>” sound more like birth announcements than scientific inquiries. Men who felt an immediate sympathy for <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and who wanted to see it blossom on its own realized that they had first to free it from the other phenomena which supported it and with which the public naturally associated it. This meant an immediate attack against the realism of the screen and against those who, like Lumière, were certain that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> had no lasting import beyond the events it could record.</p>
        <p>These theorists struggled to give to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> the stature of art. Cinema, they claimed, was the equal of the other arts because it changed the chaos and meaninglessness of the world into a self-sustaining structure and rhythm. During this epoch, comparisons were made between <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and virtually every other art. Poet Vachel Lindsay was the first American to publish a theory of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Art of the Moving Picture</em>, 1916), and he specifically showed that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> enjoyed the properties of all the other arts, including architecture. In France a whole coterie of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> enthusiasts incessantly compared <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> to music, concentrating on its ability to shape the flow and look of reality. Following the initial steps of Ricciotto Canudo, and under the banner raised by Louis Delluc, leader of the French avant-garde <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> movement until his death in 1924, this group not only wanted to see <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> regarded as an art but they insisted that it was an independent art.</p>
        <p>Innumerable essays of this period (1912–25) loudly differentiate <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> from theater. Most suggest that because <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in its infancy was economically obliged to record theatrical performances, it had never looked beyond the theater for its own essence. The avant-garde of the twenties stressed the qualities of music, poetry, and above all dream inherent in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> experience. Delluc tried to sum up his conception of the new art in one mystic word, <em class="notranslte" translate="no">photogénie</em>, that special quality available to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> alone which can transform both the world and man in a single gesture. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is photography, to be sure, but photography which has been raised to a rhythmic unity and which in turn has the power to raise and uplift our dreams. The articles and books of Germaine Dulac, Jean Epstein, and Abel Gance overflow with lyric statements about the uniqueness of cinema. Aesthetic propositions are advanced but seldom supported in a rigorous way. It was enough in the twenties to conceive and forcefully present new ways of seeing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (as “<span>plastic shape,</span>” or “<span>frozen time,</span>” or “<span>synchronized to the tempo of our daydreams</span>”).</p>
        <p>While poetic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory appeared in France alongside the first <em class="notranslte" translate="no">ciné-clubs</em> and the avant-garde ciné-artists, the Establishment <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> industry in Germany was busily creating the movement we call <em class="notranslte" translate="no">expressionism</em>. This movement, which takes seriously the formative dictum to transform daily life, had no real theorist to speak for it, despite the fact that of all the movements in the history of film, it lies closest to the ideas of the intelligentsia it stems from. Certainly we have interesting remarks of expressionist actors, designers, writers, and directors relating to cinematic method and function, but no extended expressionist <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory was ever formulated.</p>
        <p>When in 1925 the German movement lost its original power and the French avant-garde disintegrated, the center of advanced thought about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> moved to Moscow. Russia had begun its famous State <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> School in 1920 and around this school there developed heated and productive discussion. Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, V. I. Pudovkin, and especially Sergei Eisenstein are the names most often associated with this period. Nearly all questions pertaining to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> were framed as questions of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> by this group. Eisenstein’s ideas went furthest here, but we should never forget that his writings were composed in the context of a vast and vibrant atmosphere of debate.</p>
        <p>The end of the silent <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> triggered a great number of important essays. By 1929 the number of journals devoted to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory (including in English such magazines as <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Close Up</em> and <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Experimental Cinema</em>) indicate that a significant world community looked at <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as an artform. Aestheticians rose up everywhere to debate the new direction which <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> should take after sound had disturbed its equilibrium. All this debate took place in a definitely formative atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, the coming of sound seems to mark the decline of the great age of formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory. Nevertheless, by 1935 it was taken for granted in nearly all educated circles that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was an art, independent of all other arts, yet having in common with them the process of transformation whereby dull matter is shaped into scintillating and eloquent statement. If most of us still see <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in much this way, if most articles on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> still hold to this general perspective, it is in large part because of the powerful viewpoint propounded between 1915 and 1935.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Hugo Munsterberg</em></h2>
        <p>When Hugo Munsterberg wrote <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Photoplay: A Psychological Study</em> in 1916, he wrote without precedent, and perhaps for this reason his is not only the first but also the most direct major <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory. His mind was not distracted by the din of argument; nor was his memory supplying him with obstinate counter-examples, because <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was hardly sophisticated enough to try anything other than to satisfy those functions it knew it could handle. Since Munsterberg claims that he looked at films only for about ten months prior to writing his book (he had been ashamed to be seen in a movie theater), his visual heritage in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was obviously restricted. He tried to make up for this with the energy and thoroughness of the scholar by carefully researching <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and by studying its history as much as he could. Nevertheless he was clearly interested in discussing not the earliest cinema, but those wonderful story films of 1915 which evidently he viewed almost daily.</p>
        <p>Munsterberg’s book is divided into an aesthetics and a psychology of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and he was preeminently qualified in both areas. He is often identified as one of the founders of modern psychology and he wrote widely on the subject for the scholar and the layman alike. In philosophy his credentials are even more impressive. He had been imported from Germany to Harvard by William James and he eventually became chairman of the philosophy department, during the era not only of James, but of Royce and Santayana as well. He seems to have had a tenacious intelligence, and when in 1915 he turned that intelligence on the cinema, he wouldn’t rest until he had explained its workings to himself and justified its importance to the intellectuals of the time who thought it crude and silly.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">MATTER AND MEANS</h3>
        <p>Munsterberg’s book opens with a historical introduction, the fruit of his attempt to learn all he could about the medium. This section labeled as it is, “<span>Introduction,</span>” may seem autonomous and tangential to his theory, especially for the reader who realizes that Munsterberg’s reputation lies in philosophy and psychology, certainly not in history. Besides, Munsterberg follows a long tradition in scholarship when he examines the genesis of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> before performing an analysis of it. The questions “<span>What do I want to examine?</span>” and “<span>How did this get here?</span>” have a natural precedence over such questions as “<span>How does it work?</span>” and “<span>What can I do with it?</span>” But we should not be misled here, for Munsterberg’s casual introduction dovetails into the heart of his argument. What at first looks like a simple chronology of important events serves on second glance to summarize the means by which the institution of film, as well as any given example of cinema, can exist.</p>
        <p>Munsterberg’s history of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is divided cleanly between what he calls film’s “<span>outer</span>” and “<span>inner</span>” developments, between the technological history of the medium and the evolution of society’s uses of that medium. Munsterberg argues that technology provided the body of this new phenomenon and society has animated that body, forcing it to play many actual roles. Without technology there would be no moving pictures and without psychosociological pressures, these pictures would sit unprojected in attics and museums. It is society’s craving for information, education, and entertainment that allows <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to exist at all.</p>
        <p>Munsterberg’s introduction culminates in a hymn of praise to the narrative capability of film. It recounts the legend of a young <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> compelled in its first years to the slavish documentation of stage-plays, freeing itself inevitably but heroically to find its own destiny as a medium of narrative. This medium he called, in the language of his day, the “<span>photoplay</span>.”</p>
        <p>The history of film, then, shows an ineluctable propulsion from (stage one) the toying with visual gadgetry to (stage two) the serving of important societal functions such as education and information, and finally, through its natural affinity for narrative, to its true domain, (stage three) the mind of man. After this introduction, Munsterberg never again mentions any kind of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> except narrative cinema. For him, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is indeed mere gadgetry without narrativity. Only when the gadget worked on the narrative capacity of the mind did the photoplay come into being and, through it, the artistic wonders of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> we all recognize.</p>
        <p>Munsterberg was always more concerned with the spectator end of the “<span>communications arc</span>” than with the filmmaking side. It is interesting that Munsterberg never discussed the director or scriptwriter as a creative force. Evidently he felt that the impersonal powers of technology and sociology worked through filmmakers to give rise to movies. What they operated on, what filmmakers made <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> out of, was Munsterberg’s prime concern and startling inspiration: the mind of man. The first half of his book develops this inspiration. Cynics could quip that only an idealist philosopher like Munsterberg could possibly conceive of the mind as raw material; but Munsterberg would be ready to counter with an impressive array of concrete psycho-physiological evidence.</p>
        <p>Like the Gestalt psychologists, whom he preceded by only a few years, he felt that every experience is a relation between a part and whole, between figure and ground. It is the mind which has the ability to resolve this relation and organize its perceptual field. He ascribes the sensation of viewing movement to the displacement of a figure on its ground and mentions that we can, through willed attention, reverse that relation, altering our perception of the movement. The motion of the clouds and the moon makes the best example of this experience. We can, on particular nights, watch clouds pass swiftly across an imperious moon, but the next moment the moon begins to glide for us through a murky forest of clouds. All depends on how our attention structures the percepts.</p>
        <p>(figure)</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">A classic figure/ground dilemma.</h3>
        <p>Munsterberg had a hierarchic notion of the mind; that is, he felt it was comprised of several levels, the higher levels depending on the operation of the lower. Each level resolves the chaos of undistinguished stimuli by a veritable act, virtually creating the world of objects, events, and emotions that each of us lives in. At its primary level, the mind animates the sensory world with motion. It is well known that his description of the so-called <em class="notranslte" translate="no">phi-phenomenon</em> put him decades ahead of later theorists who would account for the illusion of moving pictures by recourse to the theory of “<span>retention of visual stimulus</span>.” Munsterberg characteristically went beyond this passive view to an active one in which the mind at its most primitive level confers motion on stimuli.</p>
        <p>He recognized that the retina does retain visual impressions momentarily after a stimulus has been removed, as when we close our eyes after looking at the sun, but he shows that this passive phenomenon is not able to account for the way we bring a series of still pictures to life. The phi-phenomenon does account for this by emphasizing the active powers of the mind which literally make sense (motion) out of distinct stimuli. Munsterberg describes this phenomenon by recounting some famous experiments in perception, but he never tries to explain it. The phi-phenomenon is for him a given. It shows that at its most basic level the mind has its own laws and constructs our world in exercising them. It shows as well that the technology of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> implicitly recognizes these laws and works its effects on the mind itself. The complex machinery (cameras, projectors, and all the processing gadgetry) producing intermittent still pictures has been developed to work directly on the raw material of the mind. The result is motion pictures.</p>
        <p>This single, basic mental capability was enough to let Munsterberg conceive of the entire cinematic process as a mental process. Cinema, for him, is the art of the mind just as music is that of the ear and painting that of the eye. All of its technology and sociology proceed from this belief. All inventions and uses for the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> have been developed to shape and create films out of the mind of man. It is the mind which is the quarry for the filmmaker and the stuff of movies.</p>
        <p>It seemed obvious to Munsterberg to describe all cinematic properties as mental. Besides the basic quality of motion, he notes that close-ups and camera angles exist not simply because of the lenses and cameras which make them technically feasible, but because of the mind’s very way of working, which he labels “<span>attention</span>.” Not only does the mind live in a moving world, it organizes that world by means of this property of attention. In the same way the motion picture is not a mere record of motion, but an organized record of the way the mind creates a meaningful reality. Attention operates on the world of sensation and motion, just as angle, composition, and focal length are properties a step above sheer recording of intermittent photographs.</p>
        <p>At an even higher level Munsterberg confronts the mental operations of memory and imagination which go beyond simple attention to give this world a sense, an impact, a personal direction. The filmic properties which respond to these mental operations are the various kinds of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> all of which confer on both motion and significant camera work a dramatic direction and organization. At the highest mental level are emotions, which Munsterberg considers to be complete mental events. While he never distinguishes, in this book at least, between the mind and its emotions, the latter must organize the powers and activities of the former. The cinematic aspect corresponding to emotion is the story itself, the highest unit or ingredient available to this narrative art, and the one which directs all the lower processes of film.</p>
        <p>Thus in ascending his psychological hierarchy, Munsterberg has carefully pointed to the material analogues in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> which relate to each stage of mentality. The primitive illusion of movement given to us by the mind’s operation on intermittent photographs is supplemented by select attention attained via angle, composition, image size, and lighting. Corresponding to memory and imagination are the natural resources of editing, which compress or expand time, create rhythms, and render flashbacks or dream scenes. Finally, Munsterberg claims: “<span>To picture emotions must be the central aim of the photoplay</span>.”<sup>1</sup> Since the materials of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> are the resources of the mind, the form of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> must mirror mental events, that is, emotions. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> is the medium not of the world, but of the mind. Its basis lies not in technology but in mental life.</p>
        <p>At last we can see why Munsterberg pays only fleeting attention to documentaries and instructional movies. They may perform valuable social functions, but they can never attain the stature of the photoplay which is a form based on cinema’s true raw material, the movements of the events of the mind. We can see as well why he felt color and sound would prove worse than superfluous to the cinematic experience. They are technical developments which don’t activate a new level of the mind. For him the technology of 1915 was already ideally suited to shape the greatest masterpieces of which <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> would ever be capable and to enhance our lives by thus fulfilling the goals of art. How different his position is from that of Bazin who, thirty years later, would claim that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> must be seen as an evolving phenomenon, perpetually developing an evermore-perfect technology which will serve unthought-of goals by giving us unimaginable forms of cinema. It never crossed Munsterberg’s mind that the purpose of the highest <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> could be other than the traditional purpose of art or that its form might not follow the established precepts of all successful art.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">FORM AND FUNCTION</h3>
        <p>Munsterberg was first and always a philosopher, an idealist in the neo-Kantian school. And it is the Kantian aesthetics which he delivers to us pre-packaged at the outset of Part II of his book. To use our system of categories, it was the value, function, or purpose of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> which first must have gripped his mind as he found himself returning time and time again to the movies in 1915. For him the experience of being lost in a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> story proved that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> was an art, having the purpose of art, and it is toward the aesthetics of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> that his psychology of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> tends.</p>
        <p>Following Kant, Munsterberg employs an entirely different kind of analysis when he turns from psychology to aesthetics. Psychology is part of a scientific mode of thought. It tries to explain aspects of what Kant called the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">phenomenal realm</em>, the realm of sense experience where things are linked in time, space, and causality. Munsterberg’s historical introduction described the epidermis of film, treating <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> like an object in nature. Part I moved to psychology because Munsterberg saw <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as an object for experience requiring that we relate it to the seat of experience, the mind. History, in short, described the object we usually call film, and psychology showed how that external object creates the internal object which is really the film. Together these analyses account for the “<span>phenomenal</span>” aspects of cinema.</p>
        <p>The second half of his book goes outside science to philosophy in order to account for the form and function of film, that is for the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">noumenal realm</em>. While science is able to show how a thing has come into existence and how it works in our lives, it is unable to describe the value of that object. For this we must go to philosophy and specifically to the value-philosophy and the neo-Kantian aesthetics which Munsterberg had practiced and promoted for forty years.</p>
        <p>Aesthetics plays an important role in the overall philosophy of Kant and an even more important role in Munsterberg’s system. The sciences of the phenomenal world can never get outside that world to the basis of life and consciousness. They are locked within a world of causality. Kant found that for science to be construed as correct or “<span>true</span>” we have to believe in the transcendence of certain logical categories that exist in the noumenal, not the phenomenal sphere. These categories are unprovable, yet without them all our science and everyday common sense falls apart. Logic isn’t alone in this noumenal realm. He also placed ethical first principles there which serve to justify our normal moral sense, giving us the ability to judge one action as better than another and, more important, allowing us to go beyond ourselves in so judging. Just as we demand that everyone accept the logical principles by which we make sense of the material world, so we demand that everyone recognize the transcendence of certain moral principles without which we couldn’t properly speak of right and wrong actions.</p>
        <p>Logic and ethics are joined by aesthetics to round out Kant’s inquiry into the noumenal. Here too certain innate and transcendent principles are shown to underlie our basic sensual life. We find ourselves attracted or repelled by various objects and experiences and Kant needs to show that this “<span>affective</span>” aspect of our lives is not completely governed by sheer physical causality, that we aren’t completely and passively at the mercy of our psyches and the random stimuli of the world. He argued that while most of our feelings and judgments are based on the pleasure principle and are therefore explicable within the normal domain of psychology, our experience of the truly beautiful places us momentarily outside of all considerations of personal gain or pleasure. We confront an object or experience for itself and we feel that it is justified in itself. This is why Kant calls the object of beauty an object having “<span>purposiveness without purpose</span>.” It looks perfectly designed, so that each of its parts work toward a magnificent whole, but we can do nothing with it except experience it. It is cut off from other objects and experiences just as we are cut off momentarily from the normal continuity of self-interest which comprises our daily life and projects. Both the mind and the object are free-floating during this experience. Kant says the mind is “<span>distinterested,</span>” that is, not intent on turning this object to use, while the object is “<span>isolated,</span>” held out against all the other objects in the world. We don’t look at it to see how it can aid us, nor to find out its place in the larger scheme of things. During the aesthetic experience that object becomes for us the whole context, an end in itself, a <em class="notranslte" translate="no">terminal value</em>.</p>
        <p>What pleased both Kant and Munsterberg was that this value doesn’t help us at all, gains us nothing. We have no cause to uphold it. Therefore, they reasoned, our selfless attraction to this value proves the existence of transcendence, proves the reality of the entire world of values. Materialists have always argued that logic and ethics are fabricated by a frantic mind unable to cope with the arbitrary world of matter and morals. Having to justify our common sense and our common morality, we invent the “<span>noumenal</span>” realm and claim that it makes <em class="notranslte" translate="no">the</em> world hold together, whereas in reality it is a simple psychological ploy designed to hold <em class="notranslte" translate="no">our</em> world together. Such materialists actually use psychology to explain the universals man senses around him. They try to account for the noumenal by the phenomenal. Both Kant and Munsterberg were sensitive to these charges and went to aesthetics to shore up the defenseless world of transcendence. They found that in the pure experience of beauty man encounters a transcendence which doesn’t affect him directly and which the psychology of the materialist cannot explain away. Beauty saves both Truth and Goodness.</p>
        <p>In the art object the mind suddenly finds in the world an object constructed perfectly for it, assuring the rightness of both the object and the perceiving mind, both of which escape for a moment the hectic minute-to-minute tension which exists between man and the world. For Munsterberg the isolated art object must appeal to the disinterested perceiver in all its uniqueness, first stirring the mind and then putting it to rest. Certain films, he found, fully accomplish this.</p>
        <p>Evidently the effect was so strong for him that he refused to believe <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> was an inferior art form. Those who claim it is a mere carrier of the art of the theater, ignore the fact that when we see a photograph of a Renaissance painting we crave to see the original and so are not really satisfied by the object before us, but when we see a good <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> we are satisfied and don’t consider it displaced theater. Our minds invade this object on the screen and are cut off from all other engagements. The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> then flows to its conclusion shaped in such a way that it <em class="notranslte" translate="no">sustains itself</em> away from the real world and <em class="notranslte" translate="no">sustains us</em> in what has been called a state of “<span>rapt attention</span>.” Instead of trying to use such a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> or even to comprehend it, we are content to perceive it for itself, isolated from everything else, valuable in itself. Such is Munsterberg’s answer to film’s final goal. He is so sure of this answer that he never bothers to argue for it in this essay. It is for him a fact of experience.<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>Aesthetic experience first strikes us in our contemplation of nature. When in our daily routine we suddenly stop for no reason “<span>to really see</span>” and enjoy that which before we had scarcely noticed, we are isolating this object or landscape from its background and we are isolating ourselves from our routine. This instance of nature pleases us not because it helps our lives but because it insists that, as Mikel Dufrenne says, “<span>We are made for this world and the world is made for us</span>.” Our experience puts us to rest and desires nothing more, even when the object is violent or strange.</p>
        <p>We cultivate aesthetic experience in art objects, which are objects constructed in the world for no practical reason. Often they are cut off from the world by a spatial border (a frame or a proscenium arch) or by a temporal border (we listen to a symphony in a hall from 8:00 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. and then we go back out onto the street). Artworks are objects, Munsterberg would say, following Kant, built to the measure of our minds, objects whose <em class="notranslte" translate="no">raison d’être</em> is to be experienced perfectly and out of all context.</p>
        <p>Munsterberg must show how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> can be such an art object. He proceeds negatively. First he indicates, as we have seen, that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is not a mere transmission channel for theatrical artwork. Then, perhaps too briefly, he tells us that neither is <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> a transmission channel for the aesthetic experience of the natural world. It is true that the filmmaker may provide a picture of Niagara Falls for those of us who have never seen it; and he may show us for the first time the beauty of a flower we have known but have never really “<span>seen before,</span>” simply by putting these natural objects on the screen where they are perforce useless. But Munsterberg would never claim this to be film’s total aesthetic capacity. After all, why do we need a duplication of nature, and one which cannot render the smell of the flower or the spray of the falls? Films of natural beauty have a practical purpose of whetting our appetite for the aesthetic experience of nature, but they can never substitute for such experience. They are at best like the photograph of the Renaissance painting which eventually entices us to the Uffizi gallery in Florence.</p>
        <p>Finally Munsterberg turns to the positive side of his argument. If a part of nature or a piece of drama is to function aesthetically in a film, it does so, he states, by submitting to the poetics of the screen, forming a new object, a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> object of contemplation. For Munsterberg this is a mental object, an object which flows and finds its rest according to the laws of the mind. Here we can recognize the coincidence of his aesthetic theory and his psychology of film. The belief that film’s only claim to aesthetic validity lies in its transforming of reality into an object of imagination has its echo in the psychological claim that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> in fact exists not on celluloid, nor even on the screen, but only in the mind which actualizes it by conferring movement, attention, memory, imagination, and emotion on a dead series of shadows.</p>
        <p>Not all films attain the height of becoming aesthetic objects. What must a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> be like to attain this stature? In other words, how must moving pictures be transformed into imagination? Munsterberg shows his Kantian roots most explicitly here when he claims that reality is characterized by the primary orders of time, space, and causality. These three basic ways of relating objects ensures their status in the continuum of reality. Nor can we even conceive of the world without them. Now the filmmaker has the means to displace precisely these three categories of experience, conferring on appearances whatever spatial, temporal, and causal relations he chooses. Although Munsterberg doesn’t say so explicitly, this view of the potential of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> brings it quite close to the world of dream. Naturally, Munsterberg would appreciate this rapport both on aesthetic and psychological grounds.</p>
        <p>The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> must follow a purely mental world, replacing the relations of appearances in the world with mental relations. The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> differs from the dream mainly in completeness. Whereas the dream may arouse certain fantasies and emotions, leaving us bewildered or trembling on awakening, the aesthetic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> will dispel all the energies it calls into play. It will take appearances from nature, re-order them in light of the mind, and, by doing so, stir our emotions. It will then neatly tie up those appearances, giving them a final order which at once asserts the priority of mental laws over chaotic appearances and at the same time completes the spectator’s experience in a way which leaves him lacking nothing. The spectator has given himself over to an object of the imagination and is left in the world but wonderfully cut off from its cares and demands. Munsterberg couldn’t be more succinct in summing up:</p>
        <blockquote>The photoplay tells us a human story by overcoming the forms of the outer world, namely space, time, and causality, and by adjusting the events to the forms of the inner world, namely attention, memory, imagination and emotion. … [These events] reach complete isolation from the practical world through the perfect unity of plot and pictorial appearance.<sup>3</sup></blockquote>
        <p>This practical aesthetic led Munsterberg to an advanced view of censorship. All material is suitable for film, he argued, even the most violent and prurient, so long as it reaches its proper conclusion, releasing the energies it has aroused. “<span>Unity</span>” becomes the catchword here as in so many theories of art. The absolute formal unity of the artwork ensures that nothing in it will directly affect our practical lives. The experience is entirely self-contained. Just as the space and time of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> are imaginary and don’t affect the space and time of our everyday existence, so also the causality at work in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> doesn’t flow directly into our lives. The sentiments we see on the screen, tender, violent, erotic, virtuous … all grow out of an interlocking System which ends when the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> ends. These feelings move us during the film, but the film’s unity allows us to contemplate them dispassionately as we are ushered back into the sounds of traffic outside the theater. If the film’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">form</em> is unified, then the film’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">goal</em> will be served and we will disinterestedly involve ourselves with an isolated and intrinsically valuable object.</p>
        <p>There are a number of serious questions raised by Munsterberg’s aesthetics, but they could be addressed to countless aestheticians since Kant. It is most important to note the consistency of Munsterberg’s thought. While some of his answers may strike us as short-sighted (his refusal to allow sound, color, documentary, spontaneity, etc.), it should be remembered that he did provide <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> with a carefully thought out apology taken from a respected tradition of psychology and philosophy, and that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> desperately needed such support in that era. Perhaps Munsterberg’s full impact is still to come. The reprinting of his study has provoked considerable interest in his theory and Jean Mitry, for one, has said, “<span>How could we have not known him all these years? In 1916 this man understood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> about as well as anyone ever will</span>.”<sup>4</sup></p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Rudolf Arnheim</em></h2>
        <p>Hugo Munsterberg’s ideas, no matter how advanced or cogent, had little effect on subsequent <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory. Rudolf Arnheim, many of whose notions are substantially the same as Munsterberg’s in <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Photoplay: A Psychological Study</em>, has on the contrary had a vast effect. As Arnheim’s reputation in the field of art criticism and psychology of perception has grown, so has interest in <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as Art</em>, the small book he published (originally in German) in 1932. Like Munsterberg, Arnheim comes from a respected intellectual school, the Gestalt school of psychology. And perhaps for this reason his argument, like Munsterberg’s, is quick and consistent. At the same time his absolute adherence to a set of ideas leads him to reject many kinds of cinema, making him seem today rather parochial.</p>
        <p>In the first sentence of his essay Arnheim limits his interest to questions of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as an art form only. For support he uses analogies from the other media: we pay no aesthetic attention to postcards (art), military marches (music), and striptease (dance). All media, he says, have multiple uses, only one of which is aesthetic; but it is this artistic function which generally makes us focus on the medium itself. Thus poetry returns us to words, not to messages, and painting focuses our sensibilities on line, color, composition, and other formal properties rather than on representation. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> art likewise returns us to the basis of the medium, rather than emphasizing the world it pictures. But what is this basis?</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">MATERIAL</h3>
        <p>Munsterberg had found this basis to be the psychological processes of the spectator. Arnheim wants to shift the focus to the material of the medium itself, yet he finds no way to reduce this to anything analogous to the simple materials of the other arts. He concludes that film’s material must be all the factors which make it a less than perfect illusion of reality.</p>
        <p>Most theorists have held that in some sense <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the medium of reality, even if it is a displacement of the real. Arnheim, however, claims that if this be so, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> cannot be art since there is no true opportunity for an artist to manipulate such a medium. The artist would merely have to represent reality, focusing the audience’s attention on what is represented, not on the means of such representation. Like instructional prose writing, such filmmaking would have its values but these would never be aesthetic values, since they are directed at the object rather than at the means.</p>
        <p>Arnheim then turns to a decisively brilliant approach. Since <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> can be an art only insofar as the medium differs from a true rendering of reality, he enumerates every aspect of the medium which is in some way unreal. These include: 1. the projection of solids on a two-dimensional surface; 2. the reduction of a sense of depth and the problem of absolute image size; 3. lighting and the absence of color; 4. the framing of the image; 5. the absence of the space-time continuum due to editing; 6. the absence of inputs from the other senses. Every image in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is fraught with at least these six types of unreal aspects. And it is these aspects which must be the raw material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art.</p>
        <p>It should be clear why Arnheim chides technological developments such as color, 3-D photography, sound and wide-screen. Each reduces the impact of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> by bringing it more into accord with natural experience. Arnheim’s position here is close to Munsterberg’s, for the aspects he has enumerated are not deviations from <em class="notranslte" translate="no">reality</em> so much as from our <em class="notranslte" translate="no">experience of the real</em>. Coming as he does from Gestalt psychology, which emphasizes wholes over parts, patterns over individual sensations, Arnheim treats the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> experience as unreal. True, it reproduces many visual facts on celluloid just as they would be seen on the retina, but our feeling for reality is much deeper than its retinal component.</p>
        <p>Let’s take some examples. Arnheim points to the fact that we see a rectangular table as nearly rectangular even when the front edge is pushed quite close to our eyes. Despite the fact that the retinal image of the table is trapezoidal (as would be any photograph of it taken from this perspective) our mind compensates for the distortion. Our vision, in other words, is not a mere result of retinal stimulation, but involves an entire “<span>field</span>” of perceptions, associations, and memory. In this case we aren’t seeing badly; we are actually seeing more than our eyes can tell us because vision is a complete mental operation of which retinal stimulation comprises but a part. Objects diminish in size by the square root of their distance from us. Our mind compensates for this to a large extent. But the photograph does not so compensate, giving us an image of a man’s foot, Arnheim says, larger than his head if it is stretched out in front of him. When examining a photograph, our mind fails to compensate for this effect, since the photograph is a two-dimensional object. It is this which makes photographic composition so different from mere arrangement of figures. Composition in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> or photography is a function of this visual fact or inadequacy. While being true to the mathematically real, photography is false to the psychologically real.</p>
        <p>Arnheim’s notion of the frame as an organizing principle in film, his concept of the space-time continuum, his insistence that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is abstract because it fails to provide inputs from our senses of taste, touch, and smell are other instances where meaning is seen to reside in a <em class="notranslte" translate="no">pattern</em> of stimuli rather than in individual stimuli themselves. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> may mechanically record the sensations which the retina gathers but it does so mindlessly, consequently non-representationally. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> art is based on the manipulation of the technically visible, not the humanly visual.</p>
        <p>These are just some of the reasons for the technical limitations of representationalism which allow us to experience the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">medium</em> even as we try to get lost in the illusion of reality. Arnheim holds that the sum of these limitations is the raw material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art, for it is only these which an artist can control and manipulate for his own expressive purposes. Many people have balked at this notion of film’s raw material. The very term “<span>technical limitations of representationalism</span>” sounds unlikely when placed beside terms like “<span>sound,</span>” “<span>stone,</span>” “<span>gesture,</span>” “<span>color,</span>” which might be taken as raw materials for some of the other arts. Not only is it a clumsy term; it contains within it the admission that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> strives to be representational. This drive toward realism is what André Bazin has called “<span>the myth of total cinema,</span>” a psychological force at the heart of all of us pushing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> toward perfect illusionism. For Arnheim, this drive is profane and must be checked and dammed up if we are ever to be able to use this medium for higher purposes. The limitations of illusionism are the means by which we recognize the medium at all and are able to treat a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> rather than as reality. These limitations are also the fabric of the medium.</p>
        <p>(figure)</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Photograph by Joe Heumann</em>.</h3>
        <p>Although Arnheim doesn’t say so, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art differs vastly from the other arts on this question of raw material. Music, for instance, is sound which has become conscious of itself and of its own properties, and has been taken out of the world, so to speak, in order to be built into a mental object. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> art, on the other hand, is the self-conscious use not of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">something</em> in the world (sound, stone, gesture, etc.) but of a <em class="notranslte" translate="no">process</em> we use to represent the world. In other words, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art is based on a process, or more accurately, on the retarding of a process.</p>
        <p>We might think of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> process as a window through which we are able to see the world. Arnheim would have us turn this window at an angle until the glass begins to refract the light, distorting what is beyond it while revealing its own properties. Suddenly we become aware of the frame of the glass, of its texture, of the kinds of light it allows to pass, and so on. Nonetheless we would never be aware of these qualities if we weren’t trying to look through the window. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> art is a product of the tension between representation and distortion. It is based not on the aesthetic use of something in the world but on the aesthetic use of something which gives us the world.</p>
        <p>Arnheim never analyzes the implications of this difference of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> from traditional art, a difference which will become the cornerstone of Bazin’s theory. Arnheim’s is necessarily a negative theory based as it is upon a notion of suppression: we must suppress the filmic process of representation in favor of the artistic process of expression. We can do this because the cinematic process has its own peculiarities. It is not so much a window as a prism.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">THE CREATIVE USE OF THE MEDIUM</h3>
        <p>The next step for Arnheim is simple, and it is one for which his studies in art theory have prepared him. Having defined the raw material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as aspects of its technology, he can elaborate the artistic effects associated with each aspect or limitation. This he does with a store of examples from artistically successful films. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> artists are aware of the unreality of the images they create and they exploit these limitations, forcing the spectator to see not just the object on the screen but the object carefully delimited via the medium. I have already alluded to composition in depth as a function of the two-dimensionality of the picture. Likewise, the frame which restricts the spectator’s view can be used by the artist to organize and direct our perception of the object. For each limitation of natural perception there is a gain for potential aesthetic perception, and Arnheim is quick to list such gains. In addition there are specifically filmic possibilities which no one would associate with real perception: fast and slow motion; fades, dissolves, superimpositions; backward motion, the use of still photography, distortions through focus and filter.</p>
        <p>Is Arnheim trying to create a dictionary of cinematic art? If such an approach is valid, every manipulative feature of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> could be described, together with suggestions of the meaning of such manipulation (e.g., the worm’s-eye view suggests weight or forcefulness; the head-on telephoto shot of someone running connotes the futility or arduousness of his effort). Countless handbooks to visual literacy have been written on the basis of Arnheim’s work, each hoping to equip viewers with an understanding of what the filmmaker is saying through his special treatment of a subject. Such introductions are often valuable in that they focus the uninitiated viewer’s attention on aspects of the medium he had formerly “<span>not seen,</span>” but they may also promote an impoverished view of cinema. There are, by Arnheim’s reasoning, a finite number of limitations for the artist to manipulate; and while there are numerous ways of manipulating some of them, a list of possible “<span>artistic effects</span>” is really quite manageable. Must we then believe that every image is comprised of a represented object (noun) or action (verb) qualified by artistic effects (adjectives and adverbs)? Must we think of every <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as something seen through a prism which had been carefully turned by the filmmaker in order to distort and color whatever he is showing?</p>
        <p>The sterility of this view overshadows its convenience. Does any other art merely “<span>comment on</span>” or color the world? Perhaps Arnheim has prompted such a view with his definition of film’s raw material. We have noted that film’s material seems to differ in kind from the materials of the other arts. His view that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> becomes art when the filmic process of representing the world is retarded nevertheless keeps <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art dependent on representation. The other arts lift their material out of the world and freely play with it; <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> would seem to be condemned to commenting on the world because its material is not material in the world at all, but a <em class="notranslte" translate="no">process</em> which was invented to represent the world and is unthinkable apart from that world.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> FORM</h3>
        <p>While Arnheim’s prescriptions for the artistic use of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> have been widely adopted, his notions of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as an art form are seldom taken seriously. But it is only due to his strict ideas about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form that Arnheim is redeemed and stands above his countless imitators who seem interested only in cataloguing visual techniques and effects. They are unable to show how artistic <em class="notranslte" translate="no">effects</em> are capable of producing <em class="notranslte" translate="no">art</em>. Arnheim’s commitment to Gestalt psychology gives him an advantage here.</p>
        <p>He discloses his Gestalt heritage in his Preface when he employs the term <em class="notranslte" translate="no">impurities</em>in relation to the form of films. And it is this idea which returns in the last essay of the book, “<span>A New Laocoön</span>.” For Arnheim, every medium, when used for artistic purposes, draws attention away from the object which the medium conveys and focuses it on the characteristics of the medium itself. Further, every medium proceeds by means of a central sensory nexus: music is the medium of sound, dance of gesture, poetry of words, and so on.</p>
        <p>The nexus becomes a symbolic language to be manipulated by the artist, and the artist must learn to organize this physical material so that his vision or idea shines through. Even if he wants to duplicate aspects of the physical world, he must study his medium diligently so that he can successfully translate his perception of the world into the proper codes of his medium. A painter looks onto a pastoral <span class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</span> with cows and farm buildings; then he looks at his palette and canvas; finally, after much trial and error, and a heavy reliance on tricks learned from other artists, he splashes the proper blotches of oil onto the canvas and produces relations which everyone will marvel at as being so true to reality. He <em class="notranslte" translate="no">transmits</em> nothing; rather he <em class="notranslte" translate="no">translates</em> one kind of perception into the conventions of his medium. If his goal is the expression of an inner state or emotion he must proceed in the same way. There is no shortcut through the medium.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p>As artist after artist toys with this material nexus, experiences are quickly accumulated. One learns that some things cannot be well translated into music or sculpture. More important, one learns that the medium is subtlest and most interesting when it adopts certain concentrated or pure shapes. Years of attention paid to the medium should have as an effect the progressive purifying of the medium, so that music in an advanced stage, for example, should be freed from references (lyrics) and theatricalities (performance characteristics) and should render up pure sound. In other words, the aesthetic capacity of its nature seeks a simplification of chaos and at its best finds a realm of purity in the heart of a medium.</p>
        <p>While every use of a medium is conventional (i.e., a translation, not a transmission), some conventions are more natural to a given medium than others because a medium has definite physical properties. As time goes by, changing conventions reveal more and more clearly the most powerful peculiarities of the medium until it is purified of all extraneous connections. At this point the medium has found its forms. After centuries of starts and stops, music moved toward the purity of the sonata form in the time of Mozart and Haydn. Other forms coexisted with this one, but it is apparent that music had found a natural posture in the sonata. Even into our own century composers draw on this form because listeners sense its heritage and, more importantly, because it is a pure and therefore powerful use of music.</p>
        <p>Arnheim was fearful that film, in constant search for newness, would never develop an audience capable of subtle experience. He was also worried that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> artists, moving from form to form, might pass up or give up a pure form of cinematic expression were they ever to find it.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact, Arnheim felt that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> had found such a form and had given it up. The silent <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> of the twenties was for him the high point in the history of cinema. After twenty years of experimentation, filmmakers had located the peculiarities of the medium and had established a narrative form capable of unifying the most varied effects. With the coming of sound this form was frittered away. Instead of a highly flexible set of physical sign systems, filmmakers provided audiences with a semblance of gross realism. Anyone with an eye for depth and sophistication of expression could see that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> had bartered its purity. In Arnheim’s schema, the peculiarities of the medium were being de-emphasized. Cinematic form, instead of unifying a varied set of sign systems (lighting, gesture, editing, composition), had become in the thirties a kind of laundry bag tying together imitations of reality. A streamlined, exceptionally versatile form was traded off for a form which could not help but emphasize one element, speech, turning <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> into an impure kind of theater-substitute.</p>
        <p>The sound <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> failed as art in every way. It tried to pass itself off as approaching reality, forgetting that art exists only when attention flows back on the medium. Second, it enshrined one of its parts (dialogue) at the expense not only of other de-emphasized parts, but at the expense of the organic whole. Gestalt psychologists suggest that in the evolution of any organism the loss of a constraint may produce unhealthy growth, growth which doesn’t profit the organism as a whole. A cancer results from the loss of natural checks and this cancer may destroy the whole in its expansion. The technological check against sound had kept <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> energy flowing productively into well-organized, well-balanced films, films in which all aspects worked in harmony. Sound forces every element to serve the plot and dialogue and it tries to insist on the reality of its content. To Arnheim it is indeed a cancer which has destroyed the artistic life of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> by distorting its ensemble form.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">THE PURPOSE OF FILM</h3>
        <p>What was it about late silent cinema<sup>2</sup> which so attracted Arnheim? What function was it performing so well? What, for Arnheim, is the purpose of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art? While nothing in <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as Art</em> adequately answers these questions, Arnheim’s prolific writings in the fields of art history and perceptual psychology contain many references to exactly this problem. The case with Arnheim, then, is quite similar to that with Munsterberg. Both these intellectuals composed rather slight treatises on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> (as if <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> were for them a vacation from their true fields), yet these treatises in both cases are backed up by voluminous work in related fields as well as by the prestige of an important intellectual tradition.</p>
        <p>That important tradition within which Arnheim wrote, and is still writing, is of course Gestalt psychology. Gaining prominence just after the first world war, Gestalt psychology had its greatest successes in the field of perception. The Gestaltists hold that the mind is active in the experience of reality to such an extent that it gives to reality not only its meaning but its very physical characteristics as well. Basing their beliefs on numerous experiments, the most famous of which involve shifting figure/ground relationships, they have argued that the color, shape, size, density, and brightness of objects in the world are products of the operation of the creative mind on an essentially dumb or neutral nature.</p>
        <p>Arnheim has gone so far as to assert that not merely the mind, but all our nervous centers create the world we live in by organizing it. Our eyes, our ears, the tips of our fingers give shape, color, form, and finally higher meanings to the world which stimulates them. This process is called <em class="notranslte" translate="no">transformation</em>, and it occurs constantly in all mentally healthy human beings. The Gestaltists attribute many psychological disorders to sensory misbehavior. For instance, Arnheim speaks of the schizophrenic as one who is locked into a world of a very few visual forms infinitely applied to the world. These few forms are inadequate to cope with the great quantities of stimuli which our own eyes and minds have no difficulty transforming. The schizophrenic is therefore bound to run into conflict with a reality which the rest of us, with our more “<span>healthy</span>” or, at least, more diverse structuring capabilities, force him to live within and acknowledge.</p>
        <p>The Gestaltists reserve an important place in their theories for artistic process. It is for them the very model or paradigm of perceptual activity. Well known are their experiments and diagnoses which involve the subject in an act of creating or reading (i.e., transforming) images. But beyond this the Gestaltists have lent their support to the twentieth-century trend to demythologize art, making it seem part of what we all do as human beings, rather than a divine gift which a few geniuses have the right to practice. In the Preface of his <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Art and Visual Perception</em>, Arnheim writes,</p>
        <blockquote>No longer can we consider the artistic process as a self-contained activity, mysteriously inspired from above, unrelated and unrelatable to what people do otherwise. Instead, the exalted kind of seeing that leads to the creation of great art appears as an outgrowth of the humbler and more common activity of the eyes in everyday life.<sup>3</sup></blockquote>
        <p>and later in the same book he goes on:</p>
        <blockquote>Recent [i.e., Gestalt] psychological thinking encourages us to call vision a creative activity of the human mind. Perceiving achieves, at the sensory level, what in the realm of reasoning is known as understanding. Every man’s eyesight also anticipates in a modest way the admired capacity of the artist to produce patterns that validly interpret experience by means of organized form (p. 37).</blockquote>
        <p>While art may be produced by the same human capability which allows for everyday experience, Arnheim would never suggest that it is of the same order. Art’s “<span>admirability</span>” and “<span>exaltedness</span>” come precisely from its generality, that is, from its quality of hovering above the everyday in a world of forms. Art is the organization not of a specific field of sensory data, but of a general pattern applicable beyond itself. Arnheim states that “<span>The artist uses his categories of shape and color to capture something universally significant in the particular</span>” (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Art and Visual Perception</em>, p. vi). The artist’s concern, then, is not so much his subject matter as the pattern he can create through that subject matter. When we admire a painting, we admire not the subject matter reproduced but the organization given it by the painter. In a representational painting we note that the artist has first seen his subject (this is called the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">primary transformation</em>, the transformation each of us constantly performs) and then has imaginatively organized it into a higher pattern which seems to express his particular vision of both the subject matter and all of reality (this is the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">secondary transformation)</em>. A cubist painting of a building, for example, is a transformation not of the building but of the artist’s particular mode of organizing certain kinds of perceptions.</p>
        <p>Now Arnheim has always been very careful not to overstate his case. A work of art is an expression, to be sure, and an expression which brings to light the organizing sentiments of the artist; nevertheless, we mustn’t forget that expression begins in the world. Otherwise human beings would be locked, like the schizophrenic, within a closed set of a priori categories of experience. For Arnheim art is a “<span>give and take</span>” with the world. The artist receives raw stimuli from the world which he sees as objects and events; he then projects these objects into an imaginative pattern which he thrusts back into the world. The world responds, forcing him to adapt his pattern until both artist and world are satisfied. In this way, the artwork expresses both the artist and the world.</p>
        <p>This position is more moderate than the extreme idealism or mentalism of Munsterberg. Perception and art are both founded on the organizing abilities of the mind, but for Arnheim these are supported by a world which seems to lend itself to certain kinds of organization. It seems important to point out that Gestalt psychology has struggled to base itself on physics, not on philosophy. One of its earliest and greatest members, Wolfgang KÖhler, claimed that the “<span>field</span>” concept of human perception introduced by him was directly related to the atomic physics of Max Planck.<sup>4</sup> Modern science, including ecology, has shown that certain general forms or impulses organize natural events and that every individual event takes on meaning only when seen in terms of the whole system. KÖhler took this analogy seriously and constructed theories of perception based on the physical properties of electronic and cellular movement which he assumed must occur in the nervous centers. The physical makeup of the brain, in other words, demands that we think in terms of balance, symmetry, contrast, and so on. We perceive the world according to laws which exist in us but which have been given to us by that world of which we are, therefore, integral and homogeneous parts.</p>
        <p>Whether or not other Gestalt thinkers would accept these views, Arnheim certainly sees a close rapport between the world and the mind. Certainly man’s senses and his brain pattern the world and, in art, pattern it absolutely. This would seem to give the mind authority over nature. But these patterns, Arnheim finds, have the same characteristics as raw nature. He insists on this in closing <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Art and Visual Perception:</em></p>
        <blockquote>Motifs like rising and falling, dominance and submission, weakness and strength, harmony and discord, struggle and conformance, underlie all existence. We find them within our own mind and in our relations with other people, in the human community and in the events of nature. Perception and expression fulfills its spiritual mission only if we experience in it more than the resonance of our own feelings. It permits us to realize that the forces stirring in ourselves are only individual examples of the same forces acting throughout the universe (p. 434).</blockquote>
        <p>From the broadest perspective, then, Arnheim feels that the purpose of art is to perceive and express the general forces of existence. While all human beings resolve the world of raw stimuli into a world of objects and events, the artist goes further by abstracting from those objects and events their general characteristics. Arnheim says that when he finishes a painting the artist has not thrust a self-made pattern on the world, but instead has balanced a play of forces (his own and the world’s) until his picture achieves equilibrium. Some artists, he claims, play down their own patterning in the hope of expressing the chaos of nature and of life (the romantics) ; others are compelled to stamp a timeless form on whatever nature they choose to gather to them (classical artists, the descendants of the Byzantine style). Both methods are self-destructive when carried to their limits, and all artistic styles lie somewhere between them.</p>
        <p>Arnheim does not come out in favor of one style of art over another, for he sees in the multiplicity of styles a manifestation of the endless variety in man and in nature. Nonetheless, all styles, in his view, must come to some kind of equilibrium between the mind and nature, for without this the work will be unfinished. The artist may fail at the level of the material he is supposed to pattern, satisfying himself with the mere reproduction of the particulars of nature. The result is brute sensation, sensation available to us without art, sensation never raised to the level wherein it expresses itself. On the other hand, the artist may fail at the level of his abstractions, never achieve a singular appropriate pattern for the material. This failure is called “<span>ambiguity</span>” and it “<span>confuses the artistic statement because it leaves the observer on the edge between two or more assertions which do not add up to a whole</span>” (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Art and Visual Perception</em>, p. 31). For Arnheim there is one and only one pattern which neatly matches its material bringing both of them into the light of expression. Here, more than anywhere else, he absolutely rejects the realistic theorists to be studied later. Ambiguity for them, especially for Bazin, becomes a value not a liability; nor could the artistic product from their standpoint ever be thought of as a “<span>statement</span>.”</p>
        <p>No matter how much interplay Arnheim calls for between man and nature in the creation of art, his is finally a mentalist theory of art. He looks for those moments when an equilibrium of forces, yoked by an artist’s mind from the stimuli of the world, succeeds in expressing aspects of both the artist and the world which we had never been fully aware of before. Inspiration, in the scientific and artistic spheres, is achieved when the material before one suddenly reorganizes itself into a new and satisfying structure. Both artist and scientist create the “<span>figure in the carpet,</span>” the pattern in the Rorschach patch we call reality, a pattern which reality is already predisposed to receive. Thanks to such scientific and artistic restructurings, we can see more deeply, live more fully. As a photographic medium <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> provides us with more material to pattern. As an artistic medium it can help us pattern that material and show us the ways in which our minds are joined to the physical universe we live in.</p>
        <p>Arnheim has written only a few minor articles about the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> since his book of 1932 but, as recently as 1957, he said “<span>I still believe what I believed then</span>” (<em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as Art</em>, p. 5) and his most current writings apply the selfsame ideas to still photography.<sup>5</sup> His refusal to budge from his earliest beliefs has exasperated generations of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> students, but it gives to his views a presence and solidity which cannot be ignored. Today Arnheim remains silent about the cinema, but his position has plenty of advocates from the visual literacy handbooks directly derived from him to the sophisticated theories of filmic perception which Christian Metz in France is currently developing and for which he openly indebts himself to Arnheim.<sup>6</sup></p>

        <h2 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Sergei Eisenstein</em></h2>
        <p>The views of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> developed by Sergei Eisenstein are infinitely richer and more complex than those of either Arnheim or Munsterberg. Unlike them, Eisenstein was a filmmaker of immeasurable ability whose fame assured his writings on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> an immediate and broad readership. Eisenstein was an energetic and eclectic thinker. Unlike Arnheim and Munsterberg, however, he was temperamentally unable to deduce a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory from a firmly held philosophy, and he cluttered up his theoretical research with massive amounts of arcane data culled from a lifetime of scattered reading in at least four languages.</p>
        <p>While he paid public homage to Marx and Lenin and was certainly committed to many of their theories, Eisenstein was not the kind of thinker who embraces a single idea or tradition which he then systematically develops. Eisenstein was interested in countless subjects and numerous theories about those subjects. He would browse creatively in a bookstore or library, ferreting out facts and hypotheses of all sorts which later he would apply to his own special passion, film.</p>
        <p>All this gives many of his ideas the look of pop-theory. Just examine his essay “<span>Color and Meaning</span>” (in <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> Sense)</em>, where he puts together a vast but diffuse list of famous statements on color theory. The list is impressive and altogether fascinating. It will remain an important resource in the theory of color aesthetics, but it is a collection of statements harboring myriad confusions and contradictions which Eisenstein, in his passionate pursuit of the subject, didn’t bother to untangle. In his excitement to confirm his intuitive feelings about color and cinema, he hurriedly brought to bear all the sources he could, many hardly relevant to his theory. And this is characteristic. His writing always manifested the drama of discovery which he actually experienced in working out his theory. He would, it seems, suddenly be struck by an intuition and be driven to ransack history, economics, art history, psychology, anthropology, and countless other fields in order to substantiate that intuition. Or at other times it appears that a new idea concerning some aspect of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory was delivered to him through a nearly random encounter with books, events, people. His seminal essay “<span>The Unexpected</span>” (in <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> Form</em>) begins, “<span>We have been visited by the Kabuki theater …</span>” and goes on to develop a theory of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> image which struck him while he viewed that theater.</p>
        <p>While all of us operate in this way to some extent (from intuition to a search for support for that intuition) few writers expose this process as ingenuously as did Eisenstein. The quality of shock which he so stressed in filmmaking is an integral part of his tactics in writing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory as well. Skim the essay “<span>A Dialectical Approach to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> Form</span>” (in <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> Form</em>) and you will see graphically how Eisenstein tried to burst ideas upon us rather than weave them into a fabric of linear logic. Even between any two of his essays there is the continual use of abrupt transition rather than any dissolving or match-cutting of ideas. Just as he claimed one must listen for overtones between shots in films, so we must listen for such overtones between his essays.</p>
        <p>All this makes reading Eisenstein an interesting but tenuous business; and it makes summarizing him nearly impossible. In what follows I hope merely to try to locate Eisenstein within the categories of questions which we have used in examining other theorists. Optimally such an orientation will give the reader some compass points and several monuments he can rely on as he wanders through the various quarters, avenues, and back alleys which make up this rich theoretic megolopolis which we call the work of Eisenstein.</p>
        <p>It is only fair to note at the outset that our concern throughout this chapter will be to try to maintain the same sense of struggle which Eisenstein’s ideas seemingly went through on every level. While each statement he made may sound dogmatic and final, they must all be seen to qualify one another. This is the true dialectical mode of thinking, a mode of which Eisenstein was a brilliant practitioner.</p>
        <p>We will see first that his conception of the basic material of the medium grew from the belief that the single shot was the film’s basic building block (a belief Vsevolod Pudovkin never transcended) to a much more complex conception, that of the “<span>attraction</span>.” This latter concept is much less mechanistic than the shot, for it takes into account the activity of the viewer’s mind, not simply the action of the filmmaker’s will. Nevertheless, Eisenstein never fully abandoned the determinism of his early views and the hope that the filmmaker, through a calculated structuring of attractions, could shape the mental processes of the spectator.</p>
        <p>Next, at the level of creative process we will see how his attitude toward <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, generally thought to be unflinching and dogmatic, actually veered from its starting point in a rather dramatic way. The struggle between Eisenstein’s fluctuating view of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is best seen in the changing relation that concept has to certain types of psychology. While Eisenstein seems to have conceived of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> within the psychological model of Pavlov, or at least of the associationists, his later writings on the issue seem much closer to the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget. Once again his initially simple mechanistic notions were questioned and altered by a more complex and less predictable variant, one which brought a respect for the powers of the spectator and for the mysterious workings of perception and understanding.</p>
        <p>The tension between the simple, predictable, mechanistic process of filmmaking and the complex developmental experience of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> viewing emerged explicitly in Eisenstein’s double view, first of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form and then of the purpose of film. He thought of the unified <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> sometimes as a machine and sometimes as an organism. He spoke of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> sometimes as if it were a powerful vehicle for rhetorical persuasion and sometimes as if it were a higher, almost mystical means of knowing the universe, that is, he spoke of it as autonomous art. These two pairs of dialectical opposites (the machine versus the organism and rhetoric versus art) will be looked at separately. In my view it was the very frustration of trying to hold opposed views that allowed Eisenstein to question every view and to remain a productive theorist for over thirty years. His essays are always scintillating because each is infused with an energy derived from the juxtaposition of opposite tendencies. He felt these oppositions in himself, in the world he lived in, and in that subject he spent his life trying to understand, the cinema.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">THE RAW MATERIAL OF FILM</h3>
        <p>Eisenstein studied mechanical engineering in the years before he entered the artistic colony of Moscow, and when he joined that colony he entered a period known as “<span>Constructivism</span>.” From the beginning Eisenstein considered the artistic activity to be one of “<span>making</span>” or, more precisely, of “<span>building</span>.” For this reason the question of the “<span>raw material</span>” which the artist has at his disposal was constantly paramount in his mind.</p>
        <p>What bothered Eisenstein about the films which he saw was their inefficiency. The filmmaker, he felt, was at the mercy of the events which he filmed, even if he staged those events. The audience watched screen events exactly as they watched everyday happenings, making the filmmaker a mere channel through which reality could be reproduced. Eisenstein had faced a similar problem in the theater in the early 1920s when he was involved in the brutal fight between the Moscow Art Theater and the avant-garde theater movements of which he was a part. “<span>The Moscow Art Theater is my deadly enemy,</span>” he said, because its concern was with a faithful replication of reality. The Constructivists countered this realism in a series of ways, most of which involved the breaking up of the various aspects of theater into bits which could be recomposed according to the formal wishes of the director. The sets should not provide a backdrop for the dialogue, the Constructivists argued, but should function on equal terms alongside the dialogue, almost in dialogue with the dialogue. The same holds true for lighting, blocking, costuming, and so on, all of which should coexist in a democratic harmony rather than in a feudal hierarchy. Even in the theater, then, Eisenstein was seeking ways in which he could break reality down into useful material for the director to fashion.</p>
        <p>The process of thus decomposing reality into usable blocks or units may be termed <em class="notranslte" translate="no">neutralization</em>. He claimed that music and painting are based on the neutralization of sound and tone, respectively. In his essay on color he specifically denied that a given color might have a meaning of its own, that yellow, for instance, might signify jealousy and red, passion. Color meaning, like all meaning for Eisenstein, derives from an interrelation of neutral particles: green takes on a particular meaning when it appears in a relational system involving other colors and other codes.</p>
        <p>Eisenstein recognized that the elementary <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> particle, the individual shot, is different from a tone or a sound. It is already comprehensible and appeals immediately to the mind of the spectator as well as to his senses. In order to give the filmmaker the same power which the composer and painter has, Eisenstein felt, shots must be neutralized so that they might become basic formal elements which could be combined however the director saw fit and according to whatever formal principles he might want. Their native “<span>sense</span>” must be extracted so that their physical properties might be used to create a new and higher signification.</p>
        <p>The “<span>unexpected</span>” revelation which the kabuki theater brought about in Eisenstein at last gave him the evidence he needed for his theories of neutralization. Kabuki employs an exaggerated stylization far beyond what we normally allow in Western theater. It doesn’t simply heighten the reality of fact or event; nor does it merely give a particular slant or interpretation to facts and events through stylization, as Arnheim thought all art should do; instead it deforms and alters all events and facts until they retain only a physical basis. All aspects of the drama become equal, since all have been stylized into sheer epidermis, sheer physical form. In this way the kabuki rendering of, say, a murder, is quite different from conventional Western <em class="notranslte" translate="no">mise en scène</em>. The stylization of the murder gesture eliminates its primacy and puts it on an equal footing with the other gestures it co-operates with. Moreover, all these stylized gestures function in a larger system containing stylized codes of sounds, costuming, and decor in such a way that one cannot say that these other codes are there to support the gestures. The meaning of a kabuki play, in other words, could never be understood by a recounting of the plot or gestures. It is the form of the ensemble which contains the meaning and this form, in Eisenstein’s view, is as abstract and as powerful as a musical or painterly form. Reality no longer holds down the theater. Gesture has become the equal of tone or color.</p>
        <p>Following his experience with kabuki theater, Eisenstein hoped to create for <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> a system in which all the elements would be equal and commensurable: lighting, composition, acting, story, even subtitles must be interrelated, so that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> can escape the crude realism of mere storytelling accompanied by supporting elements. Eisenstein claimed that each element functions like a circus attraction, different from the other attractions at the fair but on an equal footing and capable of giving the spectator a precise psychological impression. This is quite different from conventional aesthetics, which sees lighting, blocking, camera work, and so on as supporting the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">dominant</em> action, creating a large impression. For Eisenstein, viewing a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is like being jolted by a continuous string of shocks coming from each of the various elements of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> spectacle, not just from the story.</p>
        <p>In his earliest writing Eisenstein believed that the smallest unit of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> was the shot and that each shot acted like a circus attraction to deliver a particular psychological stimulus which could then combine with other neighboring shots to build the film. Later Eisenstein became more interested in the possibilities of elements within the shot itself providing several sympathetic or conflicting attractions. In any case Eisenstein felt that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> could exist as an art only when it reduced itself to “<span>bundles</span>” of attractions, like musical notes, which could be shaped rhythmically and thematically into the rich textures of full experiences.</p>
        <p>In music, all possible pitches in the universe are regulated until they form a keyboard capable of harmonic interplay. Eisenstein wanted a keyboard for <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> so that the director could utilize every element either alone or in combination with other elements and be sure of the result. Following Pavlov he believed that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> shots, or attractions, could be controlled for specific audience effect.</p>
        <p>(fugure)</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Potemkin, 1925. The Museum of Modem Art/<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Stills Archive</em></h3>
        <p>In sum, Eisenstein never considered the mere recording of life as cinematic. Early in his career he chided filmmakers who used extended takes. What could be gained by continuing to gaze at an event once its significance had made its imprint? For him the raw material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> resided in the elements within the shot capable of provoking a discrete (and potentially measurable) reaction within the spectator.</p>
        <p>The main values of such neutralization of elements are transference and synaesthesia. In transference a single effect can be produced by a number of different elements. In a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> many elements are present on the screen at once. They may reinforce each other, heightening the effect (this occurs in the conventional <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> Eisenstein deplores); the elements may conflict among themselves and create a new effect; or an unexpected element may convey a needed effect. This last is the height of transference. In <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Potemkin</em> (1925), for instance, when the bourgeois lady says on the Odessa Steps, “<span>Let us appeal to them,</span>” she is answered not by a speech or a subtitle, nor even by an action, but by the elongated shadows of the soldiers which move silently, incessantly, and ominously down the steps. Here, where elements of speech and lighting are in dialogue, a transference of effect has occurred.</p>
        <p>When several elements combine at the same time, there is the possible of synaesthesia, or multisensory experience. A good example of this is found in Jean Vigo’s wonderful <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> <em class="notranslte" translate="no">L’Atalante</em> (1934). After her wedding night, the bride, Dita Parlo, emerges from the hold of the ship, and the following things occur simultaneously: the camera position shifts instantly from long shot to close up; the sun shines with a blinding light on the face of Dita Parlo which breaks into an irresistible smile; and the crew gives her an accordion serenade. Here four kinds of elements combine to produce a synaesthetic experience in the viewer. We see, hear, feel, and nearly smell the freshness of that moment. This is possible, Eisnstein feels, because the filmmaker has the ability to build each of these attractions any way he chooses. He at last has a workable material.</p>
        <p>(figure)</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">L’Atalante</em>, 1934.</h3>
        <p>In making the filmmaker the equal of the painter, composer, and sculptor, Eisenstein goes much further than Pudovkin with whom he has often been associated. Pudovkin put the filmmaker at the mercy of the shot and insisted that creative filmmaking comes from the proper choice and organization of these bits of reality which already have a definite power. He suggested that the filmmaker see through the confusion of history and psychology and create a smooth train of images which would lead toward an overall narrative event. For Pudovkin the sense of the world already exists in the reality captured by the shots, but it could be heightened and released by fastidious editing. The filmmaker has the means, Pudovkin believed, to force the spectator to experience a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> event as if it were a natural event. He can slyly direct and control the attention and emotions of the spectator as he leads him not through the confusion of history but through the clarity of a reality reorganized on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> so that its hidden relationships have been brought out. Pudovkin’s stress on the individual shot as the basic fragment of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> lines him up much closer than Eisenstein to the realist <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorists. Even at his most formative, when he talked of creating events on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> by means of editing, Pudovkin stopped far short of Eisenstein. Pudovkin wanted to link shots to lead the spectator surreptitiously to the acceptance of an event, a story, or a theme. Eisenstein noted this and demanded not <em class="notranslte" translate="no">linkage</em> but <em class="notranslte" translate="no">collision</em>, not a passive audience, but an audience of co-creators.</p>
        <p>All these differences between the two great contemporaries stem from the crucial concept of raw material. Eisenstein could never accept the notion of the shot as a bit of reality which the filmmaker gathers. He insisted as willfully as he could that the shot was a locus of formal elements such as lighting, line, movement, and volume. The natural sense of the shot need not, should not, dominate our experience. If the filmmaker is truly creative he will construct his own sense out of this raw material; he will build relations which aren’t implicit in the “<span>meaning</span>” of the shot. He will create rather than direct meaning.</p>
        <p>Most films and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theories today still bear the mark of Pudovkin far more than that of Eisenstein, but it is Eisenstein who has ignited the imagination of those seeking a new cinema. His theory of raw material is infinitely more complex than Pudovkin’s, for it contains within it a material side (the aspects of the shot he calls attractions) and a mental, or even spiritual, side (the mind which is attracted). Pudovkin simplified this problem by defining raw material from the position of the filmmaker. A shot is a mere technical step in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> production. A shock or an attraction, on the other hand, is a relation between mind and matter; it is a question of audience experience and is thereby a much subtler, much richer concept.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">CINEMATIC MEANS: CREATION THROUGH MONTAGE</h3>
        <p>While the raw material for <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is the discrete stimuli within the shots, we must not leap to the conclusion that for Eisenstein such stimuli are equivalent to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself. They are rather like building blocks or, to use his analogy, “<span>cells</span>.” <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is created only when these independent cells receive an animating principle. What gives life to these stimuli, making a full <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> experience possible? For this we must move to the famous and central concept of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">montage</em>.</p>
        <p>Just as Eisenstein’s insight into the material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> had been generated by kabuki theater, so it was his study of haiku poetry which ostensibly led him to an understanding of montage. In the very “<span>alphabet</span>” of the Japanese language Eisenstein saw the basis for <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> dynamics. What is an ideogram, he asks, if not the collision of two ideas, or attractions? The picture of a bird and a mouth means “<span>to sing,</span>” while the picture of a child and a mouth means “<span>to scream</span>.” Here a change in one attraction (from bird to child) produces not a variant of the same concept but an utterly new signification. In <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> the senses perceive attractions, but cinematic meaning is generated only when the mind leaps to their comprehension by attending to the collision of these attractions.</p>
        <p>Haiku poetry, made up of ideograms, works in a similar manner. It records a short series of sense perceptions, forcing the mind to create their unified sense, and producing a precise psychological impact. Eisenstein gives the following from among several examples:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>A lonely crow</p>
              <p>on leafless bough</p>
                     <p>one autumn eve.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Each phrase of this poem can be seen as an attraction, and the combination of phrases is montage. The collision of attractions from line to line produces the unified psychological effect which is the hallmark of haiku and of montage.</p>
        <p>After pointing to the case of haiku, Eisenstein immediately lists the kinds of conflict between attractions available to the filmmaker: conflict of graphic direction, of scales, of volumes, of masses, of depths, of darkness and lightness, of focal lengths, and so on. In a later essay he enumerates the general kinds of effects such collision can yield. He discovers five “<span>methods of montage</span>” from the absolutely mathematical metric <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, where conflict is created strictly in the lengths or duration of shots, to intellectual <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, where meaning is the result of a conscious leap made by the spectator between two terms of a visual metaphor or figure. Most of Eisenstein’s writing deals with the methods lying between these two extremes. He says conflict can be organized rhythmically, tonally, and overtonally. Each of these methods depends on a conflict between the graphic elements of the shots. Our senses apprehend the attraction of each shot and our inner minds join these attractions through similarity or contrast, creating a higher unity and a significance. Shots as attractions, then, are mere stimulation. It is the specific interaction of shots (at the level of length, rhythm, tone, overtone, or metaphor) which produces meaning. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is for Eisenstein the creative power of film, the means by which the individual “<span>cells</span>” become a living cinematic whole; <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is the life principle which gives meaning to raw shots.</p>
        <p>While Eisenstein worked out these central concepts concerning <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> quite early in his career, he continued to give attention to problems related to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> all during his life. Specifically, he tried to illustrate how various particular elements could be creatively amalgamated into the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> experience. As film’s technology expanded, Eisenstein hurriedly indicated the formative potential of each new device. In this he was much more liberal (and, I might say, more palatable to modern readers) than Arnheim, with whom he had some obvious similarities on other matters.</p>
        <p>The famous “<span>Statement on Sound,</span>” which Eisenstein wrote in conjunction with Pudovkin and Grigori Alexandrov, is a perfect example of the adaptability of his theory of montage. While Eisenstein’s ideas about film’s raw material and about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> construction had been pronounced before sound had become a viable addition to film, he quickly incorporated this “<span>realistic</span>” invention into his anti-realistic theory.</p>
        <blockquote>There will be commercial exploitation of the most saleable merchandise, TALKING FILMS. Those in which sound-recording will proceed on a naturalistic level, exactly corresponding with the movement on the screen, and providing a certain “<span>illusion</span>.” …</blockquote>
        <blockquote>To use sound in this way may well destroy the culture of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, for every ADHESION of sound to a visual piece increases its inertia as a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> piece and increases the independence of its meaning—and this will undoubtedly be to the detriment of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, operating in the first place not on the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> pieces but on their juxtaposition.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Only a CONTRAPUNTAL USE of sound in relation to the visual <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> piece will afford a new potentiality of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> development and perfection.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Eisenstein immediately goes on to suggest that experiments with non-synchronous sound “<span>will lead to the creation of an orchestral counterpoint of visual images and aural images</span>.” He sees in the sound track a way of integrating dialogue and information, not to mention music, in a manner far superior to the use of subtitles.</blockquote>
        <p>The case of sound is just one of many instances in which Eisenstein proclaimed a “<span>montage</span>” use of realistic technology. In another instance he supported color cinematography because color could form an additional complex code of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> units, or attractions, which could interact with other elements in the film. As a viewing of his <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Ivan the Terrible</em>, Part II, will demonstrate, he must have thought long and hard about the possibilities of such unrealistic use of color. In that film, color was employed alongside black and white footage, and the colors themselves were carefully segregated through filters and costuming to shock the spectator with a new visual element. Similarly he was eager that 3-D be developed, for he saw in it new parameters of relations between volume and space, giving the filmmaker an additional element to control. Finally, he wrote a plea for the use of the perfectly square screen shape, rejecting the encroachments of wider and wider ratios. Since he considered the screen to be a frame rather than a window, he felt that the “<span>dynamic square</span>” offered more varied possibilities for screen shapes.</p>
        <p>Always, then, Eisenstein sought to increase the number of variables at the filmmaker’s command; but at the same time he was eager that all elements remain at that command and not operate on their own. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is the veritable voice of command which builds these elements into a film. Whereas Hollywood welcomed technical developments because of the added realism which they provided for the spectator, Eisenstein sought to subvert the natural realism of sound, color, and 3-D through the breaking up or “<span>neutralization</span>” of these elements, allowing them to function in contrapuntal juxtaposition with the other elements of the film. They provided, as it were, a new range of sounds on the keyboard which could be integrated into the artistic experience by the composer-filmmaker through the energy of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> construction.</p>
        <p>Eisenstein’s concept of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> has many sources. It was a key notion in Constructivist aesthetics, though never developed so fully as in Eisenstein’s <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory. It clearly owes a good deal to the theories of dialectical thinking held by Hegel, Marx, and nearly everyone else in Eisenstein’s socio-cultural milieu. It also shares much with many psychological theories of the 1920s, theories Eisenstein surely was acquainted with, given his deep interest in thought processes.</p>
        <p>It is fascinating to place <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> theory next to some theories of cognition prevalent during the twenties if only because it helps separate Eisenstein from Arnheim, whose Gestalt psychology he could never have accepted. Certainly Eisenstein’s interest in Pavlov was enough to estrange him from Arnheim, for Pavlov worked at the level of the significance of individual stimuli, whereas Gestalt psychology emphasizes the “<span>field</span>” or “<span>whole,</span>” which absorbs and transforms stimuli and from which stimuli derive whatever significance they have. Eisenstein’s concept of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, however, went far beyond Pavlov. What is often neglected is the probable influence upon Eisenstein of the Associationists, who flourished in the twenties. They stressed the laws of space, time, and causality which relate individual percepts. Like Eisenstein, they broke the cognitive process down into sequences of individual imagistic elements, related not by syntax as is language but by sheer juxtaposition. The noted psychologist E. B. Titchener even suggested that it takes at least two sensations to make a meaning. This provides a clear rationale for Eisenstein’s theory of montage.</p>
        <p>But it is the famous child psychologist Jean Piaget who provided the most striking psychological parallel to Eisenstein’s theory. Eisenstein knew the ideas of the great Swiss thinker through the work of Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist of the period very close to Piaget. No matter how close the actual relation was between Eisenstein and the school of Piaget, the many ideas common to these two men are worth noting:<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>1. <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Ego-centrism</em>. In Piaget’s scheme children aged 2–7 engage in pre-operational thought in which their representations cannot be differentiated from themselves. In many ways Eisenstein looked at the viewing experience as an egocentric activity. The viewer adopts the images on the screen as if they embodied his own pre-cognitive experience.</p>
        <p>2. <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Primary felt symbol</em>. In the 2–7-year-old stage Piaget found the predominance of the felt symbol as an organizing operation. Such symbols are highly iconic in nature; that is, the symbol emulates as closely as possible the physical characteristics of that for which it stands. As an example of this, Piaget cited a child opening her mouth to facilitate learning how to open a box. This example is peculiarly apt in considering Eisenstein’s theories, since Eisenstein once spoke of his admiration for a Philippine tribe which would give any member in childbirth spiritual support by opening all the doors of the village (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">cf. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Form</em>, p. 135).</p>
        <p>3. <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> thinking</em>. Piaget discovered that young children measure meaning by examining the difference between the two terminal states of a process without paying any attention whatsoever to the intermediate stages linking them. His experiments in this area are well known: a child watches water poured from one container into a taller, thinner container and concludes that there is now more water. The pouring itself was not taken into account. In many respects Eisenstein’s <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> theories assume just this kind of attention to terminal states. This is one reason that he came out so strongly against the long-take, a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> style which necessarily focuses on the unfolding of an event. He preferred to shoot static fragments of an event, energizing them with a dynamic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> principle. For a child in Piaget’s scheme and for an audience in Eisenstein’s theory, it is more meaningful to show three lions in quick succession, each static, each occupying a different position, but together suggesting fierce arousement, than to show one lion actually rousing itself to fight.</p>
        <p>4. <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Inner speech</em>. In his essay “<span><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Form—New Problems,</span>” Eisenstein talked explicitly about the ability of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to render the syntax of inner speech, a syntax of image clashes and overlaps which only later was translated and tamed into the logic of uttered speech. Piaget suggested, as might be expected, that children operate in a world of inner speech made up of a collage of images. They slowly learn to modify their personal worlds when this inner speech is repeatedly confronted with an external situation to which it does not conform. Usually inner speech is largely replaced by operative public syntax by age seven. It is characterized by several aspects which relate to Eisenstein’s <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory. First, it occurs in “<span>unconscious movement</span>” from image sequence to image sequence. Second, it is “<span>transductive</span>” in that the child attributes causation to the visually associated elements in juxtaposition. Finally, it exhibits a basic “<span>syncretism</span>” which clusters numerous elements into a single event.</p>
        <p>Eisenstein employed none of Piaget’s vocabulary, but we can say that he wanted the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to resurrect inner speech. He wanted the flow of inner speech to be activated by <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> and to build toward an emotionally significant event through visual juxtaposition. In Piaget’s terms, he wanted <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to become or to produce a “<span>global syncretism of individual transductive inferences</span>.”</p>
        <p>Eisenstein’s fascination with primitive societies and with the expressions of children reinforce the conception of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> art as a return to a pre-logical Eden. He certainly would not be the first aesthetician to see in art a recovery of a supra-logical thinking capacity which unselfconsciously provides an immediate experience or renders an immediate communication.</p>
        <p><span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is the instrument of this heightened consciousness. In language it by-passes public syntax and creates the strongest of poetic effects. In <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> it takes inarticulate or banal elements and fuses them into ideas too rich for words. At its best, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> shapes these felt ideas into a grand syncretic emotional event, an event capable of reorienting our thought and our action. By itself <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> can’t perform this feat; we must go outside <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> to discover the most powerful and effective shapes and structures <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> can adopt. Yet <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> remains the crucial life principle which energizes every worthwhile <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and which provides an entrée to the pre-logical world of imagistic thinking where art has its deepest consequences.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> FORM</h3>
        <p>In the 1920s Eisenstein realized that individual attractions could never account for signification in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and so he introduced the unifying and dynamic concept of montage. Toward the end of that decade and all through the 1930s Eisenstein struggled to go beyond simple <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> to the level of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form, for it became clear to him that despite the life-giving energy of shot juxtaposition, mere juxtaposition could never of itself determine the impact of a whole film. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> accounts for signification at the local level but not for the overall significance.</p>
        <p>The question of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form actually arose within his consideration of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> itself as a question about what he called <em class="notranslte" translate="no">the dominant</em>. In any given shot there are multiple attractions; which of these should determine the kind of juxtaposition required? If shot A is joined to shot B on the basis of conflicting light values, can the filmmaker then join to them shot C, which interacts with B in regard to screen direction? If so, what happens to the light value of shot C? Do we as spectators simply ignore it? Such questions led Eisenstein to suggest that every shot has a dominant attraction and many subsidiary ones in the context of the unrolling film. In narrative films the story line dictates what should attract us first about a shot. In a police film, for example, we will instantly spot the killer as he hides behind lace curtains. The other attractions of the shot (the motion of the curtains in the breeze; the mottled moonlight and shadows on the room; and so on) play around the central attraction of the figure. In a slightly more abstract <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> the dominant attraction might be the moonlight and its shadows and the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> would follow the progress of changing light values. In such a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> the figure behind lace curtains would no longer usurp our attention. Many experimental films in the twenties and thirties attempted organization along lines other than plot.</p>
        <p>The notion of the dominant was prevalent in Russia during the twenties and no doubt Eisenstein was familiar with the crucial essay entitled simply “<span>The Dominant,</span>” written in 1927 by the noted literary critic, Roman Jakobson. A literary work is made up of a host of interacting codes, Jakobson asserts, but one code becomes the dominant and controls the inflections of the other codes.<sup>3</sup> In certain lyrical poems, for example, sound codes of alliteration and assonance dominate the system and draw to themselves the other codes of narrative, repetition, images, and so on.</p>
        <p>This concept seems in conflict with the notion of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">neutralization</em>, wherein all codes become effectively equal. Eisenstein vacillated between these ideas, considering all systems to have a dominant, on the one hand, while, on the other, encouraging artists to break away from its tyranny. In the most obvious case, we can say that every <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> pursues several lines, the most apparent of which is the narrative or story line. In most films it is the story line which dominates the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> bringing all other aspects “<span>into line</span>” with it. Clearly Eisenstein was eager to subvert this convention of giving more independence and importance to those other, “<span>subsidiary</span>” codes.</p>
        <p>In treating subsidiary codes, Eisenstein returned to his musical analogy, suggesting that every shot is made up of a series of tones and overtones aside from its dominant. The dominant is that which most fully strikes the viewer’s attention, while tones and overtones are “<span>secondary stimuli</span>” playing at the periphery of both the image and the viewer’s consciousness. Eisenstein admitted that all his early consideration of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> was concentrated on juxtapositions of the dominants within a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> <span class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</span>. Later he began to emphasize <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> which would bring out other lines of development within a film.</p>
        <p>It becomes clear that Eisenstein began to think of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> experience as a nexus of complementary lines, rather than as a staccato system of discrete stimuli. If we consider shots to be like the discrete notes of a piano piece being shaped by a composer into several lines, we must recall that the dominant line in traditional music would no doubt be the melody line, but any good piece must be rich in tones and overtones created by attention to the peripheral harmonics of the keyboard in relation to the developing piece.</p>
        <p>In his essay “<span>The Filmic Fourth Dimension</span>” (in <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Form)</em>, Eisenstein meditated specifically on this musical analogy. While he admitted that a dominant does exist, he came out for a neutralization of elements (which he called a “<span>democratic equality of rights for all provocations, or stimuli, regarding them as a… complex,</span>” <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Form</em>, p. 68). He then suggested that filmmakers begin working with the overtones as much as with the dominant in order to create the equivalent of the “<span>impressionism</span>” of Debussy or Scriabin. In passing, we might note that of all composers, they are the two most frequently associated with synesthesia, Scriabin even composing musical evocations of colors.</p>
        <p>Stimulated by his sense of musical form, Eisenstein began making references to “<span>total experience,</span>” and “<span>the feeling of the whole</span>.” The filmmaker must not merely mechanically join <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> pieces along a dominant line, but must sensitively orchestrate a vibrating whole so that the viewer can receive a host of organized stimuli weaving variously throughout his mind but creating a final impression, a feeling of totality. Such interconnected <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> thinking is “<span>polyphonic montage</span>” and its result is “<span>unity through synthesis</span>.” These notions are of a higher level than <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> just as <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> was of a higher level than the attractions it juxtaposed. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is the energy of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> which makes the raw material come alive, but the concept of synthetic unity is what directs this energy toward an overall goal, toward a meaningful shape.</p>
        <p>Virtually all of Eisenstein’s ruminations concerning <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form and unity can be reduced to an interplay between the images of “<span>art machine</span>” and “<span>art organism</span>.” Again and again he insisted that art must be the intersection of nature and industry. In one of his earliest essays he was already trying to yoke these traditionally antithetical concepts:</p>
        <blockquote><span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> thinking—the height of differentially sensing and resolving the “<span>organic</span>” world—is realized anew in a mathematic faultlessly performing instrument machine (<em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Form</em>, p. 27).</blockquote>
        <p>Eisenstein’s characteristically clarion style proclaims the successful confrontation of an organic world with an art machine. But this youthful optimism gave way to many doubts and continual reexamination of these images. We can say that as he grew older his conception of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form shifted markedly from an interest in mechanical shape (born during the Constructivist period) to organic form, but at no time did the conflict between the two ever disappear entirely.</p>
        <p>In order to grasp, even in outline form, Eisenstein’s complicated views concerning <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form, let us look at these two images separately and in some depth.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Art Machine</em></h3>
        <p>The image of art as a machine comes first, no doubt, from the many classical rhetoricians who spoke of art as a device for controlling the responses of an audience. In more recent times the nineteenth-century realists, especially Taine and Zola, contributed to the elaboration of this image. But most of Eisenstein’s debts for his image of art as machine are unquestionably owed to the Constructivists with whom he worked. They took seriously the dictum of Marx and Lenin that art, first of all, is work like any other work. One need only glance over the paintings and prints of this era or read the descriptions of theatrical sets (many of which Eisenstein worked on) to see how religiously this idea was held. Eisenstein was also a partisan of a new theory of acting called <em class="notranslte" translate="no">bio-mechanics</em>. In the twenties it successfully challenged the Stanislavski method, the heart of the abhorred and utterly naturalistic Moscow Art Theater. The very name bio-mechanics demonstrates the orientation of the avant-garde in Russia in the twenties.</p>
        <p>What are the properties of a machine which make it a viable analogue for an artwork? It is, first of all, an intentional construction designed with specific goals in mind. It is invented to accomplish a purpose or to solve a problem which exists prior to its invention. It is fully designed before it is constructed and at all stages it is rectified until its engineering conforms to its purpose. Both the construction and the functioning of the machine are largely predictable. Wherever possible the engineers employ familiar parts and familiar methods in order that the finished machine correspond closely to the design. The machine itself is then altered and modified until it cleanly and efficiently performs its operation. If it is a good machine its performance will be predictable. If the machine begins to fail, it can be fixed by replacing the troublesome parts. As time goes by it may lose its effectiveness and be superseded by a newer model designed to perform the same function but in an even more efficient fashion, responding to advances in science and technology.</p>
        <p>Now many of these aspects of a machine appealed to Eisenstein’s sense of the nature and purpose of film. We have seen that for him the raw material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is the “<span>attraction</span>” and that a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is a series of shocks set off in the spectator, a kind of psychological machine. From this it follows that the form of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> depends on the kind of experience the filmmaker wishes to evoke. The creative process in fact begins with the artist making himself fully aware of the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">end</em> he has in mind, then deciding on the best possible <em class="notranslte" translate="no">means</em> of attaining that end.</p>
        <p>The means involves a series of steps, each of which operates at a successively higher level of abstraction within the spectator. First comes the raw material, the bare attractions which may be defined as anything in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> which makes a difference to the spectator. Through simple juxtapositions of these primary stimuli, basic cinematic meanings are created. These innumerable moments of montage-meaning begin to coalesce into lines of development, including a dominant line and several attendant lines. The most common such lines are characterization, plot, overall lighting tone, and so on. The spectator takes these clusters of dramatic meaning and actually re-creates the story of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> by resolving the tensions with which he is confronted.</p>
        <p>Conflict in character, plot, tone, and all higher levels of meaning is exactly analogous to the physical conflict Eisenstein felt was at the basis of primary montage. The repeated and nearly countless conflicts between attractions produce the grand conflicts and tensions of the drama. Here, of course, the conflicting elements are quite easily identified: a certain set of characters set off against another set; a past action set against the present; wintery decor and lighting played against a springlike atmosphere, and so on.</p>
        <p>This dramatic level begins to dissolve into an even higher level of generality within the spectator’s mind. He sees the story as merely a single instance of a general theme which could be stated by other stories and other oppositions. At the highest level, then, the spectator becomes aware of the central problem or problems which the filmmaker had hoped to engender within him. The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> has functioned as a machine, utilizing reliable fuel (attractions), energized to create a steady stream of motion (montage), developing a controlled and total dramatic meaning (story, tone, character, etc.), leading toward an inevitable destination (the final idea or theme).</p>
        <p>Since Eisenstein believed that the mind works dialectically by making syntheses between opposing elements and that the crowning moment of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> comes when the mind synthesizes the opposing ideas which give a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> its energy, he wanted to allow the spectator to be aware of synthesizing the entire film, from the smallest particles to the controlling ideas. Whereas D. W. Griffith and Pudovkin had hoped to lead the spectator forward in a trance toward a conclusion which would suddenly burst upon him from nowhere, Eisenstein always insisted that the spectator aid in forging the meaning of the film. In this, of course, his theory resembles the theories of drama which Bertolt Brecht was building at the time.</p>
        <p>In his <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Strike</em>, for instance, Eisenstein didn’t hesitate to juxtapose bizarre images, like the face of a man and the picture of a fox, or the picture of a crowd and one of a bull being slaughtered. These images, each providing a strong stimulus, remain meaningless until the mind creates the links between them through its metaphoric capability. The story itself emerges from numerous such metaphors, the mind creating an interplay between specific workers struggling against a specific managerial system. Before the end of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> the spectator begins synthesizing the controlling ideas of the film, ideas about capital vs. labor. The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> achieves its effect when the spectator realizes the conclusion (or synthesis) of the collision of such major ideas. The synthesis in this case is one which demands the overthrow of capitalism and the ascendancy of the working class.</p>
        <p>The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> machine exists to deliver the theme to the spectator. All the filmmaker’s attention is focused on the means needed to lead that spectator to a confrontation with the theme. And the filmmaker must lead him there with his eyes open, exposing to the spectator his means, his mechanism, not merely because this style is preferable to the illusionary realism which is the hallmark of Hollywood but because the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> derives its energy from the conscious mental leaps of the spectator. The audience literally brings to life the dead stimuli, forcing lightning to leap from pole to pole until a whole story is aglow and until the theme is illuminated beyond both doubt and ignorance. Without the audience’s active participation there would be no artwork. This mechanistic theory of art must always focus on the structure and habits of the human mind more than on the subject of the artwork, for the human mind is the means by which the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> exists and the destination of its message. The organic theory, on the contrary, stresses the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> object itself as self-sufficient, self-sustaining.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Organic Analogy</em></h3>
        <p>Eisenstein never gave himself totally to the mechanistic theory outlined above. From the first there was the hint in his writing of a conflicting theory, the organic. This hint developed into the dominant theme of his writing in the thirties. The lengthy and crucial essay, variously entitled “<span>Word and Image</span>” (in <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Sense</em>) and “<span><span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> 1938</span>” (in <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Notes of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Director)</em>, is essentially a meditation on the problems organic theory poses for his earlier ideas on film. The actual sources of Eisenstein’s ideas about organic theory are too numerous to recount here. Organic theory has been the most influential model of artistic creation in Western civilization since the beginning of the nineteenth century. Eisenstein’s desire to fuse some ideas from this tradition with the more radical Constructivism of his youth is natural.</p>
        <p>What aspects does an organism have which makes it comparable to a work of art? Most centrally there is the life principle or soul which lives within every part of the organism, causing it to develop into its proper shape. There is the sense that the organism, when transplanted to a different milieu, will alter itself in adaptation without losing its identity. There is the marvelously intriguing notion of self-reparation by which an organism is able to rectify its own injuries or shortcomings. There is the generative aspect of an organism through which it reaches beyond itself in procreation. Finally, and in sum, there is the sense that an organism exists for itself. While a machine exists to promote a pre-existent end, an organism lives solely for its own continuity.</p>
        <p>Of these aspects the one that fascinated Eisenstein the most was that of the all-infusing life-principle. What centuries of Christianity have termed “<span>soul,</span>” and what Hegel termed “<span>idea,</span>” Eisenstein called “<span>theme</span>.” It is theme which makes an organism tend to be the way it is; theme which seems to demand that certain choices rather than others be made in the creative process. Eisenstein wrote:</p>
        <blockquote>Each <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> piece exists no longer as something unrelated, but becomes a particular representation of the general theme which in equal measure penetrates all the shot-pieces.<sup>4</sup></blockquote>
        <p>Eisenstein went on to say that in a good <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> the particular representations, when properly ordered, produce the theme which has itself brought them into being. In trying to come to grips with the difficult problem of circularity such a notion leads to, Eisenstein came back again and again to the situation of an actor. An actor exhibits a chain of gestures the combination of which promotes and finally realizes a complete image (say, that of jealousy). The small gestures which are linked together on the chain are all properly chosen by the exigency of the theme of jealousy even though that jealousy finally exists only when the chain has been completed. The mechanistic side of Eisenstein suggests that the actor from the beginning knows precisely what he wants to convey and need find only the most efficient and powerful means to encourage the audience to leap to that image. The organic side of Eisenstein rebels, claiming that the theme is invisible even to the actor until his chain of gestures has run its course, but that this theme functions all the same in choosing those tiny bits (in this case, the gestures) which make up the whole. These bits are chosen because they, and they alone out of all possible representations, contain within themselves the micro-system of the theme. For the modern reader the notion of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> “<span>cell</span>” takes on a further metaphoric significance in that each <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> piece, in addition to functioning in the overall machine of the film, has within it the signature of the genetic code which is the theme. This ensures that the cells will interact in polyphonic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> and create a “<span>monism of ensemble</span>.”</p>
        <p>Clearly the concept of organic form is attractive; but it has the danger of displacing the responsibility for the outcome of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> from the filmmaker-engineer, giving it over mystically to “<span>nature</span>.” An organicist can be tempted to reduce all discussion of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> to the statement, “<span>but this <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> grew into its proper form and it is useless to think about it further</span>.” Eisenstein never considered losing himself in such reductionism. To him the theme, as the life principle, begins directing the decisions during the filmmaking process, but that theme could not simply be plucked out of thin air. Consequently the most crucial task of filmmaking for Eisenstein is the discovery of the theme. The work such a discovery implies is tantamount to the construction of the film.</p>
        <p>To understand Eisenstein’s view of “<span>discovering the theme</span>” we must realize that for him nature does not exist in an easily available manner. This separates him immediately from the major portion of organic theorists, who feel that sheer close observation of nature yields the organic theme which is then capable of infusing an art-work with its natural energy. For Eisenstein both nature and history must be transformed by the mind before they may become true. There is no such thing as bare reality directly apprehensible. The filmmaker’s task, the task of the artist, is to apprehend the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">true</em> form of an event or natural phenomenon and then utilize that form in the construction of his artwork.</p>
        <p>An obvious example from Eisenstein’s own work will help. In 1905 there was an insurrection on the ship <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Potemkin</em> as part of the abortive revolution of that year. For a while the insurrection rallied the people of Odessa and the sailors of other ships nearby. Eisenstein believed that this event could be filmed in countless ways, but only one way would take advantage of the true form of the event. Only one <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> would be organically tied to the truth of history.</p>
        <p>The process by which a filmmaker comes to appropriate the true form of an event is not by merely recording the appearances of the event. Eisenstein had always held that to attain “<span>reality</span>” one must destroy “<span>realism,</span>” break up the appearances of a phenomenon and reconstruct them according to a “<span>reality principle</span>.” For the Marxist Eisenstein, both nature and history obey a principle of dialectical form. The filmmaker must see behind the surface realism of an event until its dialectical form becomes clear to him; only then is he able to “<span>thematicize</span>” his subject. After this, the choices he makes in both his raw material and in his <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> methods will be automatically dictated by this life principle. For his part, the spectator must re-create the theme of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as his mind energizes the “<span>attractions</span>” before him. The myriad interconections between these cells will ultimately overwhelm the spectator as both <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and spectator move toward the final image of the theme. The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is not a <em class="notranslte" translate="no">product</em> but an organically unfolding creative <em class="notranslte" translate="no">process</em> in which the audience participates both emotionally and intellectually. Eisenstein wrote, “<span>The spectator is made to traverse the road of creation the author traversed in creating the image</span>” (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Sense</em>, p. 32) and he cited Marx for support:</p>
        <blockquote>Not only the event but the road to it is part of the truth. The investigation of truth must itself be true. True investigation is unfolded truth, the disjunctive members of which unite in result (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Sense</em>, p. 32).</blockquote>
        <p>The organic analogy, in sum, displaces to some extent the origin of the form of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> from the filmmaker. Even Eisenstein recognized the inadequacy and immorality of willful <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> creation which tries to manipulate the spectator. The apprehension of the organic theme involves an understanding of reality outside of, but only by means of, the creator’s consciousness. The creative filmmaker puts himself in the position of understanding reality thematically and of being able to create a film, the intertwining lines of which render that theme. Furthermore the very lines of meaning in this <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> are made up of fragments or cells, each of which contains within it the stamp of the theme. The entire <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is of a piece, even though operating through conflict and collision. This is so because, in Eisenstein’s credo, the basic themes of life itself are reducible to conflict. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, then, while providing the mechanical energy which allows the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> machine to perform its designated task, is formally isomorphic to the organic structure of nature and of history.</p>
        <p>Eisenstein seemed satisfied with his “<span>organic-machine</span>.” Whenever he investigated the effect of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> on the spectator, he leapt toward the image of the machine. But when he turned to the relation of the artwork to reality he concentrated on the organic interrelation of the cells which make it up. While this confused many of his critics and followers, to him this was nothing other than a change in emphasis. “<span>The error,</span>” he said, “<span>lay in emphasizing possibilities of juxtaposition while less attention seemed to be paid to analyzing the material that was juxtaposed</span>” (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Sense</em>, p. 8).</p>
        <p>To sum up, Eisenstein simply wanted a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> to get things done like a machine, but he didn’t want this machine to be made out of any old parts, some engineered on the spot, others bought at a junk yard, all held together in whatever fashion seemed to work. And so he reached for nature, for the organic in which all parts are interrelated in a self-sustaining system. But this more attractive model (close to the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form dreamed of by Munsterberg and Arnheim) was necessarily “<span>useless</span>.” That which is naturally self-sustaining does not promote the revolution, not directly at any rate. Eisenstein vacillated between these two very different notions of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> form because he was never completely certain about the function or purpose of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art. We need to examine this uncertainty.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">THE FINAL PURPOSE OF FILM</h3>
        <p>Implicit in all his reflections about the form of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> are issues which concern the purpose of film. The most accessible entry into the problems for Eisenstein’s theory is through consideration of the relationships between rhetoric and autonomous art. These terms are polar opposites in most theories of art and in our culture there has been a vast normative bias in favor of art over rhetoric. It is only fair to note at the outset that, as far as I know, Eisenstein never considered his theories to be anything other than theories of art. There is not a single instance on record of his referring to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> as a rhetorical medium. Nonetheless several critics in the past have accused him of being a theorist of rhetoric and others have tried to support such a claim by analyzing his films as propaganda texts. It is helpful to sketch the issues at stake in any consideration of rhetoric versus art and to try to locate Eisenstein’s positions in transit.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Rhetoric</em></h3>
        <p>The Greeks constructed elaborate theories of rhetoric even before the science of aesthetics or the idea of art had been developed. In its broadest sense rhetoric is the science of language and communication. More specifically it is the study of the ends, methods, and effects of discourse. For our purposes we can conceive of rhetoric as the examination of discursive situations in which one party wants to convey something to someone else for the purpose of influencing him or at the very least of enlightening him.</p>
        <p>It should be obvious that any rigorously held belief in art as machine entails the classical rhetorical situation. The artwork or <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> becomes a true medium, capable of being adjusted and modified, across which a rhetor (or filmmaker) conveys his ideas with as much clarity and power as he is able. The goal of such a situation is precisely in the audience effect, be it an intellectual or an emotional effect.</p>
        <p>The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> situation is one which naturally places the rhetor in a position of absolute dominion over his audience, for there is no chance for the audience to respond in the normal sense of dialogue. The spectator indeed expects to be enlightened or moved and struggles to attain the effects which the machine of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> has been built to deliver. After all he has paid $2 to feel the effects which someone in Hollywood has created with $2 million. In addition, because the medium of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is technological, the spectator is even more disposed to accept his role as recipient of effect. A rhetor is speaking with the authority by means of a mysterious apparatus which confers on him special power.</p>
        <p>Most of Eisenstein’s early writings on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> indicate that he accepted this situation and wanted to exploit it as fully as he could. He was appalled at how inefficient and dull most <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was, especially <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> which sought to give its audience the impression of reality. Reality, he felt, speaks very obscurely, if at all. It is up to the filmmaker to rip reality apart and rebuild it into a system capable of generating the greatest possible emotional effects. The very sense of shock <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> confirms this. In one of his most telling exclamations, one which he wrote toward the end of his career when he had greatly modified his ideas about Pavlovian shock treatment of the audience, Eisenstein still asserted an audience-oriented definition: “<span>A work of art, understood dynamically, is just this process of arranging images in the feelings and mind of the spectator</span>” (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Sense</em>, p. 17).</p>
        <p>Eisenstein’s theory could readily be interpreted as a theory of propaganda. What is the purpose of propaganda films and TV commercials, other than cleverly to arrange images in the feelings and minds of spectators in order to give them the greatest possible emotional effect. The effect, mapped out in advance, becomes the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">raison d’être</em> of the work of art. This situation subordinates art to its effect and encourages the view (though does not demand it) that a single effect might be rendered via two or more artworks. This would lead, naturally, to an evaluation of films based on their suitability in conveying an explicit effect.</p>
        <p>A typology of films could be drawn up according to the importance and complexity of the message or effect conveyed and according to the suitability of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> for conveying those messages. Such a theory of the purpose of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> seems apt for the major portion of cinematic texts. Many critics feel that all cinematic texts—the propaganda films of Nazi Germany, the Alka Seltzer ads of America, the films of Hitchcock and Bergman—are machines more or less successful in their task of driving home some pre-planned message or effect.</p>
        <p>It is not easy to say to what extent Eisenstein might accept this view of cinema. It does seem fairly clear that he thought art was reserved for those kinds of effects and messages not available to ordinary speech. That is, art is first of all directed at the emotions and only secondly at the reason. It delivers an effect which is not available to ordinary language. Art, then, is similar to other rhetorical media, but it is of a higher order, capable of delivering fuller messages and capable of involving the entire human being. One might say that Eisenstein was arguing that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is the greatest possible propaganda tool. While he never discussed propaganda, he did suggest often enough that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is part of a world-wide revolution in consciousness. All this implies that the filmmaker exists in a state of knowledge and that the spectator is brought from ignorance to knowledge via the power of the film, a power which energizes the body of the spectator and through it his mind. In this rhetorical view, the process of knowledge is completed before the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is made. The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> exists exclusively to channel the knowledge to a wider public, to disseminate it and to let its power work in the world.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Art</em></h3>
        <p>Ever since the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century countless claims have been made for the importance of pure art. Art was said to exist in the object itself independent of any intention which the artist might have desired or of any effect the object might have on an audience. It exists solely to be beautiful, that is, to manifest itself. Art objects have a claim to a higher state of existence than other objects because they are, first of all, purposeless and, second, proper to themselves. They are said to be suitable to the aspirations they have for themselves. If the artwork is a baroque painting, it swirls its objects into the perfect arrangement for itself. If it is a Bach fugue, it organizes the notes and lines of melody into its properly intricate pattern. What is more, this pattern is not imposed on the work from outside, as an engineer imposes a design on a machine in order to make it function according to <em class="notranslte" translate="no">his</em> wishes. No, the pattern somehow exists organically within the artwork. The artist labors until the form he creates exists as this pattern, releasing it from his control, allowing it to exist for our contemplation.</p>
        <p>While this sketch of a theory of autonomous art is terribly brief, one can already see that Eisenstein would have little to do with most of its premises. But there are several elements, especially in his later writings, which indicate that the rhetorical model was too simplistic for his tastes and that he was ransacking Romantic art theories for a way to understand the full purpose of cinema.</p>
        <p>Paramount is his meditation on the status of the image. In Eisenstein’s later writing he defined the image as any global concept capable of animating a host of representations. His example of an image is 42nd Street. This image generated in him a total feeling which could be expressed through a series of individual representations (neon signs, crowds, certain buildings, theaters, and so on). Conversely, a properly organized series of representations could generate an image. From a strictly rhetorical viewpoint, the filmmaker begins with an image and then carefully calculates the best means to transfer that image to the audience. Invariably he must resort to a proper ordering of bits (attractions) which will build up in the spectator that total feeling or image. To a large extent Eisenstein seemed to hold exactly this view, but there are indications that he also felt the image to be something which develops almost spontaneously out of the representations which the artist is manipulating. The artist thus does not begin with a total view but arrives at one, something unnamable driving him to choose certain representations and to combine them in ways which emphasize certain relationships.</p>
        <p>Eisenstein’s ambivalence on this issue is transparent in his article “<span>Word and Image</span>.” There, within the space of three hundred words, he seems to try to establish both possibilities (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> Sense</em>, pp. 30, 31). First he supports the rhetorical approach explicitly: “<span>Before the perception of the creator hovers a given image, emotionally embodying his theme. The task that confronts him is to transform this image into a few basic partial representations which, in their combination and juxtaposition, shall evoke in the consciousness and feelings of the spectator… that same initial general image which originally hovered before the creative artist</span>.”</p>
        <p>But only one paragraph later Eisenstein seems to modify the status of the image. No longer does it hover out of time. Eisenstein moves in the direction of the organicist camp when he says, “<span>The desired image is not fixed or ready-made, but arises—is born</span>.”</p>
        <p>Eisenstein never seems to have posed the problem in terms of rhetoric and art. He was far more likely to conceive of it in terms of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">speech</em> and <em class="notranslte" translate="no">inner speech</em>. All expressions affect the spectator but some do so through the clear public channels of speech while others invade the spectator’s private mental world. While all films have a purpose, only the great films avoid a simplistic <em class="notranslte" translate="no">rhetoric</em> which would proceed in the manner of speech, and in which <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is a simple theory of syntax. Great films affect their audiences in the manner of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">autonomous art</em>, and these same <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> theories this time promote the mysterious process of inner speech, that pre-linguistic patterning of phenomena which proceeds by the juxtaposition of bursts of attractions. Great films bypass conventional language which normally forces primal representations into a chain of deductive grammatical signification. In inner speech the only grammatical rule at play is association through juxtaposition. Like inner speech, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> uses a concrete language in which sense comes not from deduction but from the fullness of the individual attractions as qualified by the image which they help to develop.</p>
        <p>This kind of thinking is not entirely foreign to Marxism. Eisenstein was able to cite Lenin to help establish the claim of the strength of primal patterns. Lenin had said that the primary processes of nature, dialectic processes, manifest “<span>recurrence on the highest level of known traits, attributes, etc. of the lowest</span>” (<em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Form</em>, p. 81). This quotation comes alive when placed next to Eisenstein’s later writings.</p>
        <blockquote>Each <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> piece exists no longer as something unrelated but as a given <em class="notranslte" translate="no">particular representation</em> of the general theme that in equal measure penetrates all the shot-pieces. The juxtaposition of these partial details in a given <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> construction calls to life and forces into the light that <em class="notranslte" translate="no">general</em> quality in which each detail has participated and which binds together all the details into a <em class="notranslte" translate="no">whole</em>, namely, into that generalized <em class="notranslte" translate="no">image</em> wherein the creator, followed by the spectator, experiences the theme (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> Sense</em>, p. 11).</blockquote>
        <p>In art, as in inner speech, wholes determine, and are determined by, details. This process of coming to a self-justifying image is the process of art. We must recall here Marx’s dictum that truth lies in the path as much as in the destination. And Eisenstein, in forcing the spectator to create the image by putting together all the relationships between attractions (relationships existing because of the interpenetrating theme), gives to the spectator not a completed image, but the “<span>experience of completing an image</span>.” Such an experience yields an understanding of the theme more primal and more powerful than any appeal through normal speech and logic.</p>
        <p>At this point it is even possible to see traces of mysticism in Eisenstein’s thought. His constant curiosity about the mental processes of primitive cultures and of children stems from his belief that, by avoiding the chains of verbal logic to which we are doomed, they are naturally linked to a more <em class="notranslte" translate="no">real</em> world, one in which the mind naturally patterns the stimuli it finds in the world. When all the members of a village aid the birthing of a child by opening their doors, they are, in his view, bound closer to each other and to this <em class="notranslte" translate="no">natural</em> process than we, in our enlightened culture, can ever hope to be, except perhaps through the power of art and especially cinema.</p>
        <p>In art we are led away from logic to re-experience our primary mode of understanding. Eisenstein, like Romantic theorists of art, believes that what is primary and natural will of itself be tied to the truth. For Eisenstein, both the method (dialectical juxtaposition of thematically interpenetrated representations) and the final image which that method creates will, in the proper film, join the creators (both artist and spectator) to the true processes and themes of life.<sup>5</sup> This, he was certain, would advance that state of life most consistent with the real processes of nature and history, the dialectical movement toward the Marxist millennium. Art, then, has a mission quite different from rhetoric. It exists to manifest the correspondence between basic human perception and the basic processes of nature and history. This cannot be accomplished by a carefully reasoned system, but by the nearly mystical showing forth of the artwork itself which, by being perfectly itself, mediates between man and nature.</p>
        <p>In the Marxist state Eisenstein felt that art would reinforce the culture, since that culture is already based on proper dialectical principles, coordinated from the first with the processes of mind and nature. In pre-revolutionary societies like ours, true art must necessarily be an insurgent force destined to manifest, at the level of perception and imagination, the antinomies of a society not in tune with man and nature. Art, therefore, can still change behavior by changing perception, but it does so indirectly, as a natural by-product of simply being itself. Rhetoric, on the other hand, exists for no other reason than to make specific changes in knowledge or behavior.</p>
        <p>While Eisenstein desperately wanted such changes, he gradually thought of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art as something higher and more lasting. He thought of it not so much as deliverer of a truth (rhetoric) but as a general image of the truth (art). While an art machine built to rally the proletariat behind the 5-year plan of 1925 might today be ineffective, an art organism which grew into an image of the truth in 1925 can be rediscovered by every generation.</p>
        <p>In a real sense Eisenstein’s <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory has also embodied this dialectic of machine and organism. Most of his essays were written as part of an aesthetic war in Russia, as apologies for certain kinds of filmmaking and as attacks on other kinds. They were rhetorical in the fullest sense of the word. Yet his theory as a whole seems to have an organic life as well. Whenever his essays are translated into a new language one can trace their impact on the attitudes of still another group of theorists and filmmakers.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most striking example of the perpetual power of Eisenstein’s theory comes to us from recent French <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> culture. Until the mid-1960s André Bazin’s views were unrivalled. They dominated the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> journals and they had an important effect on the most influential films of the New Wave. Bazin and his generation in France knew of Eisenstein only from secondary sources and from a few uncollected essays that had found their way into the French language. With the massive translation projects of the late sixties, Bazin’s grip on the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory of France was loosened. Eisenstein’s ideas today are heard everywhere in Paris. They dominate the major journals, <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Cahiers du cinéma</em> and <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Cinéthique</em>. They are evident in the dynamic cutting style of recent French movies. In short they have been integrated into, and have helped foster, a new radical <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> consciousness. Because of the boldness of its formulation, Eisenstein’s theory will always be instrumental to radical views of cinema, but because of the honesty of its constant self-qualification his theory will outlast every use to which it is put.</p>

        <h2 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Béla Balázs and the Tradition of Formalism</em></h2>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">A SUMMARY OF FORMATIVE <span class="notranslate" translate="no">FILM</span> THEORY</h3>
        <p>Béla Balázs’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of Film</em> is one of the first and unquestionably one of the best introductions to the art. It has been followed by numerous imitators, each trying to provide a wide audience with a basic grasp of the potentials of the medium. In this chapter the whole enterprise of formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory will be put under a critical light so that we can understand the premises of such introductory <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> books and, more importantly, to see why Balázs’s book is among the very best.</p>
        <p>The figures we have examined thus far are doubtless the most interesting and valuable members of the formative tradition. Munsterberg and Arnheim impress us because of the deep philosophic heritage which actively supports their theories. Eisenstein stands above even these men not only because of the diversity and originality of his writings, but also because he struggled all his life to avoid the simplistic reductionism which formalist theory tempts one to adopt. We saw that he had the courage to go beyond his initial theoretical discoveries in order to seek solutions which would account for more subtle aspects of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> experience.</p>
        <p>In general the countless lesser figures following the general direction of formative thought have had neither the tenacity and vision of Eisenstein nor the philosophic discipline of Arnheim and Munsterberg. Consequently most formative theory is predictable, often tiresomely so.</p>
        <p>There have been two major periods of prolific formative theory. The first came between 1920 and 1935 when an entire intellectual class became conscious that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (especially silent cinema) was not merely a sociological phenomenon of extraordinary importance, but a powerful art form with the same kinds of rights and responsibilities as any other art form. These theorists wanted to make known the properties of this new medium in order to help explain the mysterious success of the great silent films and to help direct future <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> toward greater power and greater maturity. The second major period of formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory began in the early 1960s and is still growing today. This period draws its strength from the burgeoning academic interest in film. Our classrooms are teeming with students demanding to know the secrets of the screen, and introductory textbooks by the score, all of them necessarily in the formative tradition, have appeared to answer this student need.</p>
        <p>Characteristically such books are divided into chapters based on the technical variables of film. There are always chapters on composition, camera, lighting, editing, sound, color, and often one on acting. Each chapter enumerates the various possibilities for artistic control in its domain, underscoring the “<span>unnatural</span>” (or specifically “<span>cinematic</span>”) aspects of the medium. In one sense all such books are the offspring (desired or not) of Arnheim’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film</span> as Art</em>. Most make copious references to artistically successful films to prove the validity of the cinematic facets they are treating. Meaningful color is described in Michelangelo Antonioni’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Red Desert</em>. Artistic use of lighting is analyzed with reference to Fritz Lang’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">M</em> or Carl Dreyer’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Day of Wrath</em>. In all cases we are shown the solution to a problem in signification which a director found by manipulating one or another technical aspect.</p>
        <p>There is always something hollow about this kind of approach. Formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory is dangerous for the same reason it is attractive: it is centered entirely on the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">technique</em> of film. When this focus is not supported by proper illumination of the issues pertinent to cinematic form and purpose, the result is a mere rubric for possible uses of the medium rather than a full and consistent theory.</p>
        <p>Nearly all introductory texts of this sort give themselves ballast by drawing an implicit analogy between <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and language. They deny being simple rubrics and claim instead to construct visual dictionaries and grammars, arming the student with the vocabulary and syntax necessary “<span>to read</span>” the various kinds of signification at play in the techniques of every film. The titles of many such books betray this intention: <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Grammar of Film, The Language of Film, The Rhetoric of Film</em>, etc.</p>
        <p>Certainly <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has some relationship to language and can be profitably considered a language in some senses: nevertheless, as Christian Metz, Jean Mitry, and others have shown, its relation to verbal language is not direct and is at best partial and complex. To draw an analogy between these media without confronting the limitations of the analogy is to fail to theorize.</p>
        <p>Beyond the grave difficulty inherent in trying to discuss a liquid and physically multi-layered medium as if it were a digital, homogeneous system like language, there is the very dangerous implication in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> language primers that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is a closed finite system, like a keyboard, on which the director plays whatever melody he has in mind. This turns the filmmaking process into a formula of “<span>correct choices,</span>” choices proper to the message at hand. It was against this mechanical and digital tendency in his own thought that Eisenstein fought so long a battle. He knew well enough that a stringent formalism chains the artist and tends to dictate the look of films from the outside.</p>
        <p>At its most simplistic, formative theory must inevitably place a premium on the sheer visibility of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> language. Filmmakers whose techniques are striking are ranked above more subtle filmmakers,<sup>1</sup> for by itself a technically oriented theory can never differentiate the aesthetic value of a Robert Bresson <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> from any given TV commercial. There is in fact more technical “<span>art</span>” (visible techniques) in one Pepsi-Cola ad than in all of Bresson’s films. Without a thoroughgoing sense of shape and purpose, formative theory provides us with nothing but a catalogue of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> effects, and this is hardly sufficient for a theory of cinema.</p>
        <p>To understand formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory in its full dimensions we have to go outside <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory proper, just as we went to neo-Kantianism to situate Munsterberg’s theory and to Gestalt psychology for Arnheim’s. To achieve the broadest view of the whole enterprise of formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory, to see its implicit world vision, we must look to Russian Formalist poetics.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">RUSSIAN FORMALISM</h3>
        <p>Is it sheer coincidence that the dates of the Russian Formalist movement (1918–30) coincide so neatly with those of the first age of formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory? No doubt. But certainly Sergei Eisenstein was deeply influenced by their work and Arnheim and Balázs were well aware of them. More striking still, the Russian Formalist doctrines have been revived, widely translated, and openly celebrated since the early 1960s, precisely at the birth of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> semiotics and the ascendancy of formative theory in our classrooms.</p>
        <p>Aside from these intriguing historical relations, Russian Formalism gives to formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory the large philosophic context in which we need to see it. While not all formative theorists might accept them, the Russian Formalist positions are perfectly consistent with formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory. Primarily a theory of poetic language, Russian Formalism sets out an entire theory of human activity. What is it, the Formalists ask, which makes the artistic or aesthetic aspects of a man’s life so different and so special? To answer this they first established a system of four categories of functions which, they claim, account for every possible human activity. Every action we perform belongs to one or more of the following functions: practical, theoretic, symbolic, and aesthetic.</p>
        <p>The practical category concerns those objects or actions which serve an immediate use. (Highways and their construction enable us to get from one city to another.) The theoretical category comprises all objects and actions which function for general and unspecified uses. (Microbiology serves, and will serve, many purposes related to human health.) In the symbolic category a given object or activity functions in the place of another object or activity. (The marriage ritual stands for and objectifies the binding of two lives.) Last of all there is the aesthetic function which, oddly enough, includes those objects and activities which function for no purpose whatsoever. They exist for themselves, for pure contemplation and perception.</p>
        <p>A single object or activity may serve various functions. For example, an Egyptian key coming from the Xllth Dynasty once served the practical function of opening a door. Today it is placed under a glass case in a museum as a purely aesthetic object. Our language, to take another example, generally serves a symbolic function, requiring that we go beyond it to that which it represents. In poetry, however, the Formalists contend that language exists for itself.</p>
        <p>Now the aesthetic category operates in many areas of life, not all of which we call art. A mathematician may perform his activity for sheerly aesthetic purposes. A panorama in nature may be viewed entirely without motive, sheerly for itself. Art is the name we give to activities which fashion purposeless objects, objects which do nothing but exist for our intense perception and contemplation.</p>
        <p>Victor Shklovsky, one of the most prominent Russian Formalists and a friend and biographer of Eisenstein, summarizes these ideas perfectly:</p>
        <blockquote>Art exists that one may recover the sensation of life; it exists to make one feel things, to make the stone <em class="notranslte" translate="no">stony</em>. The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects “<span>unfamiliar</span>” to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object; the object itself is not important.<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
        <p>Most early <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory neatly fits itself into this vision of art and life. The theorists whom I have labeled “<span>formative</span>” all believe that the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> serves a symbolic function when it simply reproduces reality. It serves an aesthetic function when it forces us to attend in a special way (via its unnatural techniques) to that reality.</p>
        <p>In 1926 the artist and exprimental filmmaker Fernand Léger lamented the fact that most films waste their efforts in trying to build a recognizable world, neglecting all the while “<span>the powerful spectacular effect of the object. … The possibility of the fragment</span>.”<sup>3</sup> Léger of course created the famous <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Ballet méchanique</em> in which everyday practical objects, like knives and spoons, are set against one another to produce a rhythmic pattern of perceptual forms. As Shklovsky proclaimed, these everyday objects become unimportant while at the same time they impart to us the experience of their “<span>artfulness</span>.”</p>
        <p>A few years later the American critic Harry Alan Potamkin, who visited Russia during the period of the Formalist hegemony, claimed, “<span>To make the material significant he [the filmmaker] must break the continuity of vision,</span>”<sup>4</sup> must make us see the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> not as a mere substitute for a real world but as an image existing for significant perception. Hans Richter, one of the great avant-garde artists of the twenties, summed up these notions: “<span>The main aesthetic problem for the movies, which were invented for reproduction, is, paradoxically, the overcoming of reproduction</span>.”<sup>5</sup></p>
        <p>We have already noted that Eisenstein rejected the long take because its purpose is always “<span>the continuity of vision,</span>” the impulse toward sheer “<span>reproduction</span>” scoffed at by Potamkin and Richter. And Arnheim, for his part, clearly stated,</p>
        <blockquote>No representation of an object will ever be valid visually and artistically unless the eyes can directly understand it as a <em class="notranslte" translate="no">deviation</em> from the basic visual conception of the object.<sup>6</sup></blockquote>
        <p>Arnheim’s vocabulary here corresponds exactly with that of the Russian Formalists for whom the technique of art was always based on deviation. “<span>Make the object strange!</span>” they cried. For them art was never a matter of significant content, inspiration, imagination, or whatever else people have put at the heart of the artistic endeavor. It was precisely technique; that is, the perception, the labor, and the sheer talent which can take an object or activity and wrench it from the flow of life. In stopping to regard this object we are struck by its visible shape, struck, the Formalists say, by the technique itself which stands before us.</p>
        <p>The overall process whereby technique calls attention to the object is termed <em class="notranslte" translate="no">defamiliarization</em>. The Formalists were quick to praise those artworks which emphasize this process. In one of the most notorious formalist articles, Shklovsky held up Sterne’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Tristram Shandy</em> as the paradigm of the literary object.<sup>7</sup> <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Tristram Shandy</em> is a novel in which the reader is continually notified that he is involved in a literary experience. Sterne makes it nearly impossible for us to relate his book to the outside world. We are left with an aesthetic object, the enjoyment of which is a product of our perception of the literary process itself, of literary <em class="notranslte" translate="no">technique</em> itself.</p>
        <p>Boris Tomashevsky, taking his cue from Shklovsky, generalized this process by cataloguing various literary techniques and pointing out how each technique forces art away from the representation of reality.<sup>8</sup> He distilled plot (technique) from story (reality), motivation (technique) from general causality (reality), etc. He concluded that all literary techniques which we regard as artistic (irony, humor, pathos, figures of speech) function as conscious distortions of reality. One can see immediately how close this position is to Arnheim’s.</p>
        <p>A second wave of literary Formalism, which flourished in Prague in the late twenties and early thirties, further refined the concept of defamiliarization by introducing the notion of “<span>foregrounding</span>.” Artistic speech, these Formalists said, is speech which lifts itself outside the readily understandable (the clearly codified) and stands solidly in front of the reader’s eyes. He cannot avoid it because it is simultaneously different and difficult. They saw every artwork as a construction of various sorts of artistic speech and judged each by its success in foregrounding itself.</p>
        <p>The relationship between these literary concepts and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory is unmistakable at this point. Tomashevsky’s emphasis on the exaggerated detail and Jan Mukarovsky’s delineation of foregrounding have direct counterparts in the cinematic close-shot. Several <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> critics, most notable among them the East European Béla Balázs, establish cinema’s claims to art in its capacity for the close-up, “<span>for the pictorial forming of details</span>”.<sup>9</sup></p>
        <p>The spatial metaphor of foregrounding has its temporal counterpart in the notion of rhythm which is, predictably enough, another central concept of the Formalists. Just as we can associate the filmic close-up with foregrounding, so we can put <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> together with rhythm. Allardyce Nicoll, when speaking of the Russian films of the twenties, said, “<span>If cutting is prose, then <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> is poetry</span>.”<sup>10</sup></p>
        <p>In the extreme, this view of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is one which feels that the artistic is that which works in direct opposition to the prosaic. This follows precisely Shklovsky’s dictum that “<span>poetry is <em class="notranslte" translate="no">attenuated, tortuous</em> speech,</span>” and his conception of rhythm as a “<span>disordering which cannot be predicted,</span>”<sup>11</sup> but which continually invites mistaken prediction. Compare Shklovsky to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorists like Dallas Bower for whom <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> rhythms “<span>break up the omnipresent flux … to produce a new artificial time superimposed as it were on real time</span>”<sup>12</sup> or to Potamkin for whom rhythms are “<span>repetitions, repetitions in variation, the progressive <em class="notranslte" translate="no">deformation</em> of a theme</span>.”<sup>13</sup> And finally we have Jean Cocteau’s epigram: “<span>My primary concern is to prevent the images from flowing, to oppose them, to anchor them and join them without destroying their relief</span>.”<sup>14</sup></p>
        <p>There lies within these notions of defamiliarization, foregrounding, deformation, and deviation the possibility of a gross and dangerous exaggeration. Shklovsky to a great extent implied that only foregrounded material is artistic. Now this formulation can lead to some rather bizarre misconceptions. For instance, from this it could be asserted that a particular poem or <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> contains exactly thirty (or <em class="notranslte" translate="no">n</em>) artistic moments built upon its prose background. Should a work of art be judged by its density of foregrounding?</p>
        <p>Few Formalists have been willing to go this far because such a notion implies a quantitative notion of aesthetic value. Few would consider T. S. Eliot’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Waste Land</em> a more poetic work than Alexander Pope’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Rape of the Lock</em> simply because it breaks up the struck by its visible shape, struck, the Formalists say, by the technique itself which stands before us.</p>

Eliot’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Waste Land</em> a more poetic work than Alexander Pope’s <em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Rape of the Lock</em> simply because it breaks up the prose meaning more often and in more varied ways. Yet Formalists have always been tempted to rank artworks bearing ostentatious technique above more subtle kinds of artworks. In effect Formalism has been tempted to become a partisan of a particular style of art rather than a philosophy applicable to artworks of all styles.</p>
        <p>In both <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theory and literary theory there have been Formalists who have fought this temptation. Jan Mukarovsky, a major critic of the Prague school, was quick to see that the densest possible artwork would succeed in foregrounding everything, completely eliminating the background.<sup>15</sup> In this case all relief would be lost and nothing whatsoever would really stand out. For him foregrounding is that which makes the aesthetic object stand away from the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">world</em> rather than the specific elements within an artwork which oppose themselves to the rest of the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">artwork</em>. The style of the work depends upon the kinds of foregrounding employed in relation to a specific background, but sheer quantity of foregrounding can never make an object “<span>more aesthetic</span>.” An object is either viewed aesthetically or not, and it is enough for an artwork to have one and only one instance of deformation within it to make us view it aesthetically as a whole.</p>
        <p>It is possible, therefore, to believe that art separates itself from the world by techniques of defamiliarization without implying that “<span>more deviation equals more art</span>.” Mukarovsky and his Prague colleagues developed the concepts of aesthetic “<span>norm</span>” and aesthetic “<span>value</span>” to deal with the specific situations of individual artworks. This more fluid Formalism allowed them to maintain a descriptive rather than an evaluative position and to deal with artworks of all sorts. When we study the kinds and amounts of foregrounding within various artworks we are studying and comparing styles. Style is nothing other than a specific strategy of technique; and technique, Shklovsky said, is art itself. Formalism, then, tempts one to set “<span>highly visible</span>” styles above more naturalistic ones but does not, I think, demand this hierarchy. While most formative <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorists have succumbed to this temptation, there have been from the first some writers who strove to avoid the reductionism which is its major pitfall. One of the very earliest and certainly most influential of such theorists was Béla Balázs.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">BÉLA BALÁZS</h3>
        <p>Balázs’s first writings on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> appeared as early as 1922. In the thirties and forties he was to add thoughts he developed while lecturing in the Soviet Union. The volume of his writings popularly available, <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, organizes both his early and later essays into a systematic whole. Unquestionably, Balázs’s book today looks largely unoriginal because it covers the same technical ground as so many other introductions to film. But despite the historical fact that his was virtually the first such text, Balázs’s work stands out for its clarity and caution. He surrounded his remarks on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> technique with a host of ideas concerning film’s origin and purpose, and he added to this broad perspective the passion of one who believes that a complete theory of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is necessary to guide <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to more fruitful paths.</p>
        <p>Balázs opened his book with a look at the genesis of film. His purpose was to narrow his subject to that of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art, or what he called the “<span>language-form</span>” of cinema. In this he resembled both Munsterberg and Arnheim, but unlike them he went about his inquiry by analyzing the economic infrastructure of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> which he, as a Marxist, insisted was at the basis of this new art.</p>
        <p><span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art could grow, he stated, only when business conditions allowed it to. Because it was at the mercy of theater managers trying to fill a need for novel entertainment, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was in competition with vaudeville, music hall, and popular theater, and in order to compete with live entertainment, <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> promoters were forced to look for subjects which <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> alone could render. For this reason nature was quickly brought onto the screen as an active participant in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> dramas. Even the stars of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> were not the full-throated actors of the stage, but rather animals, children, and other “<span>more natural subjects</span>.” In slapstick comedy, to use another example, multiple takes were used to produce spectacles of motion and magic impossible on the live stage. All these subjects were proper and natural to film, Balázs said, but they did not yet add up to a new art. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was still primarily photographed theater, competing with theater only in the domain of subject matter. Balázs posed the next questions clearly:</p>
        <blockquote>When and how did cinematography turn into a specific independent art employing methods sharply differing from those of the theater and using a totally different form-language? What is the difference between photographed theater and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art? Both being equally motion pictures projected on a screen, why do I say that the one is only a technical reproduction and the other an independently creative art? (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 30).</blockquote>
        <p>To answer them Balázs did a short comparative analysis of the two media. He defined the theatrical situation as one which always maintains its action in a spatial continuity separated from the spectator by a stable distance. Furthermore, the spectator views this action and this space from one unchanging angle. While photographed theater often varied distance and angle between the scenes of a drama, every event (or complete scene) unrolled without change. Hence, the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> situation was essentially the same as that of the theater, until these conditions began to be questioned. It was D. W. Griffith, in Balázs’s view, who created the new form-language of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> by breaking scenes up into fragments, shifting the distance and angle of the camera from fragment to fragment, and especially by assembling his <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> not as a linkage of scenes but as a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> of fragments.</p>
        <p>For Balázs the form-language of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was a natural product of the oscillation between subject matter and technical form. Economic factors made the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> seek new subjects, but these subjects (chases, children, nature and its wonders) in their turn demanded the utilization of new techniques such as the close-up and montage. A form-language quickly emerged from these techniques and that language itself started to dictate the kinds of subjects and stories suitable to cinema. Like so many theorists after him, Balázs believed that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> achieved full maturity in the twenties: in that era proper subjects were presented in proper cinematic form, all aiding the development of a rejuvenated popular culture, a culture no longer dependent on words, but sensitized to the emanations of a visibly expressive world.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">THE RAW MATERIAL OF <span class="notranslate" translate="no">FILM</span> ART</h3>
        <p>Like Arnheim, Balázs recognized that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has numerous functions, but it was only the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">art</em> of the cinema, harboring as it does this revolutionary potential for cultural rejuvenation, which seemed worth his attention.</p>
        <p>Balázs’s awareness of the origin of the aesthetic use of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> enabled him to elaborate quite rapidly his theory of its form-language and to make predictions and suggestions for the future. The cinematic process for him, as for all formative theorists, involves the creation of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art out of the stuff of the world. The raw material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> is not exactly reality itself but is instead the “<span>filmic subject</span>” which presents itself to one’s experience in the world and which offers itself to be transformed into cinema.</p>
        <p>This notion of “<span>filmic subject</span>” is both curious and unique. As a Marxist, Balázs had a firm belief in the reality and independence of the external world of sensation. Art never grasps reality in itself because art always brings to this world its own human patterns and human meanings. Reality, though, is multifaceted and open to many uses. Each art deals with reality in its own manner and takes for its subjects just those aspects of reality which can be readily transformed by its special means. A novelist, painter, and filmmaker may all be present at the same historical event but each will transform this event in his own way, dictated largely by his medium. No one of these media can claim to grasp the reality of the event, though all make use of it.</p>
        <p>Balázs’s view of artistic raw material is neatly revealed by his remarks about adaptation. The filmmaker who delves into another artwork for his subject matter does nothing wrong so long as he tries to reshape it via the form-language of cinema. (On this point Balázs couldn’t be further from the position of André Bazin, who urged that filmmakers forget their precious form-language and put themselves at the service of the masterpieces they want to bring to the screen.) Balázs admits that the adaptation of masterpieces by his method has not proved fruitful. Think of the many versions of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Moby Dick</em>. They are disappointing not because adaptation in itself is impossible but because a masterpiece is a work whose subject ideally suits its medium. Any transformation of this work will inevitably produce a less satisfactory result. Balázs would never accept Bazin’s solution to this problem because it amounts to a suppression of the “<span>properly cinematic</span>” and makes <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> merely a handmaiden of the other arts. Instead Balázs counsels the adaptation of mediocre works which are more likely to have within them the possibility of cinematic transformation. He can point to innumerable cheap novels and plays which have made magnificent films because the adaptor saw within them a truly cinematic subject, films like <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Birth of a Nation, Touch of Evil, Psycho, The Searchers</em>, and <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Treasure of Sierra Madre</em>.</p>
        <p>So great is Balázs’s respect for the proper selection of cinematic subjects that he gives to the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> script itself the stature of an independent work of art. Just as we consider Shakespeare’s plays fully realized even when they are not produced, so Balázs felt that the completed <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> script could, on occasion, be read as a full transformation of reality. In this he surely contradicts most other theorists. While this is by no means an important aspect of his overall theory, it does illustrate Balázs’s unique belief that the raw material of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is not something which lies dormant for any man to use. Cinematic raw material exists only for those who have the talent and energy to seek it out in their experience.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">THE CREATIVE POTENTIAL OF <span class="notranslate" translate="no">FILM</span> TECHNIQUE</h3>
        <p>Compared to the other theorists we have studied, Balázs’s sense of cinema’s raw material is practically undeveloped. Saying that filmmakers should always go to properly cinematic subjects for their material simply passes the question on to a further level of generality: what indeed is properly cinematic material?</p>
        <p>It was Balázs’s sense of the continuity of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> process which allowed him to treat this question in so hazy a fashion. For him cinematic subject matter naturally produced, and in turn was produced by, cinematic techniques. Proper subjects are those which can most fully and revealingly be transformed by the various techniques of cinema. The Russian Formalists would have fully supported him here. Like them, Balázs was most comfortable in the domain of creative process.</p>
        <p>Most of Balázs’s ideas about <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> technique correspond quite closely to Arnheim’s, for both feel that all vision is formative. Both see the screen as a pictorial frame within which the filmmaker organizes his subjects into significant and signifying patterns. And while Balázs was, unlike Arnheim, an ardent proponent of new cinematic inventions, he insisted that they be used for their formative rather than realistic potential. Many of his attacks on the gross representationalism to which sound was immediately put read as if they were written by Arnheim. But Balázs was as open to technology as Eisenstein. He knew that great filmmakers could make extraordinary use of the device which Hollywood merely slapped alongside its images. His prophecies about sound even pre-dated Eisenstein’s:</p>
        <blockquote>Only when the sound <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> will have resolved noise into its elements, segregated individual, intimate voices, and made them speak to us separately in vocal, accoustic close-up; when these isolated detail-sounds will be collated again in purposeful order by sound <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, then will the sound <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> have become a new art (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, pp. 198, 199).</blockquote>
        <p>Balázs’s vision of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> technique was completely based on the belief that films are not pictures of reality but rather the humanization of nature, since the very landscapes we choose as backgrounds for our dramas are the products of the cultural patterns within us. This notion, which has been taken up most recently by the extreme left-wing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> journals of France, finds its source in Russian Formalism. Since all vision is in a serious sense cultural rather than natural, the artist does reality no great disservice when he distorts and deforms it. Through his distortion he may in fact physically stretch the visual patterns within the minds of his spectators until they are able to see reality anew.</p>
        <blockquote>Only by means of unaccustomed and unexpected methods produced by striking set-ups can old, familiar and therefore never seen things hit our eye with new impressions (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 93).</blockquote>
        <p>But when it came to applying the theory of visual distortion Balázs quickly became conservative. Over and over he insisted that distortion must always be used in relation to a naturalistic context of background.</p>
        <blockquote>Distortion … must always be distortion of something. If that something is no longer present in the picture then the meaning and significance of the distortion is also gone (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 102).</blockquote>
        <p>Balázs asked for strange angles only to the extent that the spectator can still orient himself in the picture and differentiate the familiar from the strange. For example he was eager to allow subjective shots, including entire dream sequences, as long as such narrative and visual distortion was set against an orderly plot which it commented upon or advanced. His position here can in some ways be related to that of Mukarovsky, mentioned above, for whom a superfluity of foregrounding reduces rather than enhances aesthetic perception.</p>
        <p>One can begin to surmise Balázs’s view of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> practices; nevertheless it would be hard to predict the extent of the support he gave to every effort to shape the subject through manipulative cutting,</p>
        <blockquote>The shots are assembled by the editor in a pre-determined order in such a way as to produce by the very sequence of frames a certain intended effect, much as the fitter assembles the parts of a machine so as to turn these disjointed parts into a power-producing, work-performing machine (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 118).</blockquote>
        <p>Eisenstein never came out for so openly a mechanistic theory of montage. Balázs went on to enumerate the kinds of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> possible in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and did not neglect the “<span>inner-speech</span>” ideal Eisenstein was striving for.</p>
        <blockquote>Good <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> … starts trains of ideas and gives them a definite direction. … In such films we can see a sort of inner <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> of associations running within the human consciousness (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 124).</blockquote>
        <p>But when it came to the extremes of metaphorical and intellectual <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span>, Balázs pulled up, and he did so by explicitly attacking what he considered excessive in Eisenstein. Concentrating on the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> <em class="notranslte" translate="no">October</em> he decried visual “<span>hieroglyphic picture-writing in which the pictures mean something but have no content of their own</span>.” Eisenstein, he said, had “<span>fallen victim to the mistaken idea that the world of purely conceptual thinking could be conquered by <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art</span>” (p. 128). Here the nature of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> technique prohibits the use of a certain kind of subject matter, for Balázs readily accepted those figures of speech in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> which come naturally out of the images themselves. He appreciated Eisenstein’s work in the last section of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Potemkin</em> where an unmistakable analogy is drawn between the men on the ship and the engines which power that ship. Both terms of the figure (the men and the engine) in this case arise directly from the subject and story. The mind apprehends the comparison in passing, seizing the relationship present in the world being filmed. But this is something else again from the willful joining of dramatically unmotivated terms, such as the fall of the Tsar and the crash of a statue, in a famous <span class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</span> from <em class="notranslte" translate="no">October</em>. While the mind may readily associate the statue and the power of the Tsar, Balázs decried this misuse of what he thought was an essentially visual and dramatic (rather than conceptual) medium.</p>
        <p>Balázs’s caution, however, only extended so far. He was certainly no proponent of some mystifying realistic cinema. He was in full accord with both Eisenstein and the Russian Formalists that the artist must be bold enough to display his techniques, so that the audience be not tempted to look through the work to a supposed “<span>reality</span>” behind it. Fades, dissolves, and other narrative punctuation graphically indicate that the images are of human construction, meant not to stand for reality but to criticize it or respond to it. Yet even here Balázs stopped short of a rigorously formalistic approach. He insisted that cinematic conventions, like the fades which open and close sequences, maintain a naturalistic relationship to mental processes. Dissolves and fades, in other words, are “<span>like</span>” the mental processes by which we move from image to image in our own inner worlds. Such techniques are conventions, to be sure, but rather realistic ones and preferable in his view to such other conventions as the wipe, “<span>those curtains of shadows … drawn across the picture, … an admission of impotence … contrary to the spirit of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art</span>” (p. 153).</p>
        <p>(figure)</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">Crashing statue in October, 1928. <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Blackhawk Films</em></h3>
        <p>And so Balázs, while recognizing the conventional and formative nature of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> techniques, nevertheless consistently appealed to filmmakers to use their techniques diligently and always in relation to our everyday vision, building filmic signification out of the normal world of sight and sound. He frequently used standard Marxist rhetoric to attack the indulgence of overly distorted films which obfuscate the primacy of normal perception and create strange visual and temporal universes. Such films, he said, are a “<span>degenerative phenomenon of bourgeois art</span>”; they have “<span>peeled facial expression off the face and physiognomy off the object, creating abstract, floating ‘expressions’ that no longer express anything</span>” (p. 108). Less committed to pure shape than were the Russian Formalists, Balázs wanted to retain the status of the object and lift it to signification by means of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> technique. His interest continually returned to those original objects which for Shklovsky and the other Formalists ceased to matter the moment the artist touched them.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">CINEMATIC SHAPE OR FORM</h3>
        <p><em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em> was divided into two sections by its author. The first section, primarily a call to the understanding of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as a new language-form, concentrated heavily on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> technique. Part Two began with a consideration of the various genres of film. It is in this section that Balázs examined the <em class="notranslte" translate="no">formal</em> principles which shape the language of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> into actual examples of cinema. The importance accorded cinematic form by Balázs cannot be overestimated.</p>
        <blockquote>A stone on the hillside and the stone of one of Michelangelo’s sculptures are both stone. As stones their material is more or less the same. It is not the substance but the form that constitutes the difference between them. … It is an old canon of art that the spirit and the law of a material manifests itself most perfectly in the constructed forms of a work of art and not in the raw material (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 161).</blockquote>
        <p>Balázs proposed to study the forms of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> by examining what he considered to be marginal genres. He hoped that by looking at its extremes, he would be able to see the laws and rules of cinematic shape. For Balázs the outer regions of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> had been colonized on one side by the avant-garde or abstract <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and, on the other, by the pure documentary. Between them lie the more conventional genres of fictional film, news and educational film, and personal documentary. It is, however, the outlying genres which always test our beliefs and it is to them that he directed his attention.</p>
        <p>At both ends of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> spectrum Balázs found forms which intentionally avoid story. “<span>On the one hand the intention was to show objects without form and on the other to show form without objects. This tendency led on the one hand to the cult of the documentary <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> and on the other to toying with objectless forms</span>” (p. 174).</p>
        <p>Balázs’s very tone is indicative of his conservative formalism. The pure documentary, in trying to avoid a particular story, loses its voice entirely and is dumb. It is like the uncarved rock on the hillside, rude and virtually meaningless. The purely abstract film, on the other end of the continuum, had gone beyond story in its search for “<span>absolute share,</span>” thereby losing touch with the reality it should interpret.</p>
        <p>Balázs opened his argument by outlining with the greatest of sympathy the rationale of the “<span>pure documentary</span>.” It hopes, he said, to “<span>penetrate so deeply to the core of life, reproduce so vividly the raw material of reality, as to find sufficient expressive dramatic elements in it without a need for a constructive ‘plot,’</span>” (p. 156) let alone preliminary scripts and scenarios. But everything in Balázs’s philosophy argues against such an ingenuous approach. For him, as for Eisenstein, reality wasn’t something one could grasp naïvely. Filmmakers must find truth in the incomprehensibility and noise of reality; and they must set this truth free so that it can speak. This process requires both talent and energy; it almost always demands a plot and a firm control of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> technique.</p>
        <blockquote>In order that out of the empirical fog of reality the truth—that is, the law and meaning of reality-may emerge through the interpretation of a seeing and experiencing maker, such a maker must bring into play every means of expression available to the art of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 162).</blockquote>
        <p>Even granting that photography can capture reality (and we have seen that Balázs had serious reservations about this claim), bare reality was for him insufficient. Like Eisenstein and all formative theorists, he had a tendency to place <span class="notranslate" translate="no">editing</span> far above photography. “<span>Single pictures are mere reality. Only <span class="notranslate" translate="no">montage</span> turns them into truths or falsehoods</span>” (p. 162). Here Balázs took his stand against realists like Kracauer and Bazin. For both of them reality could never be termed “<span>mere,</span>” and photography, they would have said, is its handmaid.</p>
        <p>But of course Balázs’s attacks were launched not against realist <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> theorists so much as against extreme tendencies in filmmaking. The Kino-Eye newsreels of Dziga Vertov, for instance, irritated him primarily because of their claim to superior objectivity. Balázs found such <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> thoroughly subjective, for the spectator is at the mercy of the cameraman’s whims. This cameraman, for his part, tries not to render up truths about reality, nor even an objective view of it, but rather the continuity of vision which he himself supplies. It is only this personal continuity which joins the various images in such a film. How subjective can a movie get, Balázs asked! And how tyrannical.</p>
        <p>While his argument may seem rather harsh, Balázs tempered his tone with characteristic equanimity and understanding. This time his understanding was personal, for he himself had made at least one “<span>hero-less</span>” documentary (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">The Adventures of a Ten Mark Note)</em>. He recognized the value of the desire to have done with the run-of-the-mill <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> which “<span>strings the characteristic events of life on the slender thread of a single human destiny</span>” (p. 159). The documentarist wants to avoid the appearance of the artificial so that his subject does not look like the “<span>mere invention of some scriptwriter</span>.”</p>
        <p>With some regret Balázs undermined this naïve desire, calling not only for scripted films but for films based on specific human dramas. Without particular dramas, human experience cannot be organized, for it never exists in the mass. Even films which strive to engender social awareness and action do best to couch their philosophies within small human dramas, showing social concern emerging in an individual rather than in a faceless crowd. Most likely it is the primacy Balázs always accorded to the facial close-up which led him to this conclusion. But we should never forget that he was writing during the age of Soviet socialist realism, a movement promoting simple personal social dramas and specifically condemning the “<span>formalistic</span>” mass epics of the early Eisenstein.</p>
        <p>If Balázs was disturbed by pure documentary’s tendency to edge <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> from its proper narrative path, he was outraged by the goals of avant-gardism. For here the technical capability of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> absolutely dictates what should be filmed, what can be seen. Films of mere appearance result, whose principle of continuity lies in some abstract law. Such films try to “<span>produce not the soul in the world, but the world in the soul</span>” (p. 179). Balázs’s vocabulary here has recently been taken up by avant-gardists like Stan Brakhage who turn it around to support their aesthetic. Abstract films to his displeasure and Brakhage’s admiration are “<span>like visions seen with closed eyes</span>” (p. 179).</p>
        <p>Surely Balázs’s own prejudices weakened his theory. For both abstract films and fiction films succeed in transforming subject matter into significant shape, yet Balázs still praised narrative shape at the expense of plastic shape. Perhaps the lack of a clearly thought out notion of subject matter (raw material) hampered him, for isn’t it simple willfulness to permit avant-garde techniques only when they serve, and are tied down by, logically constructed and humanly interesting plots? Wasn’t Balázs making arguments analogous to those of early twentieth-century art critics who hoped to stem the tide of non-representational painting?</p>
        <p>Balázs would not be subject to attacks such as these had he mapped out in some detail the importance of the representational and, more specifically, of the “<span>human</span>” to the subject matter of film. Whereas the Russian Formalists accepted the consequences of their theory, admitting that the subject matter of art does not matter once it has been taken up by technique, Balázs held back. He was a formalist to the extent that he believed art results only from the conscious and consistent transformation of reality into art; he was humanist when he asked that the subject matter be humanly interesting; and he began to turn toward the realist view when he decried avant-garde techniques and modernist <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> forms which neglect or undermine the human world which, to his mind, only drama can reveal. But with these thoughts and criticisms we pass to the purpose of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> art.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no">CINEMATIC FUNCTIONS</h3>
        <p>Although I referred to Balázs’s book as an introductory text, we should not mistake his purpose. Balázs no doubt was content to instruct the uninitiated in the language and forms of film, but his primary and lifelong goal was the advancement of the art itself. Balázs, like Arnheim, had a profound regard for the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> of the late silent era. At that time the language-form seemed to confront proper subjects as a matter of course, producing stunning dramas of individuals in conflict with nature or culture. While Balázs was never so parochial as to assert that only this kind of dramatic <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> should be made, such films clearly form the core of the art in his estimation. They do so because they immediately perform the function of all great art by bringing us to an awareness of human meaning and human perception and by expanding that meaning and that perception.</p>
        <p>For Balázs every artform exists like a search light pointed in its own particular direction. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has thrown a light in a completely new direction, illuminating what was formerly enshrouded in ignorance or, more often, unconsciousness and disinterest. The belief which Balázs had in such “<span>directedness</span>” of artforms chiefly drove him to look for cinema’s proper form, for its proper direction. The power source generating the light of an artform is akin to its technique or particular creative potential, and the mechanism which aims the light can be regarded as its form.</p>
        <p>Cinema’s first responsibility is to grow and change until it reaches its proper strength and is able to function as well today as other artforms have functioned in the past. It must, moreover, find its own direction so that it can illuminate the spiritual darkness of our culture just as that darkness has been illuminated by the other arts. Balázs had no belief in the progression of the arts; <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> would never be able to do more than what other arts have always done. At best it will be like the frescoes of the Middle Ages or the drama of Elizabethan England.</p>
        <p>This does not mean that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> must emulate the other arts. It must emulate only their success in illuminating life and perception. But to do this <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> must employ means radically different from those any other art has yet developed. In one of his most striking sections Balázs chided the stodgy Old World culture for trying to make <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> perform in the manner of classic art (with discretion, distance, and cold objective form). Europe, for once, had to learn from America that the true form of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is one of spectator identification in which the distance between vision and the visible falls away. In <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as in no other art the spectator encounters not a self-sufficient artistic organism, but the world itself in the process of being formed by man.</p>
        <blockquote>Hollywood invented an art which disregards the principle of self-contained composition and not only does away with the distance between the spectator and the work but deliberately created the illusion in the spectator that he is in the middle of the action reproduced in the fictional space of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 50).</blockquote>
        <p>Here Balázs has marked out a privileged power for cinema, but he has done so at the expense of consistency. Spectator identification and delusion are seen here in a positive light whereas they work against the concepts of defamiliarization and of art as formal technique, which Balázs struggled to establish.<sup>16</sup> How can one experience the “<span>artfulness</span>” of a work if he is caught up in that work’s illusionary system? Put another way, who has ever been lost within the illusion of <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Tristram Shandy</em>, the novel Shklovsky called “<span>the most typical of all novels</span>”?</p>
        <p>This is by no means the only inconsistency to be found at the more general levels of his theory. Most disturbing of all are his direct flirtations with the very realism his theory denounces. At every level he hinted at the special ability <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has to bring us into accord with nature. For instance, it is the close-up, he said, which gives <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> this power of revealing the secret movements and the laws of nature.</p>
        <blockquote>The close-up can show us a quality in a gesture of a hand that we had never noticed before. … The close-up shows your shadow on the wall with which you have lived all your life and which you scarcely knew (<em class="notranslte" translate="no">Theory of the Film</em>, p. 55).</blockquote>
        <h3 class="notranslte" translate="no"><em class="notranslte" translate="no">A Day in the Country</em>, 1937. The realm of “<span>natural expression,</span>” gift of the close-up, vies with Balázs’s theory of “<span>expression through form</span>.” <em class="notranslte" translate="no">Blackhawk Films</em></h3>
        <p>Unquestionably Balázs is the poet of the close-up. Its power to him was infinitely moving, infinitely revealing. But this very lyricism before the close-up budged him inevitably away from the Formalists and toward the realistic positions of Siegfried Kracauer and André Bazin.</p>
        <p>Even when he left the subject of camera position and discussed dramaturgy, Balázs emphasized cinema’s affinity for “<span>nature</span>” and its powers of “<span>revelation</span>.” These are terms which recur endlessly in Kracauer. For Balázs the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> made nature the equal of man, for it both surrounds his dramas and plays an active role in them as well. While the filmmaker may manipulate these landscapes, there remain those films in which it seems as if “<span>the countryside were suddenly lifting its veil and showing its face</span>” (p. 97). There is nothing comparable to this tone in Arnheim or Eisenstein.</p>
        <p>Balázs’s penchant for, but theoretical denial of, the real and natural is what ratified his unshakeable love for what he termed <em class="notranslte" translate="no">micro-dramatics</em>. If the cinema’s chief power is in the close-up then its proper form must surely be the minute psychological drama which proceeds on the basis of details and which affects us by means of the intimate gestures of the faces of people and things. Balázs, like Bazin after him, compared the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">film</span> to a microscope capable of revealing the hidden world of both nature and the psyche. These close-ups cannot be called a language of gestures (though a throughly formative theorist would call them just that) but a “<span>radiating</span>” source of meaning. Balázs specifically attacked attempts to treat gestural meaning in digital or linguistic terms. Modern formative thinkers would here have discarded Balázs as mystical and unscientific.</p>
        <p>There are, finally, moments when Balázs contradicted his first principle that meaning and truth reside in man, not in nature. He said, for instance, “<span>The camera may stress hidden meanings present in the object</span>” (p. 114). From this it would appear that the filmmaker’s task is not to create meaning by using film’s technical arsenal on incoherent material but rather to explore and reveal the meaning inherent in objects in themselves.</p>
        <p>No doubt Balázs was fully capable of arguing himself out of this apparent contradiction, but the curious and profound tension in his thought between the formative and the photographic approaches should be apparent. His book was organized to argue a formative aesthetic and his arguments were not only among the first but also among the best of formative texts on cinema. Still, his preferences and predilections (for the close-up, for micro-physiognomy, for small psychological films, for audience identification)—all these seem born from a realistic impulse he tried hard to suppress. When forced, he admitted that his penchant for the small and the natural was a shying away from the “<span>whole truth,</span>” that reality sometimes interested him more than truth. The opposition which he tried hard to maintain between reality and truth was what finally landed him next to Eisenstein in the formative camp, despite his conservatism, despite the pull of the “<span>natural</span>” which is more evident in him than in any other formative theorist. While such tensions produce some obvious theoretical difficulties, they save Balázs from that impoverished reductionism which empties so many formative theories of interest and of value.</p>
