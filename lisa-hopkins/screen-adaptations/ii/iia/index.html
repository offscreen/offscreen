                        <h2 class="notranslate title" translate="no">Introduction – Setting The Scene</h2>
                        <p>The main focus of this book is on the three most celebrated screen adapations of The Tempest:<strong class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>(1956); Derek</strong> <strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Jarman’s 1979 film,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>; and Peter Greenaway’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Prospero’s</em></strong> <strong class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Books</em>(1991)</strong>. However, in order to contextualise these it is important first to set the scene by looking at the general history of screen adaptations of the play.</p>
                        <p>Although the first film version of The Tempest appears to date from 1905, it is now lost and little is known of it.1 The history of adaptation of The Tempest thus effectively begins in 1908, with Percy Stow’s 12-minute silent version of the play. This was made by the Clarendon Film Company (cast unknown), and released in 1999 as part of the BFI video<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Silent Shakespeare</em>. Perforce both silent and in black and white, the film focuses principally on the backstory. The first four scenes all cover events which occurred before the play starts, and much is omitted: in particular, neither Stephano nor Trinculo appears, so there is no treason plot against Prospero and also no comedy. The film assumes strong knowledge of the text, and indeed would hardly be comprehensible without it; in fact it bears something of the same relationship to Shakespeare’s play as a piece of music inspired by it might. It stresses principally the magic of the play – Ariel transforms herself (in this case) into a cat on camera – but does offer some other noteworthy features: John P. McCombe calls it a ‘transitional film’ between what Tom Gunning termed ‘the cinema of attraction’ and ‘the narrator system’,2 and both these aspects of the film are worth attention.</p>
                        <p>It is particularly striking that Caliban offers no provocation to Prospero before being caught – he is seen as fair game (a suggestion underlined by the fact that he is literally close to the earth, as if he were indeed a game bird or animal) and Prospero virtually stalks him (after having apparently taken quite some time to find him, judging by how much longer his beard is than when he landed). In the context of the period, this is immensely significant. Stow’s film was made in the same year that Baden-Powell’s Scouting for Boys, which included a section on ‘Men’s Tracks’, was published.3 In the wake of the publication of Edwin Ray Lankester’s Degeneration:<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Chapter in Darwinism</em> (1880), the alarming revelations about the physical unfitness of many of the troops conscripted for the Boer War, and above all the trial of Oscar Wilde, Baden-Powell aimed to redress what he saw as the degeneration of Englishmen by inculcating survival skills, particularly those of hunting and tracking. (There is a modern parallel in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Simpsons</em>, when Homer fears that Marge’s gay friend may turn Bart gay too; Mo advises him to take Bart hunting on the grounds that ‘After the boy bags a deer, all the diet Sodas in the world won’t turn him back’.) For the Victorians and the Edwardians, hunting was not merely recreation; it was simultaneously a form of ‘species policing’ and of asserting a radical difference between man and animals. In Stow’s film, the iconography of this first encounter between Prospero and Caliban would therefore have been clear: Prospero is fully human, and concomitantly fully superior; Caliban is, as he was for Malone in the 18th century, effectively an animal, and as such Prospero’s legiti mate prey. This idea will later be interestingly revisited in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>, where, as Simone Caroti points out, tracking and detection come to the fore again as ‘Footprints and energy signatures are examined’.4</p>
                        <p>Unlike<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>, though, Stow’s film is entirely confident in the polarities of the relationships it depicts: Caliban is bad, and Prospero is good, and there is not even the faintest possibility of any relationship between the two. So, far from there being any suggestion that Prospero might be to blame for his treatment of Caliban, and must learn to accept a form of kinship between them, Caliban simply disappears from the story. Prospero’s long white beard makes him look like a cross between a judge and Father Christmas; his hairstyle resembles a judge’s wig, implying good judgement, and suggestions of the godlike and of justice are reinforced by the absence of any hint of guilt or negligence attached to his exile – the caption tells us merely that ‘Prospero seeks refuge on an island’, and the closing caption which book-ends this – ‘Friends Once More’ – suggests that a simple quarrel had been the cause of his flight. Prospero’s status is also enhanced by the Christian purpose implied in the caption ‘To humble Prince Ferdinand, Prospero sets him to log shifting’, and by the fact that he raises his hands to heaven when he first sees Miranda and Ferdinand together. Moreover, the doves that Prospero produces before the storm could be seen as alluding to the story of Noah.</p>
                        <p>In keeping with the wisdom and benevolence posited for Prospero, Miranda here is virginal and innocent, as indicated by the fact that she is dressed entirely in white. Unlike the Miranda of the play, she is also allowed to see Ariel, who is presented in the film as an ageless young girl and thus a perfectly proper companion; indeed, in what we shall see is a recurring feature of film adaptations of the play, there is a bond implied between Ariel and Miranda – Ferdinand follows Ariel to find Miranda, and it is Ariel, not Prospero, who rescues her from Caliban. There is, however, no real sense of a threat from Caliban or anyone else, because all the villains are funny rather than menacing: not only are their gestures inevitably jerky, but they are comically swamped by their costumes (to a modern audience, Caliban looks strikingly like Robbie Coltrane’s Hagrid). Finally, the production is taken completely out of time when they all sail off in a longship with a dragon figurehead, an image which completely disables any possibility of relating the events to any contemporary issues.</p>
                        <p>Since this first surviving film, and a silent 1911 American film which is now lost but ‘was particularly commended for its exquisite storm effects’,5 there have been at least 15 filmed versions of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>. Notable adaptations include a 1939 black-and-white version directed by Dallas Bower and starring a young Peggy Ashcroft as Miranda and the horror actor Dennis Price as the ship’s master, and a 1989 Swedish-language cartoon version called Resan<em class="notranslate" translate="no">till Melonia</em>, directed by Per Åhlin and featuring in its cast a character called Captain Christmas Tree. As Judith Buchanan points out, there was also at least one version that went unmade: from 1969 to 1979 Michael Powell made intermittent attempts to film a version of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> which would have starred James Mason as Prospero and, at one stage, Mia Farrow as Ariel. This would have been virtually unique in finding Caliban more sympathetic than Prospero, and would have been explicitly set inside Prospero’s head.6</p>
                        <p>There are also shades of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> in at least one film which may at first glance seem a long way removed from the play. In a neat returning of the compliment of influence, Disney’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pocahontas</em> (directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg, in 1995) can be seen as echoing The Tempest. As soon as the ship sails we encounter a terrific storm in which a lot of nautical instructions are shouted, and Governor Ratcliffe echoes some of the key terms of Shakespeare’s play when he declares: ‘It won’t be long before we reach the New World, and remember what awaits us there – freedom, prosperity.’ This is the first of many uses in which the term ‘New World’ is increasingly ironised. Grandmother Willow speaking from a tree may recall Ariel locked in the cloven pine, and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pocahontas</em>, like Miranda, is a ‘native’ who returns the gaze. Most notably, the film seems to glance at<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> when it so summarily disposes of the lang uage barrier, since John Smith might well share Ferdinand’s surprise at hearing ‘My language!’ spoken by a woman in a fardistant land.</p>
                        <p>Like<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pocahontas</em>, several of the adaptations of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> have been marked by the degree of their divergence from the events of the play. Tony Howard identifies a Western version in Yellow Sky (directed by William A. Wellman, in 1949),7 in which an unnamed old man (James Barton) who is a ‘prospector’ is the Prospero figure, and his granddaughter ‘Mike’ (real name Constance Mae, played by Anne Baxter) is Miranda – although the way in which she tells the incomers to find water and is often seen performing domestic tasks also has echoes of Caliban, and the way in which her presence sets the men at odds with each other foreshadows<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em> rather than echoing The Tempest (moreover, gold is their secret, as the Krell laboratory is Morbius’s). There is, however, no Caliban nor Ariel, unless the Apaches can be seen as having a function in this respect: we are told by her grandfather that Mike has been raised by Apaches, though this is never confirmed and no explanation is offered of why it should be so, and they do at one point provide an apparent promise of rescue. However, it is true that the film opens in a storm, while the yellow sky of the title – a ghost town; the film was shot partly here and partly in Death Valley – could echo<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>’s yellow sands. Moreover, when ‘Stretch’ twice tells his men that he doesn’t like votes, and intends to wield power regardless of their opinion, the government theme of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> is evoked. On the whole, though, the differences between<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yellow Sky</em> and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> are more strongly marked than are the similarities.</p>
                        <p>Other adaptations, by contrast, have stayed stultifyingly close to the original text. Most notable in this latter respect – as was typical of the series as a whole – was the BBC Shakespeare version of the play, directed by John Gorrie in 1980. This had a wealth of acting talent, including Michael Hordern as Prospero, Warren Clarke as Caliban, Nigel Hawthorne as Stephano and Andrew Sachs as Trinculo, but was leaden and undistinguished and entirely devoid of invention, being, as Deborah Cartmell aptly terms it, ‘a simple, undemanding reading of the play’.8 The nearest we come to a display of the powers of television is when Ariel (David Dixon of Ford Prefect fame from<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>) jumps into the air and disappears; apart from that, there is no attempt to engage with the medium. No one ever looks at the camera until the epilogue, and there is some woefully unconvincing rain in the first scene. The production is very static, with all emphasis on the language. Ironically, the featureless rocks of the set and and the faintly sci-fi music make it all look a bit like<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>, though it entirely lacks<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>’s charm and verve; it is also set on quite an exceptionally large island, with much more of a suggestion of the planetscape than of insularity. This is a film which is strikingly conservative in its politics: Warren Clarke’s excessively hairy Caliban whines and curses, removing any possibility of sympathy for him, and the only noteworthy deviation from conventional pieties comes from apparent homoerotic sensibility in the display of the body of Ariel, naked except for a thong, and those of the other male sprites who are present in surprising profusion (at a particularly suggestive moment, a bent sword is positioned across Ariel’s crotch).</p>
                        <p>Among the more adventurous versions, Paul Mazursky’s 1982 film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> is very free with the narrative. Ironically, this was not what the director originally intended: as Anthony Miller notes, ‘Mazursky settled for an adaptation ... only after a prolonged attempt to plan a version that adhered to Shakespeare’s text’. In the event, ‘Mazursky’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> rewrites Shakespeare’s play as domestic drama and as a wry reconsideration of the America that is idealised in the writings on which Shakespeare drew for his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em>’.9 Among the many changes, Ariel, Antonio and Gonzalo all become female, and the island is definitively identified as Greek. Although Judith Buchanan notes that, ‘Despite being voted most popular film at the Toronto Film Festival on 21 September 1982, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> was not, in general, well reviewed’,10 Douglas Bruster, situating the film within the context of Mazursky’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">oeuvre</em> as a whole, and especially its habitual interest in infidelity, suggests that ‘<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> is arguably the first postmodern Shakespeare film, a prologue to, even an explanation of, the many Shakespeare adapt ations that followed’,11 especially when Phillip says ‘We’re learning how to live like human beings’ and Miranda replies ‘Humans go to the movies’. (There is also the fact that Mazursky and his wife have cameos.) Most recently, Paul Haspel, observing that Tempest is ‘a motion picture so central to Mazursky’s work that he titled his 1999 memoir<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Show Me the Magic</em>, argues that</p>
                        <p>
                            <blockquote>... both the virtues and the problems of Tempest stem from a discontinuity between William Shakespeare’s ambig uous, unstable tragicomedy on the one hand and Mazursky’s fun - dament ally comic and optimistic worldview on the other. Nonetheless, the film is important as a turning point for Mazursky; for in Tempest, he stopped restricting himself to American characters and situations and began exploring the interaction between American culture and other cultures of the world – a creative decision that ultimately led to some of his most accomplished and successful films.12

                        </blockquote>
                        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> takes many liberties with Shakespeare’s text. Far from opening with a storm, the credits roll over perfectly calm water; the first living being seen is a goat; and the first words spoken are ‘Son of a bitch’. Mazursky’s Prospero figure, Phillip Dimitrius (John Cassavetes), is Greek – not an obvious choice in a period when, 20 years before<em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</em> and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Captain Corelli’s</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mandolin</em>, mainstream cinema’s image of Greece was largely confined to<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zorba the Greek and Never on Sunday</em> (the latter is indeed mentioned in Mazursky’s film), especially since the Greek community in America is one of the less fully integrated, as was revealed in 1988 when Michael Dukakis stood for election as US President and was immediately portrayed as an outsider. What this unusual choice allows Mazursky to do is apply to the Old World/ New World dynamic the same sort of scrutiny as Shakespeare does in The Tempest, but the with the trajectory and polarities ironically reversed. Phillip is a famous New York architect in the throes of what he himself defines as a mid-life crisis: he imagines himself plunging off the top of the casino and then quits, declaring that ‘The money and the power don’t mean a thing’. This is hardly surprising, because all the usual New York neuroses are in evidence, along with valium, smoking, and excessive drinking; Miranda even spots Woody Allen, self-defined personification of urban neurosis, at the museum party. Phillip’s only wish is to escape from all of this: he takes his daughter Miranda with him only as an afterthought, and the Ferdinand figure, Freddy, is an entirely unintended con - sequence of events rather than being any part of the Prosperofigure’s plan. Here too Miranda and the Ariel figure, Aretha (Susan Sarandon), bond: Phillip asks ‘What’s with her?’ and Aretha says ‘It’s called puberty’; she can talk much more easily to Miranda than her father can.</p>
                        <p>Mazursky’s film has an openly psychologising approach: at an early stage, Phillip says ‘I had the dream again, and the dog had it too’; later, Antonia says of the island: ‘Very beautiful. Looks like a dream’. Aretha used to be married to a psychiatrist, and when Phillip says ‘The problem is I found a white hair on my chest’, Antonia answers ‘The problem is you need help’ – by which she clearly means therapy. In an apparent nod to the classic fodder of psychoanalysis, Phillip’s father appears (to my knowledge the only appearance of the Prospero-figure’s father in any version of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>), and the fact that Phillip is ‘consciously practising celibacy’ certainly invites a psychologising reading.</p>
                        <p>Less openly stated, but arguably more subtly developed, are the ethnic tensions hinted at by the film. Miranda may say ‘I’m an American’, but on the island or in its vicinity the ingredients of the melting pot separate into their original identities as both Phillip and Alonso revert to type and reveal previously unsuspected fluency in Greek and Italian respectively. In so doing, they gesture delicately but unmistakably at the history of tension between Greeks and Italians in the Greek islands during the second world war – especially since Alonso’s line of Italian is ‘Siamo tutti pirati’ (‘We are all pirates’) and he and his party are in one sense indeed invaders of Phillip’s Greek retreat. This is an interesting analogue to the Spanish/Italian tensions explored in the original play, where the Europeans are divided into two groups: the Milanese, represented by Prospero, Duke of Milan, his daughter Miranda and his brother Antonio; and the Neapolitans, comprising Alonso, King of Naples, his son Ferdi nand, his brother Sebastian, and various of his counsellors. Shake speare is very clear, and correct, about terming Milan a duchy and Naples a kingdom. Moreover, it is also notable that he draws a careful distinction in the nomenclature of the two groups: while Prospero and Antonio are clearly Italian in origin – Prospero shares a name with such historical figures as Prospero Adorno, Duke of Genoa, and Prospero Colonna, celebrated <em class="notranslate" translate="no">condottiere</em> – the names of the Neapolitan characters are pointedly not so. Alonso and Ferdinand are both obviously Spanish, while Sebastian, the name of the last king of Portugal, had equally strong connections with the Iberian peninsula. To represent the rulers of Naples as being Spanish in origin is not another example of Shakespeare’s cele brated geo graphical carelessness; unlike the notorious sea-coast of Bohemia in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Winter’s Tale</em>, it has a firm foundation in fact. Naples was part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which had for centuries been a bone of contention between would-be foreign conquerors. Coveted by the French, it had eventually fallen under the rule of Alfonso V of Aragon, after whose death it had broken loose from the Aragonese crown, which had passed to his brother John II, and had been seized by Alfonso’s bastard son Ferrante. It had however still retained its strongly Aragonese feel, with its rulers being very clearly identifiable as Spanish. For all its apparent distance from the original text, Mazursky’s Tempest can be seen as very close to it in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The 1992<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Animated Tales</em> version of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>, which was, like all in this series, an improbable collaboration of Russian animators, Welsh producers and predominantly English actors, is also notable for its treatment of race and ethnicity. Although the showcasing of the harpies sequence serves as a real advert for what animation can do at points in the narrative where conventional adaptations might struggle, the technique has corresponding drawbacks. Being puppets, the characters struggle with emotion – not least because there is, as Laurie Osborne observes, a deliberate foregrounding of their physical puppetness13 (though the film makes little use of the conceit that puppetness would so readily have allowed, which would have been to expose their existential puppetness too). Clear signals for emotion therefore have to be developed, and one of the ways in which this is done is through careful use of music. Very understated music over the opening narration is followed by storm sound effects. In general, music is used to supplement the language of appearance by acting like<em class="notranslate" translate="no">leitmotiven</em> for certain characters and themes, most notably Ariel and the Miranda/ Ferdinand romance (Caliban has none). It is also used to traditional filmic effect to heighten atmosphere and to point moments in the narrative. The music is generally modern in feel: at least some is synthesised, and there is an electric guitar at the end, in line with these productions’ general brief to appeal to a contemporary audience.</p>
                        <p>The primary language used, however, is that of appearance. Blinking signifies sincerity and/or contentment, and characterisation is expressed principally by looks. Miranda (voiced by Katy Behean) is blonde and not unlike Cinderella in the Disney movie; lilies are visible behind her as she sleeps. Ariel is a little like an alien with wings. Ethereally pale, with a suggestion of the skeletal, and semitransparent, with what looks like a tail, this Ariel is voiced by a woman, Ella Hood, and is defined almost entirely by appearance rather than action: Laurie Osborne comments that ‘the one figure who exceeds the puppeteering powers of Prospero has her lines cut so that she is even more under his control than those he overtly stops and starts’.14 Caliban (voiced by Alun Armstrong) has a Mohican haircut and a face that looks like a potato with a prognathous jaw, and is strongly reminiscent of Victorian anti-Irish caricatures of the O’Caliban. He has Vulcan-like ears and some kind of spines or ridges on his back, evoking an idea of the reptilian – perhaps specifically a dinosaur. Ferdinand, meanwhile, has a costume which colour-tones with Miranda’s, indicating their couple dom, while both Antonio and Sebastian have substantial paunches.</p>
                        <p>Particularly important are noses (this is significant, given that Stanislav Sokolov’s other contribution to the series,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Winter’s Tale</em>, does not distinguish characters by their noses). Antonio’s bulbous nose makes him look Jewish, while Stephano has a sot’s nose and Ariel’s is childlike. Prospero (voiced by Timothy West) has a nose which is strong but unsinister, denoting his power and establishing him as a physical (and, by implication, moral) norm. He also has a blue cloak, the colour associated with holiness in the iconography of religious paintings, and resistance to him is significantly muted: when he says ‘There’s more work’ and whispers to Ariel, Ariel says only ‘My lord, it shall be done’. Equally there is no ‘O my father, I have broke your hest to say so’, and when Ferdinand and Miranda avow their love we cut straight to Prospero blinking approvingly; he then pronounces a blessing with no hint of disapproval, so that the impression created is that everything that happens is the product of Prospero’s will. As we shall see, Jarman’s film is virtually alone among close adaptations of The Tempest in being able to entertain the idea of a Prospero whose authority is flawed and questionable.</p>
                        <p>In<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Animated Tales</em> version, there is certainly no sense of Caliban perhaps having a case, or of Prospero’s conduct to him being in any way unjustified. Considering how much is necessarily cut for the 25-minute running time of this production, quite a bit of Stephano and Trinculo is retained, making this version seem much more comic than<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> often does, and Caliban’s pleasure at attaining his ‘Freedom’ is undercut by the fact that he somersaults as he says it. The crucial line ‘This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine’ is spoken flatly and without emphasis (unsurprisingly, given Caliban’s marked degree of difference from Prospero), and although we are told by a voice-over as the ship sails that Prospero ‘Left behind that enchanted isle and its curious inhabitants’, we have no real sense of who or what these might be, because we have seen only Caliban. The voice-over also says that ‘His task fulfilled’, ‘Prospero, once again the rightful Duke of Milan, set sail to continue his fateful journey’; this evokes no specific location but acts as an emblem both of deferred closure and a metaphor of life, and clearly suggests that he is a figure guided by Providence. This is an idea further underlined by the fact that the production has a narrator (Martin Jarvis) – the device so beloved of 19th-century realist novels with providentialist overtones – who clearly controls how the characters are perceived: Prospero, for instance, is introduced as ‘The poor, betrayed, and overthrown Duke of Milan’. Most notably, the accusation that ‘The devil speaks in him’ is rebutted by a stern ‘No’ from Prospero, which clearly invites us to infer that the opposite is in fact true.</p>
                        <p>The idea of the Christian which hovers around Prospero is accentuated by this version’s marked downplaying of the classical elements of the play. The harpies – skeletal figures with grotesque breasts, presumably because the only thing to do with puppets is to exaggerate physical characteristics – are never named as such, and there is no masque, although a unicorn wanders on just after ‘Our revels now are ended’. Ferdinand’s Virgilian line ‘Most sure, the goddess’ is cut, leaving his first words as ‘Oh, if a virgin’, and so too is the accusation that the King has ‘loosed [his daughter] to an African’ – an omission which makes the play less open to accusations of racism but also removes the echoes of Virgil present in the original, where Claribel’s new home of Tunis is explicitly identified as Dido’s Carthage. The omission of the line ‘Most sure, the goddess’ also has other consequences: although one reference to possible goddesshood is retained, in Alonso’s ‘Is that the goddess that hath severed us?’, Ferdinand’s quick reply is ‘Sir, she is mortal’, and a Blakean-looking lightning cloud suggests divine intervention of an explicitly Christian rather than pagan kind. Moreover, the first line of Shakespeare spoken is ‘Hell is empty, and all the devils are here’, which, given the other suggestions of the numinous, takes on unusual theological force.</p>
                        <p>Ironically, considering the emphasis on ethnicity implied by the striking differences between noses, the actual setting of this adaptation is uncertain: we are told only that it is ‘Somewhere between Tunis and Naples’. There is certainly little emphasis on any specific context; although the big overhearing statue – one of many heads in the landscape – is reminiscent of an Easter Island head, the unicorn, the fawn, and the ostrich, while they may be seen as eco - nomically and emblematically representing an element of the text, clearly relate most closely to a generic idea of the pastoral. (The unicorn, an animal which will proverbially come only to a virgin, is also reminiscent of the tiger in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>, which turns on Alta when she has kissed the Captain.) The effect created is of a decon textualised setting in which racial character istics must be understood as innate and ‘natural’ rather than as the result of particular circum stances, while the resolutely Elizabethan costumes, like the Viking longship in Stow’s version, silently deny any suggestion that the events could have any resonance outside Shakespeare’s own time.</p>
                        <p>Even more interested in race, albeit with a very different emph - asis, is a 1998 PG-rated made-for-TV version of the play set in the Mississippi bayous during the Civil War, and directed by Jack Bender. Bender’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> is surprising in a number of ways. First, it alters the story of both the American Civil War and of The Tempest; there are some parallels here with a putative earlier version of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> – Wellman’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yellow Sky</em>. Also set in America, the opening caption of Wellman’s version declares us to be in ‘The West – 1867’; various characters are interrogated about which side they supported during the Civil War, and ‘Grandpa’ blames tthe war for the fact that ‘Stretch’ Dawson (Gregory Peck) has gone to the bad. As with<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>, the dialogue of Bender’s film intersects only minimally with the text of Shakespeare’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em>: not until the close do we hear a word of Shakespeare, when the hero, Gideon Prosper, throws his ring in the pond as a symbol of the renunciation of his power and says the ‘Now my charms are all o’erthrown’ lines from the Epilogue – the first (and only) lines from the play. Bender’s Tempest is entirely transposed to an American setting: it is set first on a financially troubled plantation which is, in the opening scenes at least, reminiscent of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gone With</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the Wind</em>, complete with a Southern belle named Sophie who is clearly a prospective second wife for Gideon. In fact, Sophie disappears from the narrative almost as soon as she has entered it, serving only to mark the difference (and the potential cause of a quarrel) between Gideon and his brother, Anthony. The only apparent link with the Tempest is that the ranch has ‘Prosperity’ written above it; over this we see ‘Est. 1783’, the year in which Britain recognised American independence. After the Prospero figure has been driven out from Prosperity, the setting then moves to an island in the bayou.</p>
                        <p>A number of other crucial elements of the play are also dislocated. Perhaps most notably, Azaleigh (Donzaleigh Abernathy) – the mambo priestess who teaches voodoo to ‘Houngan’ Gideon Prosper (Peter Fonda) – and, even more surprisingly, her son Ariel (Harold Perrineau), are both black. Traditional identities are complicated even further by the fact that Azaleigh is a good character, yet she is also structurally much more like Sycorax than any other character in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>, since Ariel in the play has no mother. Conversely, Caliban is a poor white named Gatorman (though the German subtitles – the only version of the film currently available is marketed solely in Germany, under the title<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Der Sturm</em> – call him ‘Caliban’);15 he does, however, fulfil the central Caliban rôle when he says ‘Before they came, this was my bayou’. The reasons for this reversal of the usual polarities are clear, even though not stated: it would be unthinkable to demonise African Americans in the way that is done to Caliban; instead, they must be treated with respect, not least because black soldiers have such a promi nent presence in the US army, whose history is celebrated here. (That this Ariel is an African American is loudly spelled out for us, when he is asked where he comes from and says ‘Africa. But I been working in Mississippi’.) Consequently Harold Perrineau, who had already played Mercutio in Baz Lurhmann’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">William Shakespeare</em>’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Romeo</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">+ Juliet</em>, is given the substantial and presigious part of Ariel – in which he is allowed to do far more, and display far greater independence and influence, than is usual – and black culture is validated in Azaleigh and her Mambo magic. One of the incidental consequences of this is that Prospero cannot drown his books because there are none – here, magic is strictly an oral tradition, as voodoo was for African American slaves. The extent of the reversal of the customary polarities is neatly indicated when Anthony hunts Ariel and shoots him – a structural inversion of what is done to Caliban in the Stow film, which reveals the enormous ideological shifts that have occurred in conceptions of race between 1908 and 1998, and between Edwardian England and late 20th-century America.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, two remaining taboos which Bender’s film is not prepared to tackle. Firstly, Caliban is not, as might perhaps have been expected, a Native American; instead John Pyper- Ferguson, who plays Caliban, is actually Australian, removing the problem of Caliban from the American sphere altogether (nor is there any indication that anyone other than white masters and black slaves may ever have lived in the US). Secondly, there is no Claribel figure, so no marriage to an ‘African’; in addition the friendship between Miranda and Ariel, though close, is painstakingly established as platonic. Miscegenation, it seems, is still the love that dare not speak its name, and perhaps this is one of the reasons why Caliban is white, since to make him so means avoiding not only the question of Native Americans but also even the faintest suggestion of sexual relations across the race divide. (Similarly, there is no mention of who Ariel’s father was, but the darkness of his skin leaves no doubt that he must have been black.)</p>
                        <p>The idea of mixed-race relationships would of course have been particularly abhorrent in the 19th-century South, and that setting pervades every element of the narrative. The Ferdinand character, Captain Frederick Allen (who seems to owe something to Leslie Nielsen’s Captain Adams in Forbidden Planet), is an old-fashioned southern gentleman, and we are forcibly reminded of the ideologi -cal implications of the American Civil War when Anthony (the Antonio character, played by John Glover) says to his brother, ‘Gideon, you’re sounding more like one of those Yankee abolitionists every day’ – while Ariel, who doesn’t want freedom, just to get to General Grant’s headquarters to help him, wants to go to fight for the Union because of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. It is here, rather than in any story of forgiveness or love, that we find the emotional heart and teleological energies of the narrative. Initially, when Ariel mentions General Grant’s headquarters, Gideon says ‘I’ve told you, there’s nothing there to interest us’. Later he repeats that he does not care about the war, but Ariel demands, ‘How you don’t care? That’s like saying you don’t care if your house is burning down’. At this point, the narrative voiceover from Gideon declares that ‘I did not see it then, but the truth of Ariel’s words was about to shatter our world’, and indeed Gideon’s house nearly does catch fire when he lets a magical flame land on the floor. Gideon repeatedly resists involvement in the war; even when Ariel shames him by asking him if he plans to ‘whup’ him like his brother did, he goes no further than giving Ariel permission to help General Grant if he wishes. Although Miranda, in the adaptation’s only glance at the classical, compares the war to that between the Greeks and the Trojans, bestowing on it the importance and resonance of legend (appropriately enough given the Christian name of General Ulysses Grant), Gideon still will not intervene until he asks Ariel ‘My brother says I’m isolated and selfish … Is that true?’, and Ariel replies, ‘Yes, sir’. Even though commitment to the war is clearly represented as a good thing, it is also apparent that this fighting has its price: when in Prosper’s service Ariel can become a bird; out of it he is free but can no longer fly.</p>
                        <p>Prosper’s final decision that he does care, and that he will intervene to help General Grant, provides the emotional climax of the film. He comes to help disguised as an American eagle, in one of the many human-to-bird transformations in the film; these may perhaps owe something to Ursula LeGuin’s similarly race-bending narrative<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Wizard of Earthsea</em>, where it is not revealed until the second book,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tombs of Atuan</em>, that the hero Ged, who transforms into a sparrowhawk, is dark-skinned and that the Kargish ‘barbarians’ are light-skinned. It is also Gideon who provides the film’s clarification of its own theme when he says ‘North and South. Brother killing brother’. Though it proves impossible for the two sides to be immediately reconciled – Gideon offers his hand but Anthony says ‘You’re a fool’ and is taken away to be tried by a military court – forgiveness and reconciliation are stressed elsewhere when Ariel intercedes for Gatorman on the grounds that he will be useful in helping them to pack, and when Prosper calls Miranda and Frederick’s marriage a ‘union’. Clearly Bender is attracted to the play because the brother metaphor maps so neatly onto his view of the Civil War – the South is in the wrong but Gideon recuperates it – and because Miranda’s marriage to Ferdinand offers so convenient a metaphor for bridging the gap.</p>
                        <p>This schematic approach does not, however, preclude a crafted attention to other concerns in the film. There is, for instance, frantic intercutting between Anthony at the ball, Ariel being whipped, and Gideon learning magic: Anthony is revealed to be callous, but Gideon, like Prospero, is careless not to know what is happening to the slaves on his plantation. This stress on the craft of the narrative is important, because the film is very committed to the importance and value of difficulty: magic is difficult to learn, and easy to lose – Ariel now regrets not having learned voodoo from his mother, and Gideon, unlike his original in the play, involuntarily loses the ability to do magic at one point when his faith falters. Not only does Gideon still have ‘much to learn’ about magic; he is also clearly stupid about Miranda, as Ariel plainly tells him: ‘Guess you some kind of Jehovah, gonna forbid her to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge’. Unlike his counterpart in the play, Gideon takes no visible interest in Miranda’s education, and it is not until scene vii (37 minutes into the film) that he tells Miranda about her past. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, she doesn’t take it well, because she is horrified that he has lied about it.) Nor has Gideon engineered a marriage for her; indeed, like Phillip in Mazursky’s Tempest, he has no prior knowledge of the Ferdinand character and definitely wants revenge, and when Ferdinand wants to get back to his regiment, saying that it is a holy war, Gideon – who is not testing him but genuinely trying to get rid of him – is minded to help him on his way.</p>
                        <p>In keeping with Gideon’s general lack of concern about Miranda’s developing sexuality, this adaptation has minimal interest in the psychoanalytic or even the psychological. So far from Miranda being kept in ignorance of Ariel’s existence, she and Ariel are seen<em class="notranslate" translate="no">tête-à-tête</em>; there can, therefore, be no suggestion that Ariel is in any sense an emanation of Prosper’s mind. Moreover, Gideon’s concern that the Ferdinand figure should be honourable seems much more reasonable here, in the context of a war and when ‘Ferdinand’ is a stranger whom he does not know at all and whom he did not lure to join them. (In deference to American values of merit rather than birth, there is never any suggestion that the Ferdinand character’s parentage is in any way special or significant.) The nearest we come to any sense that what happens inside the mind may be more important than reality is during the scene in which Gideon seems to recover his magic and to disguise himself as Miranda bathing and then sees Anthony, which later seems not really to have happened. Anthony thinks it was all a dream, and maybe it was, since Gideon subsequently says that he still hasn’t got his magic back. The only other hint at the psychological is when Anthony and the Gonzalo figure are caught between Gatorman and the disguised Ariel: as if the plot of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> is going wrong, there is a brief psychomachia before they choose Gatorman as their guide. This is, however, entirely logical, since Gatorman names Prosper and offers them the solid induce - ment of being able to track him down.</p>
                        <p>The workings of the mind are downplayed in Bender’s film because what really matters here are the workings of God. Above all else, this adaptation is pious, and the Christian God proves surprisingly able to coexist quite happily with Baron Samedi and the other supernatural figures on whom Gideon calls. (Again, there is a parallel here with<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yellow Sky</em>, where ‘Stretch’ Dawson swears on the Bible and eventually returns the money.) Ferdinand asks Miranda not whether she is a goddess, but ‘Are you an angel?’ – a question which not only abolishes the classical connotations of Shake - speare’s Tempest but also vigorously asserts a Christian one. Later, he buries an enemy soldier, puts a cross on the grave and saying ‘In the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost’, crossing himself. Perhaps the ranch should have been called ‘Providence’ rather than ‘Prosperity’, for that, ultimately, is the keynote of this film.</p>
                        <p>Many directors, then, have found<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> to be a play which speaks eloquently to a wide range of concerns. Few, though, have taken as many risks with it as Fred Wilcox, director of the first of this book’s three ‘case study’ adaptations,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forbidden Planet</em>.</p>
