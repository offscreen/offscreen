                        <h2><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>– A Brief Overview</p></h2>
                        <p>Few plays have been more frequently or more extensively adapted than<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>. It has spawned a host of novelisations, poems, and plays as well as inspiring essays and polemics. Very often the changes made have had the intention (or at least the effect) of pressing the text into the services of arguments for or against colonialism. As Susan Bennett points out, ‘Caliban in the last 150 years has been represented as an Australian aboriginal, an American Indian, a West Indian, an Indian, an African, a Boer, a “red republican”, a “missing link”, a “Hun”, and an Irishman’.34 Indeed, Caliban has effectively taken on a life of his own: Ruth Morse speaks of him as ‘a little like a planetary moon which has escaped its orbit to become a new centre’,35 and Nadia Lie and Theo D’haen observe,</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>In “Calibán,” an essay published in the early 1970s, the Cuban critic Roberto Fernández Retamar launched an appeal to consider literature and history not just from the point of view of Prospero, but also from that of Caliban ... The subsequent publication of two major studies wholly devoted to Caliban – Alden T. Vaughan and Virginia Mason Vaughan’s 1991<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shakespeare’s Caliban: A Cultural History</em>, and the 1992<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Caliban</em> volume in the Chelsea House<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Major Literary Characters</em> series – bears out the degree to which literary and cultural studies have taken these appeals seriously. In fact, a whole new discipline seems to have emerged: “Calibanology.”36
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Edmond Malone observed that Caliban’s costume in the 18th century, ‘which doubtless was originally prescribed by the poet himself and has been continued, I believe, since his time, is a large bear skin, or the skin of some other animal; and he is usually presented with long shaggy hair’.37 For Malone and the century which followed him, then, Caliban was little more than an animal, and this was a play that was always about Prospero; but for the 20th and 21st centuries, it has become as often as not about Caliban.</p>
                        <p>This emphasis on Caliban has in turn inflected dominant critical approaches to the play. Aimé<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Césaire’s Une Tempête</em>, Marina Warner’s Indigo, and numerous other reworkings have all constituted<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> as a key text for discussion of issues associated not only with the originary moment of colonialism, but also with what it was subsequently to become. As Jonathan Hart observes,</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Between 1957 and 1973, most African and large Carib bean colonies won their independence. Dissenting intel lectuals and writers from these regions decided to appropriate<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> as a means of supporting decolonization and creating an alternative literary tradition ... For 40 years or more – in Spanish, French and English – African and Carib bean writers and critics have, directly and indirectly, appro priated or discussed the appropriation of Shak espeare’s play. For instance, in 1969 Aimé Césaire’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Une Tempête: D’après “la Tempête” de Shakespeare</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">– Adaptation pour un théâtre nègre</em> was published in Paris ... in “Calypso for Caliban”, which is in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Highlife for Caliban</em>, Lemuel Johnson shows what Caliban has done with Prospero’s language, life and history: “papa prospero/jig me mama”.38
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Nor did the use of The Tempest stop there:</p>
                        <p>Sustained encounters with The Tempest are recorded in a host of imaginative and theoretical texts of the postwar decades of national emergence, beginning with Octave Mannoni’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychology of Colonization</em> (1950) and Frantz Fanon’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Black Skin, White</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Masks</em> (1952), and notably including George Lamming’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pleasures of Exile</em> (1960) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Water with Berries</em> (1971), Aimé Césaire’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Tempest</em> (1969), Roberto Fernández Retamar’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Caliban</em> (1971), and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Grain of Wheat</em> (1968), among other works, by the Kenyan Ngugi wa Thiong’o. In most of these works, con temporaneous British and American attempts to problem - atize the traditionally stereotyped critical estimate of the relationship of Prospero and Caliban are resisted in favor of</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>recuperating the starkness of the master/slave configu ration, thus making it appear to function as a foundational paradigm in the history of European colonial ism. In this process, writers like Ngugi, Lamming, and Césaire regenerate out of their own firsthand experi ence of colonization a conception of Shakespeare as a formative producer and purveyor of a paternalistic ideology that is basic to the material aims of Western imperialism.39
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>It is little wonder, then, that so much recent criticism has approached the play from this angle. In Peter Childs’<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Post-Colonial</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Theory and English Literature: A Reader</em>, for instance, there are four separate pieces on The Tempest (they are, respectively, extracts from Trevor R. Griffiths, ‘“This Island’s Mine”: Caliban and Colonialism’, Rob Nixon, ‘Caribbean and African Appropriations of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>’; Meredith Anne Skura, ‘Discourse and the Individual: The Case of Colonialism in The Tempest’; and Sylvia Wynter, ‘Beyond Miranda’s Meanings: Un/silencing the “Demonic Ground” of Caliban’s “Woman”’).</p>
                        <p>Despite the play’s interest in the past, it has often been adapted as or formed the basis for an allegory of the future, perhaps most notably in Aldous Huxley’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Brave New World</em> (first published in 1932), where genetic engineering triumphs in a world in which Shakespeare is outlawed, and in which John’s Savage plays an ironic Caliban to Lenina’s lustful Miranda. Particularly after Darwin, the play has also been increasingly understood as raising the issue of the relationship between humans and animals. Darwinian ideas had a profound impact on the understanding and staging of two Shake s peare plays in particular,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Othello</em> and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>. The Tempest had already figured prominently in the earlier history of literature asso ciated with scientific progress: Jane Blumberg suggests that when Mary Shelley was writing Frankenstein, in which an indebted ness to the theories of Darwin’s proto-evolutionist grand father Erasmus is explicitly acknowledged, her reading of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> at around the same time may have led her to conceive Victor Franken stein and the creature he makes partly in terms of Ariel and Caliban.40 Certainly the two texts were later to be virtually conflated in the many Victorian cartoons to depict the Irish as either O’Frankensteins or as Caliban figures.41 Indeed, Caliban became a versatile emblem for all sorts of alleged subhumanity, as in J. Compton Rickett’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Quickening of Caliban</em> (1893), in which a living ‘missing link’ is found; while the title of Daniel Wilson’s Caliban:<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Missing Link</em> (1897) states its thesis even more bluntly, before going on to argue that Shake speare, ‘in the Caliban of his “Tempest”, anticipates and satisfies the most startling problem of the 19th century’:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>It will need no apology to the appreciative student of Shakespeare that “the missing link” in the evolution of man should be sought for in the pages of him “whose aim was to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature;” nor, if it is to be recovered anywhere, will he wonder at its discovery there.42</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Wilson speculates that modern man himself may be to the man of the future as Caliban is to Prospero,43 and in H. G. Wells’<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Time</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Traveller</em> (1895) the eponymous hero wonders whether he may not himself be the Caliban to the Eloi Weena’s Ariel – an inversion of customary polarities that is echoed in Bram Stoker’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Lady of the</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shroud</em> (1909), where the Irish-born hero Rupert Sent Leger calls his degenerate English cousin ‘a modern Caliban’ who cannot compete against the fitter Balkan-born Men of the Blue Mountains.44 This evolutionary understanding of Caliban is, I shall be suggesting, a hidden presence in Percy Stow’s 1908 screen adaptation, and an interest in Darwin is also a pervasive concern throughout Greenaway’s oeuvre;45 indeed, John Orr comments on Greena way’s ‘desire to be a new Darwin, to adopt the Victorian genus of natural selection as his own double and as a metaphor of omni potent filmmaking’. 46 Most notably, when Alonso in Mazursky’s Tempest asks ‘Who’s Kalibanos?’, Phillip replies, ‘Your long-lost ancestor’, although Kalibanos is also termed ‘a fish in drag’ and there is a scene in which Miranda, watching TV, has Kalibanos on one side and a goat on the other; when he speaks, it bleats. In this wildly versatile play, then, Caliban has proved the most versatile character of all.</p>
                        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Issues for adaptation</strong></p>
                        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Setting</strong>. The Neapolitans in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> are on their way home to Naples from Tunis. They ought, therefore, to be in the Mediterranean. But the play’s main source was an account of a shipwreck in the North Atlantic; it has been much adapted in the Caribbean, Africa, and India; it makes extensive use of classical mythology; and recent critics have linked it increasingly to Ireland. The choice of where to set any adaptation of the play is therefore a particularly loaded one. Moreover, setting also influences questions of visual style, especially if Alden T. Vaughan and Virginia Mason Vaughan are right to think that ‘As one of Shakespeare’s most unrealistic plays,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> is not suited to Zeffirelli’s evocations of local color or Peter Brook’s harsh documentary style’.47 What then should Prospero’s island look like; and what, if anything, can or should a director do about the fact that different characters see it in different ways?</p>
                        <p>•<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Timeframe</strong>. To a Renaissance audience,<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</strong>, with its classicising masque and Virgilian allusions, would have appeared to be ostentatiously advertising its grounding in the classical past. More recently, however, it has been most often understood as an allegory of the future. Choice of period is therefore a crucial issue.</p>
                        <p>•<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Genre</strong>. Should the story be understood as comedy, tragedy, romance, or perhaps as science fiction?</p>
                        <p>•<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">How ‘brave’ is the ‘new world’</strong>? When the Europeans land on the island, each of them sees it differently; in turn, when Miranda and Prospero look at the Europeans, she is impressed while he is not. Since Aldous Huxley, it is almost impossible not to hear irony in the phrase ‘brave new world’. How then should film audiences be invited to judge the tone of the end of the narrative?</p>
                        <p>• What should a director do with<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">the masque</strong>, a form with which no modern audience will be familiar?</p>
                        <p>• Who or what are<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Caliban and Ariel</strong>?</p>
                        <p>• What should be done with Prospero’s long account to Miranda of the ‘<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">backstory</strong>’?</p>
                        <p>• Can film do better than the stage with the elements of<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">magic</strong> in the play?</p>
                        <p>•<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Music</strong> plays an important part in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>; Caliban says ‘The isle is full of noises’ (III.iii.135), and John P. Cutts declares that ‘the whole play is conceived as taking part on an island that resounds continually to music in the air, which is, I believe, equivalent to the music of the spheres’.48 Film has often found music particularly congenial to its purposes, for highlighting atmosphere and signalling narrative climaxes and also for indicating and developing character. What then is the rôle of music in a music-friendly medium’s adaptation of a music-rich play?</p>
                        <p>• Miranda’s name identifies her as a classic object of the gaze, but she also exercises the privilege of gazing. To what extent do the cameras of the various directors treated here dwell on <strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Miranda</strong>?</p>
                        <p>In the sections that follow, I will be looking at a variety of adaptations in the light of these and other questions.</p>
