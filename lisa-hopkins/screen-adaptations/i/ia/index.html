                        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Play in its Time</h2>
                        <p>The first recorded performance of The Tempest took place on 1 November 1611, in the presence of King James I, at court. As John G. Demaray points out, ‘The second and the only other documented performance of the play in Shakespeare’s lifetime was again before King James at Whitehall in 1613, in celebration of the marriage of the King’s daughter, Princess Elizabeth, to Frederick Elector ... Palatine, a Protestant prince noted for his occultist views and associations’.1 One can easily see why The Tempest was chosen for this occasion. Not only did the Elector, as Demaray notes, have an interest in magic himself – his later capital of Prague was famous as the principal centre for magic in Europe – but the play’s central focus on the marriage of a royal and beautiful young couple makes it obviously appropriate for the event.</p>
                        <p>However, although The Tempest fitted this event well, the immedi ate prompt for Shakespeare to write it – probably in late 1610 or early 1611 – was not the marriage of the princess but the wreck of the English ship the Sea Venture on the coast of Bermuda in 1609, while it was on its way to the fledgling Jamestown colony in Virginia. A number of verbal details in the play can be traced back to William Strachey’s pamphlet A True Reportory of the Wreck and Redemp tion of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, which gave an account of the wreck of the Sea Venture and the subsequent experiences of those on board during their time in Bermuda. This is clearly the source for the description of Ariel flaming on the masthead at I.ii.196-201:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>I boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak,</p>
                            <p>Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin</p>
                            <p>I flamed amazement. Sometime I’d divide</p>
                            <p>And burn in many places; on the topmast,</p>
                            <p>The yards and bowsprit would I flame distinctly,</p>
                            <p>Then meet and join.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Strachey had reported that</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>... on the Thursday night, Sir George Summers being upon the watch, had an apparition of a little round light, like a faint star, trembling, and streaming along with a sparkling blaze, half the height upon the mainmast, and shooting sometimes from shroud to shroud, tempting to settle as it were upon any of the four shrouds.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Strachey also seems to lie behind Caliban’s reference to ‘Water with berries in’t’ (I.ii.335), since he speaks of ‘the berries whereof our men, seething, straining, and letting stand some three or four days, made a kind of pleasant drink’.2</p>
                        <p>Shakespeare’s choice of source was an interesting one. Many modern analyses have related The Tempest to the history of colonialism, but less often mentioned is the fact that Strachey’s True Reportory was not in any sense a ‘standard’ take on the subject. In fact, it had been such bad propaganda for the Virginia Company that it had effectively been suppressed:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>... the Virginia Company was doing its best to discount unfavourable reports coming back from the New World and was carrying on a campaign of propaganda to convince the public that the Virginian enterprise was still potentially profitable. Strachey’s narrative was therefore too realistic in its picture of the unhappy conditions in the colony to make it publishable and it had to wait fifteen years until Purchas put it into print.3</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Although Strachey does pay lip-service to the idea of future travel to Virginia, exhorting would-be colonists to ‘let no rumor of the poverty of the country … waive any man’s fair purposes hitherward’,4 his editor points out that ‘His narration of the shortcomings of some of the group and of the mutinies that nearly ruined their prospects of escaping from the Bermudas were not matters that the Virginia Company of London would want to publish abroad’.5</p>
                        <p>In particular, Strachey plays the rhetorical game of apparently dismissing something while nevertheless bringing it forcefully to his readers’ attention, when he refers to a particularly unpleasant event that had occurred in the new colony – ‘the tragical history of the man eating of his dead wife in Virginia’.6 Although he says that this occurred because the husband disliked the wife, not because he was driven to desperation by a shortage of food in the colony, the damage is obviously done. Moreover, though Strachey tends to speak favourably of the numerous small islands that collectively make up Bermuda, he also observes that ‘they be so terrible to all that ever touched on them, and such tempests, thunders, and other fearful objects are seen and heard about them, that they be called commonly the Devil’s Islands’.7 Finally, Strachey draws attention to the work of a notable sceptic of the benefits and justification of colonisation when he refers to ‘those small worms which Acosta writeth of’.8 This refers to José de Acosta, whose 1590 Historia natural y moral de las Indias questioned Spain’s right to enslave and mistreat the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas.</p>
                        <p>There are, then, general issues of colonisation and exploration at stake in Strachey’s narrative as well as an account of a particular event, and The Tempest’s borrowings from Strachey mean that the play cries out to be read in the context of the growing push towards mapping and exploiting the New World. Indeed while, as Susan Bennett observes, ‘the textual body of Shakespeare’s plays has been a prevalent and enduring component of Western colonial practice’ in general, ‘No Western text has played a more visible role in the representation and reconstruction of the colonial body than Shakespeare’s The Tempest’.9</p>
                        <p>Colonisation was not simply a question of conquering new lands, and many of the other issues on which it touched are also relevant to The Tempest. One discourse significantly inflected by the experi ences of colonisation was that of sexuality and gender; indeed Elaine Showalter remarks that ‘[d]iscovered by an anatomist appro priately named Columbus in the sixteenth century, the Renaissance clitoris was the brave new world’.10 It has often been remarked that in texts discussing the colonial enterprise, the colonised land and the female body are frequently perceived as analogous,11 a parallelism which is neatly emblematised in the double use of the metaphor of ‘dis/covery’ both for voyages of exploration and for the exposure of the female body. In particular, in almost all Elizabethan and Jaco bean writing on Ireland, the closest of the colonies, images of monstrous femininity figured very prominently, and it is worth noting at this point that even though it is never mentioned in The Tempest, Ireland has been suggested by some recent critics as an important context for the play. Ireland itself was often represented as a woman, as in this description by Luke Gernon:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>This Nymph of Ireland is at all poynts like a yong wenche that hath the greene sicknes for want of occupying. She is very fayre of visage, and hath a smooth skinn of tender grasse ... Her breasts are round hillockes of milk-yeelding grasse, and that so fertile, that they conten[d] with the vallyes. And betwixt her leggs (for Ireland is full of havens), she hath an open harbor, but not much frequented ... It is nowe since she was drawne out of the wombe of rebellion about sixteen yeares, by’rlady nineteen, and yet she wants a husband, she is not embraced, she is not hedged and ditched, there is noo quicksett putt into her. 12</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>For Gernon, then, Ireland is a helpless maiden who can never be satisfied until the English enter and possess her.</p>
                        <p>Gernon’s image of Ireland as a nubile virgin desperate for sex draws on a common Renaissance trope, which compares land to be conquered to women to be married; the English were fond of labelling Spanish colonial activity as rape while simultaneously glorifying their own as ‘husbandry’, so that one Ulster poet praising James VI and I wrote that ‘Ireland [is] due to thee, thou are her spouse by all the signs’.13 As Lynda Boose comments,</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>although the equation between land and the female body which makes rape and imperialism homologous is a metaphor of masculine ownership that is neither peculiarly English nor new to England’s enclosure period, the collo cation of the two discursive fields clearly acquired new energy at precisely this historical moment of heightened land anxieties.14</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The link between women and land is particularly pertinent in The Tempest. Susan Bennett argues that</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Only when power is guaranteed is the colonizer prepared to evacuate the hitherto virgin territory (the island, his daughter’s body). Miranda, then, is as much a colonial territory as the island she has been brought up on, and her reproductive body ensures for her father the re-production of his own power back in Milan.15</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Although postcolonial readings of The Tempest have generally paid attention principally to Caliban, Miranda too is an important character to consider in this context.</p>
                        <p>For all her status as European princess, Miranda might in some respects also remind us of the native women on whom European travellers frequently commented. In particular, The Tempest has often been discussed in the the light of the story of Pocahontas, the young Native American girl who is famously supposed to have inter vened to save the life of Captain John Smith after he was threatened with execution by her father Chief Powhatan, and who later went on to marry another Englishman, John Rolfe, and to visit England a few years after Shakespeare wrote The Tempest. Pocahontas is men tioned several times by William Strachey, author of the account of the wreck of The Sea Venture, and in the light of the similarities between her story and that of Miranda, her father, and her suitor, it is not surprising that Peter Hulme, for instance, remarks that ‘The early history of the English colony of Virginia contains one story – perhaps its most famous – that has tantalizing parallels with The Tempest’.16</p>
                        <p>Both Miranda and Pocahontas show how, through her gender and her race, the woman is doubly the object of the appropriating colonial gaze – especially since her behaviour is often perceived as rendering her more remote from the norms of European femininity than the male native is from the male European.17 While the colonised male can often be regarded as effectively the mirror image of his new master,18 the female frequently appears to escape all available forms of classification and response, as witnessed in the following comments by the early Italian observer Amerigo Vespucci, after whom America was named, on native women:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>They are women of pleasing person, very well pro portioned, so that one does not see on their bodies any ill-formed feature or limb. And although they go about utterly naked, they are fleshy women, and that part of their privies which he has not seen them would think to see is invisible ... They showed themselves very desirous of copulating with us Christians.19</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Here the female body appears actually to be biologically dissimilar from familiar norms, and the male gaze – in Vespucci’s case, obviously quite a prolonged and intense one – finds itself ultimately resisted by its own inability to assimilate the visual information it receives to the pre-existing mental sets which determine how it sees.</p>
                        <p>At first glance, Shakespeare’s Miranda appears to pose no such problem to the enquiring male eye. Her very name – to which her father’s command so pointedly draws our attention – offers her up as an object to be effortlessly decoded: she is ‘miranda’, a Latin gerun dive roughly translatable as ‘she who must be admired’. To any educated male European that she might meet, her name would immediately label her in grammatical and semantic terms as passive, female, the object of the gaze. Her clearly demarcated status within both language and culture can, it seems, leave her nothing in common with the strange, non-European females whose inappropriate anatomy so determinedly resists the possessing male eye.</p>
                        <p>And yet Miranda, for all her position as princess of Milan and Prospero’s daughter, can nevertheless be read as occupying a position which, to some extent at least, overlaps with that of the colonised female native. Like female natives, she has only the most fragmentary and second-hand experience of European culture; she has never lived in civilised society, and indeed can remember almost nothing outside the environs of the island on which they live; she has almost no experience of white men or women; her upbringing and environment are clearly analogous to those of Caliban, who can stand, albeit rather problematically, as an emblem of the colonised indigenous population; and perhaps most obviously of all, she has been firmly inserted into language as the object of the male gaze.</p>
                        <p>Miranda’s situation is, in fact, extremely ambiguous. On one level she is that very rare phenomenon, a female coloniser – a fact which may strike us in the curious parallel between her own name and the name which King Ferdinand of Aragon is said to have proposed for that arch-coloniser, Christopher Columbus: ‘the king of Spain said that Columbus should be called not Almirante, the admiral, but Admirans, the one who wonders’.20 (The extent to which Miranda is implicated in the colonial enterprise – or more properly, the extent to which it has at various periods been acceptable to see her as such – is interestingly illustrated by the longrunning editorial controversy over whether she or Prospero should be given the lines in which the speaker claims to have taught Caliban language. The First Folio allots the lines to Miranda, but some editors have felt this to be inappropriate and have transferred them to Prospero instead.)21 As coloniser, Miranda functions as representative of her own culture, and yet her position within that culture is itself fraught with insecurity. Not only has she had no contact with any member of it other than her father Prospero, whose suitability to initiate her into it may perhaps be called into question, but she is, moreover, an oddity within the patriarchal society from which she originates, in that her status as only child of a duke is set to position her as that anomaly of Renaissance culture, a female ruler. The same tension is set up in those remarkable visual images of Elizabeth I, the Ditchley and Armada portraits, which show the queen simultaneously triumphing over but also sensually and analogously part of the sea and the land of her kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the future status promised to her by Prospero, while she is on the island Miranda is very far from exercising power. If her class position gives her authority over Caliban, her gender dramatically undercuts that power by making her frighteningly vulnerable to his attempted act of rape – a vulnerability that is even further under scored when Prospero imagines the same threat as present not only in savage but also in civilised males, and in no uncertain terms warns Ferdinand off any premature attempts to consummate the marriage. Miranda’s femaleness renders her, too, the subject of her father. The man who has lost his dukedom through neglect clearly has no intention of allowing history to repeat itself with his daughter: her attention is constantly enjoined; her wish not to see Caliban – ‘’Tis a villain, sir,/I do not love to look on’ (I.ii.310–11) – is ignored; her access to knowledge and even to consciousness is controlled by her father’s insistent shielding of Ariel’s presence from her and by his deployment of enchanted sleeps to keep information from her. Indeed, the extent to which her thought processes have effectively been colonised by Prospero is clearly illustrated by her confident declaration that ‘Good wombs have borne bad sons’ (I.ii.120); her pronouncement is made on an area in which she can have no knowledge, expressing an opinion moulded entirely by her father.22</p>
                        <p>Miranda is not, however, quite so passive a receptacle for Prospero’s educational processes as he might like to think. Like Caliban, whose own speech and thought processes still visibly underlie the veneer of civilisation which has been foisted upon him, Miranda still retains residual elements of a consciousness not moulded entirely to Prospero’s will. To her father’s confident assump tion that she will have no memory preceding their arrival upon the island, she ripostes that she does indeed have a recollection, which is, interestingly enough, of the company of other women – ‘Had I not/Four or five women once, that tended me?’ (I.ii.46–7) – and despite Prospero’s careful description of their mutual enemies, she refuses to demonise Ferdinand as one of those ‘Others’ whom Prospero’s language has so carefully constructed for her. In this she is, of course, proceeding in accordance with Prospero’s ultimate plan; but he – and we –may nevertheless still be surprised at how quickly, after 12 years of tête-à-tête, she shakes off his tutelage.</p>
                        <p>The admired Miranda has in fact gone through a precise volteface. Refusing to be constructed as a passive object of admiration, she impatiently dismisses Ferdinand’s praises and raptures and con cen trates, instead, on admiring him – and, in due course, his country men. It certainly seems significant that the remark for which Miranda has always been most famous is ‘O brave new world/That has such people in’t’ (V.i.183–4); here the admired one turns the tables, admir ing back; the classified, labelled female applies a label of her own, expropriating Adam’s privilege of naming all new kinds and simul ta n eously constructing man, not woman, as a new world, open for coloni sation. Prospero’s cynical response, ‘’Tis new to thee’ (V.i.184), misses a large part of the point: of course it is new to her, but that does not automatically mean she can’t provide an intelli gent response to it, for what she sees will be neither so unfamiliar as to dis able all categories of recognition, nor so hackneyed as to pre vent a fresh assessment. What we are offered here is a returning of the gaze; a reversal of the power structures habitually present in the colonising act of looking on as the passive, admired one exer cises the active function of admiration. It is, above all, in this charac ter is ti cally Shakes pearean ability to imagine a visual turning of the tables – to register not only how the ‘natives’ look to us, but also how we may look to them – that The Tempest negotiates much the same answer to the English colonial enterprise as does the Strachey source text.</p>
                        <p>Miranda’s admiring gaze serves also to reinforce the play’s insistence on the subjectivity of all forms of perception, as when the Neapolitan lords all see such very different islands in Act II, scene i:</p>
                        <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                                <p> The Shakespearean stage had few props and no scenery, and therefore inevitably depended heavily on characters’ verbal descriptions to inform the audience of where they were and what it looked like. It is very unusual for different characters to describe the same scene in different ways: perhaps the only other example is in the Dover Cliff scene of King Lear – and there, one character is blind and the other deliberately trying to deceive him about the nature of the landscape. The effect of this scene for Shakespeare’s original audience would, therefore, be particularly striking.</p>
                                <p>However the characters see the island, though, one thing is certain: everyone wants to rule it. This is an indication of another prominent concern in the play: its interest in ideas of Utopia. When Gonzalo says ‘Had I plantation of this isle, my lord’ (II.i.144), he introduces a major Renaissance theme, first explored in Sir Thomas More’s Utopia and ironically developed in the following exchange from The Tempest:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">GONZALO</strong></p>

                                <p> As David J. Baker points out, ‘The authority of kingship is in question from the opening scene of The Tempest’,23 where the Boatswain asks scornfully ‘What cares these roarers for the name of king?’ (I.i.16–17), and yet it seems impossible for ‘the good Gonzalo’ to imagine any other political system.</p>
                                <p>This may remind us that texts dealing with colonialism often constitute themselves as sites for the examination of the merits and demerits of various forms of government. This is certainly the case in many of the weighty theologico-legal tracts produced in support or condemnation of the Spanish kings’ right to the Indies: the Spanish writers las Casas, Mendieta, and Sepulveda all consider the Indians’ right to self-rule not only in isolation, but also as a test case of that fundamental Renaissance concept, Natural Law, which co-exists so problematically with civic and secular rule.24 A similar connection is made, too, in that most famous of all linkings of women and colonialism, John Donne’s ‘Elegy 19’, where the process of exploring a new country is seen principally in terms of the way in which it should be ruled:</p>

                                <p>In Donne as in The Tempest, and in many other colonial texts, the European system is examined only to be endorsed: the king is taken as the emblem of good government. In Donne’s poem, this cultural and social preference is glossed as natural by the implicit com parison to ‘normal’, ‘natural’ relationships between men and women. Similarly in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>, the idea of a ruling woman – such as Sycorax was, or such as both Claribel and Miranda briefly threatened to be – is raised only to be safely dismissed to the margins of the text. As Ania Loomba points out, ‘Prospero as colonialist consolidates power which is specifically white and male’.25 As we will see, this is also something which will be accepted as natural in many, though not quite all, screen adaptations of the play.</p>
