                        <p>Colonialism, Utopia and theories of government were all important Renaissance concerns and motifs, but time has brought with it other ways of reading the<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>.</p>
                        <p>Two or three years ago, when I was teaching the play to a group of final-year undergraduates, one of them said, ‘This is exactly like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fight Club</em>.’ I duly rented and watched<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fight Club</em> and concluded that it was not remotely like<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em>. When I told the student so, he explained that he had taken Ariel and Caliban to be not real characters, but rather emanations of Prospero’s psyche – as the Brad Pitt character in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fight Club</em> is of the narrator’s. This is a reading that the play would seem to go some way towards supporting. It is certainly possible to read Ariel and Caliban as functioning along the lines of the superego and the id, and it is notable that it is only Prospero who ever sees Ariel in his ‘normal’ guise. Equally, as Alden T. Vaughan and Virginia Mason Vaughan point out, Caliban ‘never appears on stage with either Ariel or Ferdinand. He presumably does not know of Ferdinand at all, and he may be oblivious to Ariel’s existence’;26 so too may Miranda, who never interacts with or shows any awareness of Ariel. This extreme isolation of characters from each other contributes to the impression of events as locked in individual characters’ heads rather than communally experienced, as too does the fact, already discussed, that individuals all view the island in such different ways. Indeed, Prospero seems openly to draw attention to the possibility of a psychologised reading of physical locations when he speaks of the human mind as if it were the shore of a sea:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Their understanding</p>
                            <p>Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</p>
                            <p>Will shortly fill the reasonable shore</p>
                            <p>That now lies foul and muddy.</p>
                            <p>(V.i. 79–82) </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Is the island of The Tempest, then, a real, material island or a metaphor for the psyche?</p>
                        <p>There are other approaches and questions which modern critics have found it useful to apply to The Tempest. One important consideration is genre. The Tempest is generally termed a ‘last play’ or ‘late romance’ – a uniquely Shakespearean genre comprising The Tempest, The Winter’s Tale, Cymbeline and Pericles, all of which focus on father/daughter relationships, sea voyages, and family losses and reunions. Certainly Miranda’s name – like those of the other heroines in Shakespeare’s last plays – is unusual in the marked extent to which it offers not only a label, but also a reading of its possessor. Imogen in Cymbeline should more properly be Innogen, ‘born from the deep’, and so shares her etymology with the sea-born Marina in Pericles; Perdita in The Winter’s Tale is, of course, lost. (Amongst the other heroines, only Hamlet’s Ophelia, whose name could ironically be transliterated to form the Greek for ‘help’, demonstrates a similar phenomenon.) This use of names gives the play an allegori cal feel, and indeed all the last plays feature strange, dreamlike events and an interest in magic and miracles, taking them a long way away from any kind of realist aesthetic and seeming to position them very firmly as romances, in the classic sense of fantastic narratives which often involve exotic voyages and miraculous or nearmiraculous events.</p>
                        <p>However, this is not the only genre to which The Tempest could be assigned. Dan DeWeese argues that the play ‘examines what life a pharmakos might expect to lead after being expelled from the city’.27 Pharmakos is the Greek word for a scapegoat, a sacrificial animal onto whose back the sins of the entire community are loaded and which suffers so that others need not. This would make the play a classic exploration of tragedy – a word supposed to derive originally from the Greek ‘tragoidia’, or ‘goatsong’ (presumed to refer in this context to the idea of the scapegoat). In Paul Mazursky’s 1982 film of The Tempest, Phillip Dimitrius, the Prospero figure (John Cassavetes), kills a goat for a feast, which might well seem to signal such an understanding of the narrative, especially since it is clear that his aggression against the goat is a reflection of that which he might otherwise have shown against those who have betrayed him. However, in the First Folio of Shakespeare’s plays The Tempest appeared among the comedies, and Russell Jackson’s discussion of Derek Jarman’s film of The Tempest is to be found in a chapter on ‘Shakespeare’s Comedies on Film’.28 The genre of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> is, it seems, territory almost as disputed as the play’s fictional island.</p>
                        <p>It also needs to be noted that The Tempest makes explicit reference to yet another, very specific, genre: the masque. Many of Shakespeare’s plays contain a play-within-the-play; The Tempest, uniquely, contains a masque-within-the-play. Masques are different from plays in that they are associated with a courtly rather than a popular audience – and indeed with courtly performers as well, since they were put on at court with the queen, Anne of Denmark, herself taking a leading rôle. When Prospero has Ariel and his fellow sprites ‘present’ Ceres, Iris and Juno, the contemporary audience would immediately have recognised this as a masque, in which the ‘real’ identities of the performers were intended to be clearly obvious (thus Ariel openly refers to the fact that he played Ceres [IV.i.167]).</p>
                        <p>As well as genre-based approaches to the play, other, very different interpretations are possible. In his Oxford edition of the play, Stephen Orgel includes in the introduction the following sections: ‘The Renaissance Political Context’, with subheadings on ‘Political Marriages’, ‘Utopia and the New World’, and ‘Authority’; ‘Epic and History’, with a subheading on ‘Italy and Carthage’; and ‘The Masque’, with a subheading on ‘The Masque as Image and Symbol’. The volume includes appendices on ‘The Seamanship of Act I, Scene I’, ‘The Strachey Letter’, ‘The Music’, ‘Florio’s Montaigne’, and ‘Medea’s Incantation’.29 In their edition for the Arden 3 series, Virginia Mason Vaughan and Alden T. Vaughan include in the introduction a section on ‘Context’, which includes subheadings on ‘Domestic Politics’, ‘Brave New World’, ‘Africa and Ireland’, ‘Literary Fore runners’, ‘Classical Models’, ‘The “Salvage Man”’, ‘Magic’ and ‘Masque’. There are also two appendices: the first is on ‘Sources’ and includes the Strachey Letter and Montaigne’s ‘Of the Caniballes’; the second is on ‘Appropriations’ and includes Browning’s ‘Caliban upon Setebos’, Rodó’s ‘Ariel’, and Mannoni on Prospero and Cali ban. In both these editions, it is clear that<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tempest</em> is a play which can be seen with equal ease as reaching both deep into the past (‘Epic and History’, ‘Italy and Carthage’) and far into the future (‘Africa and Ireland’, ‘Appropriations’).</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, unsurprising that one aspect of the play has proved to be of considerable interest to critics: its obsession with time, and the associated idea of place. As has often been observed by critics, The Tempest, Shakespeare’s last play, is one of only two of Shake speare’s plays to observe the Aristotelian unities of time, place, and action (the other is<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Comedy of Errors</em>, which was almost certainly his first); yet at the same time as it ostensibly obeys the unities, it also and at the same time subverts them. Although the action of the play covers only one day, the play insistently remembers the past, and in particular the classical past: the work of Margaret Tudeau-Clayton and others has shown the enormous importance of Virgil’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aeneid</em> to this play.30 The first words of Ferdinand to Miranda, ‘Most sure, the goddess’, echo those of Aeneas to the first female he meets in Africa, ‘O dea certe’, and we are explicitly told that ‘This Tunis, sir, was Carthage’ (II.i.84), the city where Aeneas met Dido. Moreover, Alden T. Vaughan and Virginia Mason Vaughan compare Caliban to Polyphemus, the Cyclops in another epic, the Odyssey.31 At the same time, however, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> has inspired several notable retellings set in a far-off future.</p>
                        <p>Equally, although the play is set all in one place, it proves to be a place that is impossible to identify with any certainty: not only is the whole point of a Utopia (literally ‘no place’ in Greek) that it has no identifiable geographical location, but the play itself insistently suggests both a location in the Caribbean and one in the Mediterranean. As Jerry Brotton points out,</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The presence of a more definable Mediterranean geog raphy which runs throughout the play, and which emanates outwards from the disputation over con temp orary Tunis and classical Carthage, suggests that<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> is much more of a politically and geographic ally bifurcated play in the negotiation between its Mediter ranean and Atlantic contexts than critics have recently been prepared to concede.32</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The much-commented-on reference to the ‘still-vexed Bermudas’ (I.ii.229) gives both an anchor point and, simultaneously and paradoxically, a place where the inhabitants of the island are not, since the Bermudas are somewhere to which Ariel will have to go. It has, moreover, been repeatedly suggested that the concerns of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> were in fact much closer to home: David J. Baker argues that<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tempest</em> is about ‘a dynamic relation between places on the globe that Shakespeare knew: America, England, and Ireland’.33 It is little wonder that adaptations of the play have chosen such diverse settings as the Mississippi bayous, a Greek island, and the fictional planet Altair IV.</p>
