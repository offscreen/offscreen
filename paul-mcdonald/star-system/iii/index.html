                <p>When tracing the foundations of the film star system, some histories of the cinema have frequently repeated a now familiar anecdote as the catalytic moment for the creation of the system (see, for example, Cook 1996: 40; Jacobs 1968: 86-7). The story goes something like this. In the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries. This policy was followed by the powerful companies of the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC) (i.e. Biograph, Edison, Essanay, Kalem, Kleine Optical, Lubin, Pathe Freres, Selig Polyscope, Star Rim and Vitagraph) and independent producers and distributors. In 1910, however, the independent producer Carl Laemmle directly confronted the power of the MPPC when he lured the leading Biograph actor Florence Lawrence to his company, the Independent Motion Picture (IMP) Corporation (later the Universal studio). Laemmle promoted Lawrence's arrival at IMP by naming her in an elaborate piece of newspaper publicity. On 12 March, Laemmle bought space in the trade paper <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Moving Picture World</em>to denounce a previous story supposedly run by a St Louis newspaper which had allegedly reported that Lawrence, previously known only as The Biograph Girl', was killed in a car accident. Proclaiming 'We nail a lie', the IMP announcement named Lawrence as the new 'IMP girl' and reassured readers of the actor's continued good health and her forthcoming appearance in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Broken Both,</em>to be released on 14 March.</p>
                <p>While the anecdote is appealing for its portrayal of Laemmle's entrepreneurial cheek and the courageous struggle it conjures up of a nascent independent fighting the mighty MPPC, it does not satisfactorily account for how the star system emerged in American cinema. Recent accounts of the film star system have seen cause to revise this conventional history. While film actors were not named in early cinema, there is evidence to show that producers were advertising the names of leading performers prior to the Lawrence incident. A further difficulty with the story is that it tends to imply that the star system was the invention of the early film industry. American theatre, however, had already formed its own star system during the nineteenth century, providing an example to the film industry of the value in promoting individual fame for the entertainment business.</p>
                <p>To examine these foundations further, this chapter looks at the impact of the star system on nineteenth-century American theatre before tracing the earliest actions by the film industry to name and promote its leading actors.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">American Theatre and the Coming of the Star System</em></p>
                <p>Before the War of American Independence (1775-1781), companies of British actors toured the colonies of the 'New World'. Professional theatre began in America during 1752 when the London manager William Hallam organised a group of ten actors led by his brother Lewis. The Hallam company took up residence in Williamsburg, Virginia, performing a repertory of plays by established English dramatists, including Shakespeare and Farquhar (see Harris 1994).</p>
                <p>Lacking the prestige of the legitimate English theatre, the colonial companies were unable to attract the best acting talent and certainly not the stars of the London stage (see Mordden 1981). Instead, Hallam employed his wife and other members of his family, and the company came to represent the stock system that continued to dominate American theatre until the late nineteenth century. Based on the recollections of family member Lewis Hallam Jr., the theatre historian William Dunlap described the Hallam company as 'a well organised republic, every member of which had his part assigned to him, both private and public, behind and before the curtain* (1832: 509). In the stock company, a group of actors would be employed for a season to specialise in playing characters cast by familiar Mines of business* or types of role, for example 'leading man/lady', 'heavy', 'soubrette* or 'old woman* (McArthur 1984: 5-7). Salaries would be scaled according to these lines of business. Built on the principle of ensemble playing, the stock company system did not privilege the appearance of individual star performers.</p>
                <p>While indigenous companies were in existence at the end of the eighteenth century, even after independence the English stage continued to dominate the theatre in North America. During the early nineteenth century, centres of theatre culture were established along the eastern seaboard. Following an increase of population and wealth in urban centres, major theatre houses were established in Philadelphia, New York and Charleston, and tours of America began to appear more attractive to leading actors from London. In 1810, the English tragedian George Frederick Cooke became the first star of the London stage to tour America. Cooke's visit started a trend which saw English stars touring theatres to appear for a few performances in leading roles supported by resident stock company actors (see Wilson 1966).</p>
                <p>Amongst the English stars to follow Cooke's example was the famous Shakespearean actor, Edmund Kean. After an unremarkable and often difficult career as a strolling player, Kean came to star prominence in London when in 1814 he took the role of Shylock in 'The Merchant of Venice* at Drury Lane. Kean's status was largely due to his style of acting, which became well known for its dynamic energy and violent emotionality. As the English critic William Hazlitt observed, 'Kean is all effort, all violence, all extreme passion; he is possessed with a fury, a demon that leaves him no repose, no time for thought or room for imagination* and Samuel Coleridge famously remarked, 'to see Kean was to read Shakespeare by flashes of lightning* (both quoted in Cole and Chinoy 1970: 327). Motivated by financial difficulties he was having in Britain at the time, Kean first visited America in 1820, appearing in New York, Philadelphia and Boston to perform a repertory of Shakespearean roles, including Hamlet, Othello and Richard III. For his appearances, Kean was paid Â£50 for each performance, plus a share of box-office profits (see Taubman 1967). Kean later returned in 1825 for a second tour.</p>
                <p>Cooke and Kean represented the influence of the English star system on the American theatre. For certain commentators, the dominance of the American theatre scene by the London stage was a cause for nationalistic outrage. For example, the American poet Walt Whitman declared that 'English managers, English actors, and English plays ... must be allowed to die away among us, as usurpers of our stage' (quoted in Taubman 1967: 83). American theatre began to find its first crop of indigenous theatre stars from the 1820s through to the 1850s. Notable names of the period were Edwin Forrest, Mary Ann Duff, Charlotte Cushman and Edwin Booth, among others.</p>
                <p>With the appearance of these early indigenous stars, some commentators were critical of what they saw as the influence of popular performers on American theatre. Writing in his autobiography, the theatre manager William B. Wood saw the advent of stars as a consequence of broader social changes, a symptom of nineteenth-century modernity brought about by 'a spirit of change - of exhilaration - of excitement, incident to an end of an old order of things, and the advent of some new and undefined ones' (Wood 1855: 544). Wood lamented the effect of stars on the American stage, believing 'regular actors no longer form ... a stock company, but [are] reduced to the condition of mere ministers or servants upon some principal performer, whose attractions it was now their sole and chief duty to increase, illustrate, or set off. Wood's observations were prophetic, forecasting the trend that would bring sweeping changes to the American theatre in the second half of the nineteenth century.</p>
                <p>While the American theatre saw its own native stars emerge during the nineteenth century, for most of the century the theatre remained dominated by the stock company system. During the 1870s however, the stock system began to decline. As a result of railroad building during the civil war, large-scale theatrical tours became easier and affordable (Harris 1994: 7). Combination companies, as they were known, were brought together for a single play instead of a season of plays. Where the stock actor was hired to perform a special line of business across a series of plays, actors in the combination system were employed to perform a specific role in a single play. To support the economics of the combination system, managers and booking agents assumed a new importance in the planning of major tours, and star names were marketed to sell tours around the national circuit.</p>
                <p>In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the decline in the stock company system and domination of the combination company was central to fully instituting a star system in American theatre. By the time of the arrival of cinema in the mid-i890S therefore, American theatre already offered a representative model of the economic and symbolic importance of stars in popular entertainment.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Edwin Forrest, the Bowery B'hoys and the Declaration of</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">American Stardom</em></p>
                <p>Edwin Forrest made his professional debut in 1820 at the age of fourteen, and developed a career based on his passionate portrayal of great tragic roles. Forrest enjoyed mass appeal with his native audience and has come to occupy a place in theatre history as the first home-grown American star. With his agile physique and sonorous voice, Forrest was well known for his energetic performance style. Like Kean, to whom Forrest played a supporting role during the English star's 1825 tour, Forrest's stardom depended on the dynamic and aggressive spectacle of his acting. Early in his career, Forrest became associated with the Bowery Theatre (opened in 1826), situated in one of the tougher areas of New York, where his vibrant acting style won him a loyal audience amongst the local 'Bowery B'hoys'.</p>
                <p>Although frequently likened to Kean, Forrest's acting assumed nationalistic significance as the mark of an American style and tradition. For Walt Whitman, reviewing Forrest's performance as 'The Gladiator' for an 1846 edition of the<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Brooklyn Eagle,</em>the star displayed a distinctive American style. While Whitman praised Forrest's performances, he saw the star's style eagerly imitated but rarely equalled by the many other actors of the day who chose to adopt a 'loud mouthed ranting style* (Whitman 1846: 546). Forrest's national significance was most pronounced during the 1849 tour by the English star, William Charles Macready. In contrast to the passion of Forrest, Macready worked with a far more restrained acting style.</p>
                <p>When Forrest performed in London during 1845, he received a hostile reception from British audiences, a response which the American star believed was maliciously cultivated by Macready. Disputes between Forrest and Macready escalated during the English actor's 1849 tour of America, culminating in scenes of public disorder. When Macready appeared as Macbeth at the Astor Place Theatre on 8 May, the Bowery B'hoys disrupted the performance with shouting, heckling and the throwing of chairs onto the stage. Returning to the Astor two days later, Macready was once again subjected to a hostile reception. As the house became more rowdy, the night turned into a full scale riot, ending when an infantry unit fired into the crowd, killing twenty-two people and injuring many others (Taubman 1967: 89-92). In retrospect, the Astor Place Riot appears as more than simply a conflict between two actors. Forrest was not just a star but an<em class="notranslate" translate="no">American</em>star. Forrest's stardom represented not only the popular appeal of a single performer but also a wider sense of American theatre struggling to break from a colonial past and produce its own cultural identity.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Early Film - Cinema without Stars</em></p>
                <p>While the star system was firmly established in the American theatre by the end of the nineteenth century, early cinema did not immediately emulate the theatre business. Film technology was developed in various contexts at the end of the century. In the United States, Thomas Edison and William Kennedy Laurie Dickson developed the Kinetoscope camera, which Edison patented in 1891, followed by the Kinetograph viewing machine. The Kinetograph allowed one person at a time to watch short films or Kinetophones. In Europe, machines were developed for the projection of large images to a public audience. In 1895, the French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumiere patented their Cinematographe, a combined camera, printer and projector. That same year the German brothers Max and Emile Skladanowsky patented the Bioskop projector, and in Britain, Robert W. Paul and partner Birt Acres built their own camera, which Paul accompanied with a commercial patent in 1896 for his projector, the Theatrograph.</p>
                <p>In this immediate phase of early cinema, business was driven by the economics of film hardware. The first film companies were the patent holders and manufacturers of camera and projection equipment. These manufacturers regarded the technological display of moving images in itself to be the prime appeal for audiences. The films themselves were of secondary concern and early cinema was marketed to audiences through the exciting possibilities of film technology. This trend marked a departure from the theatre, which was dominated by the production of narrative dramas. Tom Gunning (1986) regards early film-makers of the period 1895-1906 as developing what he calls a 'cinema of attractions'. Excited by the technological possibilities of projecting moving pictures, filmmakers created a cinema of attractions which explored the wide range of uses for film to record and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">show</em>something. Early films frequently worked to document a real-life moment and, in some cases, film-makers would manipulate the technology so as to transform reality. For example, the Lumieres'<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Demolition d'un Mur (Falling Wall)</em>(1895) documented the knocking down of a wall into a pile of rubble followed by the use of reverse printing to create the magical illusion of the wall returning to the former upright and intact state. This preoccupation was different to that of narrative cinema, in which film was explored as a medium specifically to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">represent a</em>fictional world. Early cinema was not without narrative fictions and the Lumieres would also make the two actor comedy short<em class="notranslate" translate="no">L'Arroseur</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arrose (The Gardener and the Bad Boy)</em>(1895).</p>
                <p>Early film-makers were therefore not concerned exclusively with making non-narrative films but the entertainment appeal of dramas or story films did not lead the business thinking of the industry at this time. By perceiving the value of the medium to be in the attraction of film technology, the early cinema business did not immediately look towards copying the practices of the theatre, including the star system. Reflecting on early film history, it could be argued that the first stars of cinema were the camera and the projector; however this would be erroneous, for it would be to miss the point that the early film business in the United States and Europe developed as a cinema without a need for stars.</p>
                <p>While acknowledging that cinema emerged as a medium of show rather than a medium of drama, it is important, however, not to lose sight of what was shown in early films. Although technology was the draw for audiences of the period, early films also immediately reveal the preoccupation amongst film-makers with recording the activities of human subjects. Working in Edison's studio, known as the 'Black Maria', Dickson created numerous shorts, including films with descriptive titles such as<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blacksmith Scene</em>(1893),<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Record of a Sneeze</em>(1894),<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Amateur</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gymnast</em>(1894) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Barbershop</em>(1894) (see Musser 1994). In the Lumiere brothers' famous<em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Sortie des Ouvriers de L'usine Lumiere</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory)</em>(1895), the static camera captures people in an everyday ritual. The attraction of early cinema therefore combined a fascination with the spectacle of technology and the spectacle of human action. It is this showing of people on screen which has made cinema from its earliest moment a performance medium if not exclusively a dramatic medium.</p>
                <p>The type of performance created by early cinema was not orientated towards the construction of star identities. Where film-makers did produce short narratives, the presentation of human subjects excluded elements essential to screen stardom. It was the convention of early narrative filmmaking to anchor the camera in a fixed position that set the action in a long shot at a distance from where it was difficult to recognise or individuate the actors. Without credits to identify the names of the actors or the characters they played, the performers of early narrative cinema were undistinguished and unknown.</p>
                <p>In some cases, short films were made of performers who already enjoyed a reputation in other fields of entertainment. Between 1896-1906, early cinema was organised around a period of itinerant exhibition, as projectionists travelled with their equipment and films to show as inserts in vaudeville programmes (Allen 1980). The interaction of cinema and vaudeville extended to the cast of performers who appeared in early films. In March 1894, Dickson filmed the Austrian strongman, Eugene Sandow. Other names from the vaudeville stage featured in Kinetograph shorts, including the Spanish dancer Carmencita, contortionist Madame Edna Bertoldi, facial contortionist George Layman, and boxing duo the Glenroy Brothers (Musser 1994). Running for less than a minute, these shorts showed extracts from longer stage acts. One Kinetograph subject, the vaudeville dancer Annabelle Moore, caused a scandal when she was rumoured to have danced naked at a New York stag party given by the showman P. T. Barnum. Although the incident was denied, copies of her film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Annabelle Dancing</em>increased in price from $10 to $40 (see Christie 1994).</p>
                <p>With dancers and contortionists as its subject matter, the look of early cinema was drawn to the attraction of seeing the movement and manipulation of the human body. For Gunning, the cinema of attractions was an<em class="notranslate" translate="no">exhibitionist</em>cinema, creating a spectacle that self-consciously acknowledged the presence of the audience, against the<em class="notranslate" translate="no">voyeuristic</em> cinema of narrative film in which the audience spy on a framed world that does not appear aware of the spectator. Dickson's films of vaudeville performers were representative of this exhibitionist tendency. Subjects were filmed in such a way that they performed direct to camera, reproducing the presentational address of the popular stage. With Sandow, the camera captured the strongman in medium long shot as he flexed and displayed his musculature to the camera. In early cinema, therefore, the performers who appeared on screen were professionals from outside the cinema, and the look of the camera demonstrated a greater preoccupation with the show of bodies over the representation of dramatic characters.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Emergence of the Film Actor</em></p>
                <p>While early film brought performers such as Sandow and Carmencita to the attention of film audiences, in the first years of the twentieth century the American cinema did not have a star system. For vaudeville performers, any degree of public recognition they enjoyed was for the work they did outside the cinema. Vaudeville acts did not perform regularly enough in film to construct any substantial cinematic fame. Also early producers or exhibitors did not seek to market films through the names of performers. Films were shot in such ways that actors could not be clearly identified and audiences had no means of knowing the individuals who appeared on screen. It was the predominant mode of early cinema therefore to present anonymous bodies on screen.</p>
                <p>Three factors appear central to the development of the star system in the American cinema. First, the industrial organisation of film-making based on systems of mass production in the United States and the move towards a specialised or detailed division of labour involved in this process. Secondly, growth in the production of narrative film and the formal changes in the organisation of on-screen space that resulted from this change. Finally, the beginnings of an active circulation of information about the identities of performers in films.</p>
                <p>In early cinema, small film companies comprised a handful of individuals creating product for the projection technicians who ran itinerant exhibition. As changes in the organisation of film distribution, exhibition and production saw the scale of business grow, then cinema became a fully fledged industry (see Balio 1985a). From 1903, film exchanges opened enabling cost effective distribution and a regular supply of new releases to exhibitors. Increased audience demand led to the boom from 1904-5 in the building of small nickelodeon storefront theatres. As thousands of small storefront theatres opened between 1907-1909, the American film business stepped up film-making activity, gradually moving towards an industrial model of mass production. The period 1907-1913 saw a shift in the geography of film production as companies moved towards the west coast of the United States to take advantage of the warmer climate and brighter shooting conditions. The concentration of production facilities in and around a single Los Angeles suburb has meant that since this time the American film industry is frequently referred to simply as Hollywood. It was in the context of this industrialisation of the American film business that the star system would eventually emerge.</p>
                <p>With an increase in the volume of film production, the American industry saw the transition from what Janet Staiger (1985b) sees as the organisation of production centred on the cameraman to a director-led system of production. At Edison, Dickson was representative of the cameraman system, taking overall responsibility not only to photograph a scene, but also to choose the subject matter, stage the performers, and then develop and edit the material. As early as 1904, companies began using directors to manage production and for Staiger the director system was prevalent by 1907. Several directors came to film after experience in the theatre, including D. W. Griffith who joined Biograph in 1907 as a film actor and story writer before becoming a director. With the director system, film-making began to move away from the social division of labour that the cameraman system was based on and towards a detailed division of labour, separating the conception and execution of production with the director managing a crew who individually took responsibility for separate crafts in film-making.</p>
                <p>This transition to a detailed division of labour in film production changed the status of the film actor. Before 1907, the performers in early film narratives where either non-professionals or actors who worked in the theatre but took occasional employment in the films (see Musser 1986). Production schedules were irregular and, with films hiring actors for single days, very few performers found regular employment in films. Eileen Bowser (1990) suggests that at this time film was seen to attract those actors from the lower ranks of the profession who were looking for work between engagements. Theatre continued to provide the main source of employment for actors, defining the legitimate working context of the performing professional. While producers feared that naming could give performers wider public recognition, leading to greater power in the negotiation of their contracts, the anonymity of film acting also served the interests of actors who did not want their name associated with the less prestigious work of appearing in films.</p>
                <p>From 1907, however, an increase in narrative production provided opportunities for actors to find regular work in films. Producers formed their own equivalent of the stock company system of nineteenth-century theatre, with Vitagraph and other companies hiring a pool of actors who were employed in various roles across a series of films. Paid by the day, leading actors received $10, rank and file players $5, and extras between $2 to $3 (see Balio 1985a). Benjamin McArthur (1984) suggests actors were drawn to working in films, attracted by the money, the widespread exposure and the permanence of their performance recorded on film. Furthermore, Bowser (1990) argues that the regular employment of the screen cowboy Gilbert M. 'Broncho Billy' Anderson and comedian Ben Turpin made these actors the first movie stars. Although actors of the legitimate theatre were hired to appear in films, in many cases the transition from stage to screen proved to be unsuccessful. Stage stars such as the musical-comedy performer Blanche Ring and comedian Eddie Foy Jr. found their work did not translate from live stage to silent screen (see McArthur 1984). The Triangle Studio closed as a result of hiring major stage names on high salaries for films which failed at the box office. Although film struggled against theatrical tradition for recognition of professional legitimacy, the growing film market provided a context in which actors could reasonably expect to work regularly and for comparatively good rates of pay. With industrialisation and the organisation of production through a detailed division of roles, the film actor emerged as a separate category of labour.</p>
                <p>It was not only the increased volume of film production that gave actors greater opportunities for work in film at this time but also the growing dominance of narrative production over other types of film and this increase in narrative film production is a second significant factor in the making of the star system in American cinema. Early cinema had taken the novelty of film technology as the basis for its business; however, the attractions of that technology were limited. To maintain demand, the film business saw a shift from prioritising the economics of film hardware towards the concern with driving the market through producing new and attractive films. Before 1903, various types of film appeared in vaudeville programmes. Audiences were offered a wide variety of films, including not only the recordings of vaudeville acts discussed earlier, but also trick films (exploiting the manipulative effects of camera technology), various forms of documentary, comedies and short dramas.</p>
                <p>Of the films made in 1904, Robert Allen (1980) sees films with documentary subject matter accounting for forty-two per cent of the total films produced. Comedies comprised forty-five per cent of films, with dramatic narratives accounting for eight per cent and trick films five per cent. Between 1907-1908, a significant change occurred as production of narrative forms in the shape of comedies and dramas swiftly overwhelmed documentary forms. In 1907, production was divided between sixty-seven per cent comedies and dramas, against thirty-three per cent documentaries. By 1908, the imbalance in output had increased to ninety-six per cent narrative forms and only four per cent documentary forms.</p>
                <p>There is no clear evidence to suggest why this change should have happened. Allen suggests that the growth in nickelodeon building created an increased demand for new films that required producers to rethink their production practices. Documentary forms required shooting on location, which was not only costly but also placed crews in environments where happenings did not occur under the total control of the crew and so could not be planned or predicted. Narrative production, either in the form of comedies or dramas, could be planned, contained and organised in the controlled environment of the studio, with material generated specifically for that purpose. Allen therefore speculates that the increased volume of narrative film-making came from the need to regularise production in order to supply exhibitors: narrative allowed film-makers and distributors to efficiently control supply to meet demand. While this argument may be a point for further research in film history, it is the effect and not the cause which is important for the star system. Relying on the skilled performer, the increased output of comedies and dramas expanded the labour market for professional actors to work regularly in film.</p>
                <p>As film in the United States moved from a cinema of attractions to a narrative cinema, film-makers explored the possibilities of film form in telling stories. Early narrative film-making tended to photograph an entire scene in a single shot, with the camera set at sufficient distance from the action so as to capture the whole body of a performer in long shot. This manner of filming made the frame equivalent to the proscenium arch in the theatre. Like stage actors, a film actor had to be conscious of how he or she placed the body in performance. Film performers were required to keep their bodies at angles that were constantly open to the look of the imaginary audience represented by the fixed camera. Early narrative film therefore displayed a frontal style of performance, limiting the performance possibilities of actors. Filming actors in long shot, these tableaux scenes not only demanded a highly gestural and demonstrative style of acting but also set members of the audience at a distance that prevented the intimate identification necessary for stars to become a recognisable feature of film narrative.</p>
                <p>Janet Staiger (1985a) sees the American film industry undergoing a number of changes in the development in narrative film production between 1908-1912. During this period the industry moved more towards character-centred narratives with dialogue intertitles. In a change to film style, the camera was moved closer to the action, cutting actors off at the knees and, on occasions, framing the actor from head to waist in medium shot. As the conventions of continuity editing were elaborated, so an increased use of close-ups, patterns of shot/reverse shot cutting, and eyeline matching, were all used to bring further emphasis to the actor's face as a source of meaning. Changes in staging methods therefore established a complex performance space on screen in which the camera shifted its relationship to the bodies of performers.</p>
                <p>With this new performance space came a more physically reserved style of acting. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, American theatre had already seen many actors moving away from the declamatory style of acting associated with melodrama, preferring a more restrained style of playing which was seen to introduce a new standard of realism in acting. Roberta Pearson (1992) identifies a similar shift occurring in American film in the period after narrative film forms began to dominate production. The effects of this transition became most evident in the years 1910-1911. As the use of camera more closely explored the details of the actor's performance, so actors drew on small gestures and facial expressions. This combination of film form and performance style constructed a greater sense of interiority in performance. In the trade papers of the period, commentators viewed this change as bringing psychological complexity to film acting.</p>
                <p>Pearson argues this transition played an important part in raising the cultural status of cinema in America. The new acting style was not simply a product of the change in film form but an imitation of the stylistic practices found in the legitimate theatre, signifying a sense of 'quality'. Performance style therefore played a role in distinguishing narrative film from the cinema's roots in vaudeville exhibition. As Pearson comments, 'the shift in performance style can ... be seen as part of cinema's transition from the cheap amusement of the "lower orders" to mainstream medium appealing to patrons of all classes' (1992: 139).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Discourses of Stardom</em></p>
                <p>While the industrialisation of film production created a detailed division of labour, providing regular employment for actors, and the dominance of narrative production elaborated methods of staging that provided audiences with a more intimate image of performers, these were only necessary but not sufficient conditions for the production of star identities. Audiences could see performers but they had no means of knowing<em class="notranslate" translate="no">who</em>they watched. A final factor in the making of the film star system therefore came with the circulation of information that identified and promoted the images of individual performers. For Richard de Cordova (1990), the emergence of the star system in American cinema came after 1907 with the distribution of certain types of knowledge or 'discourse' about film performers. As film acting became a stable profession, during 1907 the trade press began to publish articles examining the work of the film actor. De Cordova sees the appearance of such articles as marking an important early stage in the emergence of the star system. By making known the work of film acting, these early articles raised public awareness of the human labour involved in the production of on-screen performances, resulting in what he has referred to as the 'discourse on acting'. In line with the transition to a detailed division of labour, in which actors became a specialised category of worker, the discursive construction of the 'film actor' as a category of artistic professional was introduced to the movie-going public. The effect of this discourse was that while individual actors remained unknown, something of the work of acting was revealed.</p>
                <p>As cinema matured as an entertainment business in America, members of the MPPC and independent producers marketed their films through brand names. For example, films were sold as Biographs or Vitagraphs. Brand names worked by selling a film through its sameness to other films, offering audiences a reassuring indicator of quality which, as Bowser argues, guaranteed 'uniformity of the product manufactured' (1990: 103). Branding identified one body of films as the work of a particular studio while also differentiating those films from the products of other studios. A brand name was therefore a sign of similarity and difference.</p>
                <p>Although branding as a marketing strategy directed the consuming interests of audiences towards the production company and not the performers, when the companies did begin to publish the names of their players, those names functioned in the same way to signify similarity and difference. Early cases of naming occurred before the infamous Laemmle/ Lawrence incident. When Vitagraph, a member of the MPPC, released its production of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oliver Twist</em>in May 1909, the film carried an on-screen credit announcing 'Miss Elita Proctor Otis as "Nancy Sykes"' at the point where the actor first appeared in the film. At the same time, the<em class="notranslate" translate="no">New York</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dramatic Mirror</em>named Otis and promoted her appearance as Nancy Sykes. Naming personalities worked in conjunction with the new performance space of narrative film to individuate performers. Audiences could begin not only to recognise performers but also have a name to put to the face. As that face and name appeared across films, so an on-screen identity was pieced together.</p>
                <p>Further instances of naming soon followed. Edison ran articles on performers in the company's own<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kinetogram</em>periodical. In particular, the French pantomime artist Pilar-Morin was promoted across a number of films, with the effect that her name became the means for the identification of a specific on-screen identity. It is this use of the name to construct knowledge of performers across a series of film appearances that de Cordova sees as central to advancing the promotion of the 'picture personality'. Where the discourse on acting constructed a supra-individual knowledge of film performance as a craft practised by many, the picture personality introduced a specifically individual knowledge of the single performer.</p>
                <p>Naming sectioned off certain performers as worthy of special attention and American cinema began to systematically promote individual actors as a means of marketing films. In particular, Kalem, Edison, and the French company Pathe, all actively announced the names of actors in their films. To promote personalities, production companies introduced new methods for raising awareness of leading names. Alongside newspaper articles and advertisements, the names of actors appeared on lobby cards made by producers for exhibitors to display in theatres, together with slides of favourite actors to be shown between films (see Staiger 1983). Performers made personal appearances and fan magazines were published. By May 1911, the Edison company had started to provide onscreen credits for its actors. Within two years after the first naming of film actors, cinema had discovered many of the basic promotional tools still used to sell stars today.</p>
                <p>For de Cordova, the name of the performer was central to the intertextuality of the picture personality's image. At one level, the name functioned to construct the picture personality as an on-screen identity, linking performances in separate films: 'Personality existed as an effect of ... the representation of character across a number of films' (1990: 86). The effect of the name extended beyond the screen, however, into stories carried by the press and fan magazines, yet de Cordova sees this extrafilmic discourse limited to discussion of the on-screen work and roles of personalities. For this reason, knowledge of personalities remained anchored in the performer's on-screen life, with the identities of personalities defined in terms of 'a professional existence - a history of appearances in films and plays and a personality gleaned from those appearances' (p. 92).</p>
                <p>While the personality discourse was an important stage in the emergence of the star system, for de Cordova the system itself was only fully realised after 1913 when stories circulated in the press about the offscreen lives of popular film performers. This new realm of knowledge introduced readers to life behind the screen, so that the star was known not only through his or her roles but also as 'a character in a narrative quite separable from his or her work in any film' (p. 99). By combining knowledge of on-screen and off-screen lives, star discourse constructed both a professional and private existence for performers. In the star discourse, de Cordova identifies a central concern with distinguishing the moral healthiness of work in cinema against life in theatre. Compared to the night-time work, travelling and general insecurities of the theatre, working in films was represented as offering regular daytime conditions conducive to maintaining stable domestic and familial lives.</p>
                <p>Another set of concerns with the private existence of film performers came through reporting the wealthy lifestyles enjoyed by stars. With big homes and expensive cars, the lifestyle of stars exemplified the values of the consumer economy. Stardom and consumerism both share an element of fantasy and desire. Consumerism is escapist, promoting the fantasy of living beyond basic necessities. The market suggests consumers are free to choose what they want rather than what they need. Through the exercise of choice, consumption takes on the appearance of an act of individual self-expression. Advertising becomes a vital component of the consumer economy, using the image of things to stimulate desire. Images of wealth, freedom and individualism are therefore fundamental to consumerism and since the start of the star system, popular film performers have played a significant role in promoting those values.</p>
                <p>With many stars known to have come from humble backgrounds, the glorification of consumption in the coverage of star lifestyles presented the trappings of stardom as material pleasures which could be legitimately aspired to and possibly achieved by one and all. As Lary May observes in his discussion of press reporting on the lifestyles of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, 'they demonstrated how modern consumption allowed one to emulate the styles of the high and mighty* (1980: 145-6).</p>
                <p>By representing the moral rectitude of performers' lives, star discourse promoted the image of the whole cinema business. Through controlling what became known about a star's private existence, production companies could actively manage the image of the industry, protecting it against those critics who were eager to dismiss cinema as morally degraded and in need of censorial intervention. With many early stars playing on-screen roles as virtuous heroes and heroines whose moral course withstood whatever challenges were put in its way, the representation of a wholesome off-screen existence achieved moral closure between the star's on-screen and off-screen images. During the early 1920s however, newspaper stories began to appear which disrupted that closure. Between 1920-1921, several stories broke about the divorces of stars such as Conway Tearle, Clara Kimbell Young, Francis X. Bushman and Douglas Fairbanks (see de Cordova 1990). Initially, these stories received little attention by the press. From late-1921, however, a series of high profile scandals made headlines and had a profound effect on star discourse. Most notable was the case of popular comedian Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, who was accused but later acquitted of murdering the film actor Virginia Rappe in his hotel room. For de Cordova, the star scandal added a further level of knowledge to star discourse: 'Exposes on the real lives of the stars would no longer be limited to stories of success, security, and marital bliss; transgression, betrayal, restlessness, and loss entered into the dramatic formula' (1990: 121).</p>
                <p>For the early star system, the effect of reporting scandal therefore drew attention to the contradictions that could exist in the images and lives of stars. Through the circulation of the discourses of stardom, audiences came to know who they watched on screen. With the construction of the picture personality, the performer became a vital means of branding and differentiating the film product. Covering the lifestyles of performers, star discourse picked out certain film actors as worthy of identification and desire. In contradiction to what appeared in films and sanctioned accounts of the star's lifestyle, star scandal made known what appeared to be the most intimate truths of a star's identity. Whether true or not, scandal stories were nevertheless important to an audience's understanding of the star as not only an object of desire but also a desiring subject.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Mary Pickford - from 'the Girl with the Curls' to United Artists</em></p>
                <p>Mary Pickford holds a significant place in the early history of film stardom. Not only was she one of the most popular stars of the silent era but through her own actions, she effectively exploited her image and in so doing revealed the early value placed by the American film industry on the star as capital. Born in Toronto, real name Gladys Mary Smith, Pickford was still a child when she entered the theatre by joining a local stock company. Her theatrical career continued into her early teens, touring and working for David Belasco in New York, until in 1909 she left the theatre to become a film actor at Biograph under the direction of D. W. Griffith.</p>
                <p>It was during her years at Biograph that Pickford achieved her star status. Like all actors of the time, Pickford's appearances for Biograph were uncredited. Pickford can, however, be seen as one of the first players to be lifted out of anonymity by the discourse of the picture personality. In her first big hit for Biograph, Griffith's<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Little Teacher</em> (1909), intensities identified Pickford as 'Little Mary', a label that would stick for much of her early film career. Other sources referred to her as 'Goldilocks', 'The Girl with the Curls' and, after Florence Lawrence left for IMP, 'The Biograph Girl'. As Molly Haskell suggests, Pickford's image was similar to that of Griffith's other major female star of the period, Lillian Gish, a type who represented 'the diminutive child-woman' (1987: 58). Pickford's image contrasted sharply with that of other female contemporaries, such as the vampish Theda Bara and the sophisticated Louise Brooks.</p>
                <p>Although Pickford's image signified fragility and innocence, the star showed herself to be a shrewd businesswoman, and she was quick to take control of her career. Naming made Pickford into a marketable personality and the value of the star's image was not only recognised and exploited by the studios but also by the star herself. Leaving Biograph to join IMP in December 1910, Pickford successfully negotiated a salary rise to $175 dollars a week. There followed a series of rapid career moves, with a four picture contract the following year at Majestic for $275 a week, and in 1912 a lucrative new contract with Biograph (see Balio 1976).</p>
                <p>During a brief return to the Broadway stage in 1913, Pickford was spotted by Adolph Zukor who asked her to join his Famous Players Company. While working for Zukor, Pickford's salary would rise dramatically. Initially signing for $500 a week, Pickford used her name to negotiate ever higher salaries, rising quickly to $1,000 and then $2,000 a week. When the American Film Company offered Pickford $4,000 a week for the serial<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Diamond in the Sky,</em>Zukor was forced to meet the price to hold on to the star. Such was the value of the Pickford name that Mary's sister Lotte was employed for the series instead. To keep Pickford, Zukor agreed in 1916 to the formation of the star's own production company, The Mary Pickford Corporation, with Pickford owning a 50% interest, taking half the profits of all films and earning $10,000 a week, a guaranteed salary of at least $1 million over two years.</p>
                <p>Pickford was able to exercise leverage in salary negotiations for it was known that Paramount, the distributor of films from Famous Players, used the Pickford name to sell packages of films to exhibitors through the practice of block booking (that is, organising sales of fixed packages of film titles that mixed average or poor product with star titles). As Zukor raised Pickford's salary, he passed the cost on to the exhibitor, increasing the guarantee fee from $35,000 to $65,000 and then $120,000. When Pickford's salary went up to $10,000 a week, the guarantee fee reached $165,000 (Pickford 1956). After her contract expired in 1918, First National poached Pickford with an offer of $675,000 for three films, with fifty per cent of profits along with authority to select scripts and the right to have a say in the final cut of her films (Balio 1976).</p>
                <p>If Pickford's business acumen contrasted with the image of 'Little Mary', then so did her private life. Initially married to Owen Moore when both were acting at Biograph, the marriage collapsed amidst Moore's drunkenness and Pickford's affair with fellow screen idol, Douglas Fairbanks. In the press, an image of marital bliss was conveyed, working to achieve moral closure between the on-screen and off-screen lives of Pickford. Divorce from Moore in 1920 and Pickford's subsequent marriage to Fairbanks could have fractured that closure. De Cordova observes, however, that Pickford's life neatly avoided becoming an early source of the scandal discourse. Instead of scandal, 'the Pickford-Fairbanks affair was recuperated in a family discourse', with the two stars 'touted as the country's ideal couple' (1990: 123).</p>
                <p>Pickford fought to achieve independence in her dealings with the studios, making her most direct gesture in 1919 when, following rumours the studios were intending to cap star salaries, she and Fairbanks joined with Griffith and Charlie Chaplin (the most highly priced male star of the period) to form United Artists (UA). United Artists functioned as a distribution company for the films produced by the star names, placing the owners in a position where they could extend their economic power by negotiating more broadly across the film industry. Tino Balio explains:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>As heads of their own production companies, [the stars] controlled all artistic aspects of their work - from the creation of the scenario, to the selection of the director, to the final cut. By organising a distribution company, they could oversee, in addition, the crucial function of sales, advertising, and publicity. (1987: 10)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This power was evident with Pickford's first UA release, Paul Powell's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pollyanna</em>(1919) in which she reprised her little girl image in the title role. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pollyanna</em>was produced through Pickford's own company and distributed by UA. Whereas the established business practice in the exhibition sector was to lease prints from distributors for a fixed fee,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pollyanna</em>was made available only on the basis of both a guaranteed base rental fee together with a percentage split of box office income. Despite complaints, exhibitors agreed to UA's terms, transforming the business model for dealings between distributors and exhibitors.</p>
                <p>During the 1920s, Pickford's career would experience rises and falls in the star's critical and financial status. Despite taking more adult roles, the movie-going public were reluctant to let Pickford shed her child-woman image. From its inception, United Artists experienced decades of financial crises, the cause of which has been partly attributed to the company's star management. When Pickford eventually sold her UA stock in 1951 to Arthur B. Krim and Robert S. Benjamin, partners in the law firm Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin and Krim, she described UA as 'sick unto death' (quoted in Balio 1976: 9). At the height of her appeal however, Pickford had clearly demonstrated the wide ranging power that the star could wield across all sectors of the film industry. Pickford's significance is not limited to the silent era. She exemplified many of the trends that would develop the Hollywood star system in future decades. In particular, Pickford showed how the star could have the ability to use his or her popular status as leverage to demand from producers rapid rises in salary payments. Her career also paved the way for stars to participate in box office earnings from the films they appeared in and represented the benefits to be had from stars choosing to form their own independent production companies. These trends would all become key characteristics of the star system following the decline of the vertically integrated studio system that dominated Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s (see the following chapter). Pickford was therefore not only a product of the star system in the cinema. She showed how it was possible for stars to find ways to work that system for their own gain.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Foundations of Hollywood Stardom</em></p>
                <p>The star system in American cinema developed through the detailed division of labour, the redefinition of performance space in narrative film, and the widespread distribution of knowledge about individual film performers. Tracing the emergence between 1907-1922 of different types of discourse about film performers, Richard de Cordova not only provides an early history of the star system in American cinema but also identifies levels of knowledge relevant to reading and understanding star images at all stages of cinema history. While the discourse on acting reveals the general labour of film performance, the naming of picture personalities makes known individual performers through their on-screen professional existence. Naming enables the construction of the personality's image and identity across films, but also in other media such as newspapers and magazines.</p>
                <p>De Cordova reserves star discourse to describe the extension of knowledge about film performers beyond on-screen appearances and into the off-screen lives of performers. With the star scandal, a star's private life becomes further divided between a publicly controlled private-image and a hidden secret private-image. From de Cordova's study, a general definition emerges of the star 'as actor (professional manipulator of signs), as picture personality (as a personality extrapolated from films), and as a star (as someone with a private life distinct from screen image)' (1990: 146-7). Although the discourses of actor, personality and star become levels of knowledge, with each seeming to add a further degree of depth to a star's image, these levels do not operate separately but work together as what de Cordova calls 'collapsing levels of identity' (p. 111).</p>
                <p>As the example of Pickford shows, the Hollywood industry and the stars themselves were quick to exploit the value of star identity as a personal monopoly. Naming is essential to making that identity into a commercial and legal entity and the star system would develop through the use of such mechanisms to construct star identities and to use those identities as a means of promotion in the public domain. Subsequent phases in the development of the system would therefore be marked by transitions in the film industry as a whole which influenced this control and use of star identities.</p>
