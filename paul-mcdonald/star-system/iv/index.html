                <p>With the star system in place, Hollywood worked hard to find effective means to exploit the identities of popular performers. By the end of the 1920s, economic control of the American film industry was concentrated in the hands of five leading companies: Paramount, Warner Bros., the Fox Film Corporation (Twentieth Century Fox after 1935), Radio Keith-Orpheum (RKO), and MGM, the film production studio of the exhibition conglomerate Loew's Inc. In this period, the star system operated under the general direction of these studios. The studio era of the 1930s and 1940s was a period in which Hollywood worked actively to make and market its stars. Stars became a vital asset in maintaining the hegemony of the major studios over the whole domestic film industry, with the effect that control of the film market required the strong control of its stars. This chapter will look at the structural conditions that enabled the Hollywood studios to dominate the film market in the United States and the ways in which those studios created, sold and controlled their stars.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">American Cinema in the 1930s and 1940s</em></p>
                <p>The power of the 'Big Five' studios, as they became known, was based on maintaining subsidiaries that engaged in the production, distribution and exhibition of films. With interests in all sectors of the film business, the major studios formed vertically integrated corporations, capable of recognising profits from all stages of the value chain by owning the means to make, sell and show films. Three other studios held a significant presence in the industry: Universal and Columbia functioned as producers and distributors, and United Artists distributed the films of major independent producers. Without their own exhibition outlets, the 'Little Three' released their films through the theatre chains run by the majors.</p>
                <p>Although the studios have historically remained famous for the films they made, it was the control of exhibition rather than production that accounted for the power of the studios. The major studios controlled the domestic film market in the United States through their ownership of firstrun theatre houses. For example, Paramount evolved from the theatre business started by Adolph Zukor, and became the largest of the vertically integrated companies after merger with the theatre operator Publix in 1925. Of the assets owned by the majors, investment was divided approximately into five per cent production and one per cent distribution, with exhibition accounting for the remaining ninety-four per cent. As Douglas Gomery argues, to gain 'a clear picture of the studio era one has to characterise the Big Five as diversified theatre chains, producing features, shorts, cartoons, and newsreels to fill their houses' (1986: 8).</p>
                <p>While the power of the majors lay in their control of exhibition, in the domestic market the majority of theatres were owned by large or small independent exhibitors. The collective theatre holdings of the Big Five accounted for only twenty-five per cent of the total theatres in the United States. Ownership of theatres by the majors was, however, strategically planned to maximise earnings from admissions. The situation varied between different areas and locations. In some locations, the majors dominated the local market by acquiring or building the main first-run houses. Elsewhere, particularly in the largest cities of the United States, neighbourhood or subsequent-run theatres were more important. Theatre building and buying therefore followed local patterns of movie-going (see Huettig 1944).</p>
                <p>Although the majors were in principle competitors, they nevertheless colluded in mutually beneficial ways. To meet the demand for new product in their own theatres, the majors would book films from other members of the Big Five and the Little Three. Also, the geographical siting of theatres in the domestic market was divided up so as to prevent the major exhibitors encroaching on territory controlled by other vertically integrated studios. Paramount dominated the South, New England, and the upper Midwest, with Fox taking the Far West, Warners controlling the mid- Atlantic states, and Loew's and RKO dividing New York, New Jersey and Ohio between them (see Gomery 1986). The first-run theatres of the majors therefore represented only a fraction of the total theatres in the country, however ownership was strategically organised to control the entire domestic market.</p>
                <p>Alongside the theatres they directly owned, the majors also organised deals with independent theatres. Outside of the films produced by majors, it would be impossible for independent exhibitors to find any suppliers with a sufficient volume of films to fill their screens all year round. Although small independent producers did exist, independent exhibitors were reliant on the majors for supplying the bulk of the films shown. This situation placed the majors in a position to force non-competitive trading practices in their dealings with independent exhibitors. Block-booking involved distributors selling films as a package rather than individually and any block of films would combine major quality releases with more average and poor product. A price was set for the whole package, offering top titles at a lower price than they could be bought individually, while effectively raising the price of poor films. For the major distributors, blockbooking had the advantages of guaranteeing sales of films in volume and spreading marketing costs across a whole group of films rather than individual titles. Blind-selling was a related practice, through which films were sold to exhibitors with maybe only a catalogue description or number as a reference. The status and profitability of the first-run theatres owned by the majors was protected by the further trade practices of clearance (determining the number of days to pass between runs in theatres) and zoning (setting regional areas in which clearance conditions applied). Large independent chains were able to use their size to negotiate the terms set by the majors but smaller independent exhibitors were compelled to accept such terms.</p>
                <p>The most important effect of block-booking was the closing of the market to independent producers. For any exhibitor, the amount of playing time available in any week or year was limited. The first-run market, in which the highest revenues could be earned, was dominated by the chains owned by the majors. Through block-booking, independent exhibitors were compelled to buy films in such volume that their screens would be filled all year round with the supply of films from the majors. As the small independent exhibitors were dependent on continuing their relations with the majors for supplying both the quality and quantity of titles needed to fill theatres, there was little or no space in the market for independent producers. Control of exhibition therefore enabled the majors to collude to the mutual benefit of each other, while also preventing the growth of competition. By concentrating control of the market in the hands of so few companies, the studio system of the 1930s and 1940s formed a powerful oligopoly (see Balio 1985b).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stars and Studios</em></p>
                <p>Domination of the domestic film market by the major studios determined the conditions under which all categories of film performers could work in Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s. The majors instituted mechanisms designed to produce and reproduce the star phenomenon by actively working to manufacture and take legal control of star identities. To retain control of their talent, the studios employed stars on contracts which could run for a maximum of seven years, and which were frequently written in terms that allowed the studios to manage and effectively exploit the images of stars. With the studios controlling exhibition, even star performers would find that it was virtually impossible to work outside the studio system. However, while the stars needed the studios, the studios also needed the stars. The power of star image was recognised not only by the studios but also by the stars themselves, and the period experienced significant instances of struggles between stars and the studios.</p>
                <p>At the height of their power, the studios would keep many stars under contract, providing a 'stable* of performers from which to draw when making casting decisions across the studio's output. In order to achieve variety and feed the uncertainties of changing audience tastes, all the major studios established their own departments for discovering and developing new talent. Through his interviews with former studio employees, Ronald Davis (1993) uncovers the common processes that hopeful performers would have to pass through before they would be signed by a studio. Each studio employed their own talent scouts, for example Solly Baiano at Warner Bros., Lucille Ryman and Al Trescony at MGM, Milton Lewis at Paramount, and Ivan Kahn at Twentieth Century Fox. Scouts attended the theatres and night-clubs of New York and Los Angeles in the search for potential new stars. Other talent would come from vaudeville, burlesque and radio.</p>
                <p>Scouts filed reports on interesting performers, which were circulated to studio executives, producers and directors. Those performers who caught the eye would be asked to read a scene for the scout who may then recommend that the performer attend the studio for tests. In tests, the tryout performers would prepare a suitable scene selected by the studio's drama coach. Usually hopefuls would have a silent test, shot in black and white in a studio, followed by a sound test. Based on these tests, the casting director would decide who would receive a contract, with the final approval resting with the studio head. Contracts offered starting salaries of between $75 and $250 a week, with a six-month option that allowed the studio to drop a performer after that period or raise his or her salary. Once signed to the studio, new talent would undergo an apprenticeship, during which time the studio would begin to mould the images of contract players. Apprentices would receive tuition from the studio's own speech and diction coaches, together with acting classes with the drama coach and, in some cases, singing and dancing lessons. Other optional lessons were offered in etiquette, movement, fencing, horseback riding, swimming, boxing and languages. Advice on fashion, make-up, and skin care were also available.</p>
                <p>The earliest years of the film star system had put a high premium on the circulation and signification of a performer's name. Where an apprentice performer's actual name was regarded as inappropriate for his or her image, the studios made changes. Through make-up and hairstyling, alterations were also made to physical appearances. When their preparation was complete, newcomers would serve an apprenticeship by taking supporting roles chosen by the casting director. It would be usual to first try new talent in B-pictures. Frequently the placing of a new contract player would alternate a starring role in a B-feature, with a role opposite an established star in a major feature. Young performers of similar status might be paired in productions designed to test the partnership.</p>
                <p>While stars could be profitable for the studios, they were also costly. From the earliest years of the star system, producers expressed concern that popular box office performance would lead to the escalation of performer earnings. Stars of the silent era, like Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin, had set the trend for stars to demand dramatic rises in their earnings. In the studio system, stars received salaries at levels that confirmed the biggest names as Hollywood's aristocracy. In research for his study of the 'movie colony', Leo Rosten (1941) found that in 1939, of respondents who had obtained some form of work acting in the movies, nearly eighty per cent earned under $1,000 a week, with six per cent receiving over $2,000 a week. In the same year, figures showed around sixty-nine per cent of actors earning less that $10,000 for the year, with four per cent enjoying salaries in excess of $100,000 a year. For many leading stars, income levels easily topped those of the highest paid studio executives.</p>
                <p>During the early 1930s, the studios witnessed a wave of unionisation by labour groups organising to achieve representation and recognition for collective bargaining over pay and conditions. Compared to the skilled crafts, creative talent organised relatively late. Actors Equity was established in 1913 as the representative of stage actors. After winning recognition from Broadway producers in 1919, for several years Equity tried unsuccessfully to unionise film performers. In 1927, the formation of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was created as a professional body to represent five categories of creative labour: producers, directors, writers, technicians, and actors. Membership of the Academy was not open but restricted by invitation to those figures, including stars, believed to have made a significant contribution to the industry. Several functions were performed by the Academy, including its role as a collective negotiating agency in the conciliation and arbitration of labour disputes (see Clark 1995). As a producer-backed and controlled body, however, the Academy operated as a company union, proving to be ineffectual when representing the interests of its members in disputes with the studios.</p>
                <p>The representation of screen actors by the Academy was tested twice during 1933. First, using the crisis conditions of the Depression as a convenient excuse for salary cuts, the studios introduced an eight-week salary waiver for employees. While raising objections to an all-out withdrawal of salaries, the Academy provided the studios with an incomelinked formula for proportionally cutting salaries. Employees on the lowest rates of pay lost nothing, but others forfeited anything from twenty-five per cent of salary, while the highest paid, including stars, lost half their income (see Ross 1941). Secondly, when President Roosevelt passed the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) in June, requesting all industries to draw up codes for stabilising the economy, studio executives and producers took the opportunity to draft articles intended to increase their control over stars. Articles were presented which intended to contain the salary demands of stars by prohibiting star-raiding between studios and preventing competitive bidding for stars. The code also sought to bring agents under the control of studio management, directly threatening the status of agents as independent mediators between talent and studio management. In response, the Academy adopted a moderate position by only asking for modifications to the articles rather than their wholesale rejection.</p>
                <p>While these articles were later withdrawn, the disputes that ensued around the studio code exposed the Academy as a producer-controlled company union, unable to fight for the interests of screen actors. Consequently, in June 1933, performers independently organised by forming the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). While SAG became an agency of organised labour, David Prindle (1988) notes that choosing the identity of a guild, rather than a union, placed SAG in a non-militant relationship with studio management. Prindle argues that the social and political conservatism of many SAG members immediately avoided the militancy of organised labour, with the title 'Guild* suggesting instead a 'medieval association of artisans' (1988: 22). Another distinctive feature of SAG was that the body was established as a corporation. Prindle regards this as a move designed to attract stars to the organisation by insulating members from the financial responsibility they would otherwise incur for collective action.</p>
                <p>In the years after its formation, SAG would engage in disputes with studio management, frequently uniting in support of other labour groups. However, the political credentials of SAG were clear, for these disagreements were usually settled at the expense of those other labour organisations. For example, in April 1937, SAG offered its support to the more leftist Federation of Motion Picture Crafts (FMPC), who were striking over the issue of recognition. When SAG leaked rumours of supporting strike action, senior figures in the guild met privately with Louis B. Mayer of MGM to demand studio recognition of SAG as the official bargaining agency for screen actors. After Mayer agreed on behalf of the studios to the guild's demands, SAG immediately withdrew support for the strike, a betrayal that eventually saw the collapse of the FMPC.</p>
                <p>It is debatable to what extent stars can play an active role in organised labour. While stars could raise the profile of SAG both inside and outside the industry, they were also the quintessential embodiment of sheer individualism and therefore appeared to occupy a difficult position in relation to collective action. SAG represented all screen actors and included star names amongst its members. Eddie Cantor, the popular radio and film comedian, became the second president of SAG in 1933, and Fredric March, Adolphe Menjou and Robert Montgomery were elected vice-presidents. Star power could be effective. For example, Cantor used his personal friendship with President Roosevelt to have removed those clauses in the draft NIRA code that were of concern to the guild.</p>
                <p>Stars were, however, also the elite of the performer labour pool, and as such enjoyed privileges that were not granted to other actors. The membership of SAG straddled the broad range of labour power differences amongst the community of film actors. Stars would have a stake in the collective agreements reached between SAG and studio management, however it was the case that stars had most to gain from individually negotiating over the uses of their labour and images. Like all agencies of organised labour, SAG was formed to negotiate the terms of collective bargaining. With stars, negotiations were not based on the collective terms and conditions but the particular uses of the star's personal monopoly. Frequently, the highly restrictive terms offered by the studios in the contracts of stars became a matter of heated dispute, and several stars would engage in personal battles with the studios. These individual instances of opposition are returned to later in this chapter.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: MGM - 'more Stars than there are in Heaven'</em></p>
                <p>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) remained at the forefront of the studio system throughout the 1930s and into the early 1940s. During the 1930s, MGM's profits consistently exceeded those of any other studio, and only dropped behind Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox during the Second World War. MGM stood for Hollywood glamour in the studio era, boasting the claim that the studio employed under contract 'more stars than there are in heaven'.</p>
                <p>Although identified as a studio in its own right, MGM was actually the film production and distribution company of a larger entertainment conglomerate, Loew's Inc. Marcus Loew founded his People's Vaudeville Company in 1904, running cheap 'nickel vaudeville' with shows combining live variety entertainment and film shows (see Gomery 1986). Building a lucrative chain of theatres, Loew aimed to feed his screens with in-house productions, buying the film production and distribution company Metro Pictures in 1920, followed in 1924 by acquisition of the struggling Goldwyn Pictures. Ex-Metro executive Louis B. Mayer was appointed to oversee production and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was formed. A key figure at MGM was the young producer Irving Thalberg. Before illness in 1932, Thalberg oversaw all productions at MGM, and his role exemplified what Janet Staiger (1985b) calls the central producer system of production. When Mayer down-graded Thalberg's responsibilities by reorganising the studio around the producer-unit system of production, the producer still packaged some of the most star-studded projects produced by MGM before his death in 1936.</p>
                <p>Although Loew's business was founded on ownership of theatres, the number of cinema houses owned by the company was substantially lower than the other major studios. For this reason, MGM's success was always highly dependent on sales of its releases to the theatres of the other studios and independents. Douglas Gomery (1986) views this condition as requiring MGM to consistently produce high profile, popular releases. This imperative resulted in films with spectacular, glossy production values but also, Gomery argues, the largest stable of glamorous stars contracted to any studio.</p>
                <p>MGM's glamour was well represented by Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and Clark Gable. Mayer signed Garbo when she left Sweden and made her Hollywood debut in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Torrent</em>(1926) before reaching prominence opposite John Gilbert in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Flesh and the Devil</em>(1926). Garbo's image was founded on romantic mystique, a quality which, in the context of Hollywood, was bound up with her sense of European otherness. MGM exploited that mystique to good effect. Moving into the sound era, MGM created an event around the marketing of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Anna Christie</em> (1930) with the advertising line 'Garbo Talks!' offering the teasing prospect of hearing the Scandinavian star speak. As her box-office power began to wane in the late 1930s, MGM broke the icy cool image by casting Garbo in the extremely successful comedy<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ninotchka</em>(1939), acknowledging the casting against type by advertising 'Garbo Laughs!'.</p>
                <p>Although stars like Garbo and Gable brought charm and sex appeal to the studio, MGM's star stable was not all glamour. During the early 1930s, the studio's most popular star was Marie Dressier, who was already fiftyeight at the time she first worked for MGM in 1927. Working in the historical context of the Depression years, Dressler's popularity may be explained by the type of hard-working and resilient characters she portrayed. If Garbo and Gable represented the glamorous star, Dressier could be described as a 'down-to-earth star' (Balio 1995:146), a category which saw her well matched with the equally down-to-earth Wallace Beery. Dressier and Beery were cast opposite each other in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Min and Bill</em>(1930) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tugboat Annie</em>(1933). Beery had a varied background in entertainment, working in circus, variety and Broadway theatre before entering films. After moving from Paramount to join MGM, Beery appeared to critical acclaim in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Big House</em>(1930) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Champ</em>(1931), and gave a memorable performance as Long John Silver in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Treasure Island</em>(1934).</p>
                <p>The MGM stable also nurtured a number of child and teenage stars, including Freddie Bartholomew, Jackie Cooper, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. Mickey Rooney was not only the most popular of this collection of young actors, but during the 1930s he also occupied the top slot in the star rankings three years in a row. After appearing as the character Mickey McGuire in a series of silent comedies between 1927 and 1933, Rooney signed to MGM in 1934. He played the central character in the Andy Hardy series of fifteen features, including<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Family Affair</em>(1937). In the late 1930s, Rooney began his partnership with Garland, MGM's other leading young performer, and the two were teamed across several movies, including<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Thoroughbreds Don't Cry</em>(1937),<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Love Finds Andy Hardy</em>(1938), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Babes in Arms</em>(1939),<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Strike Up the Band</em>(1940),<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Babes on Broadway</em> (1941) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Girl Crazy</em>(1943).</p>
                <p>Thalberg frequently brought together MGM's star stable in showcase productions. Based on Vicki Baum's best-selling novel 'Menschen im Hotel',<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Grand Hotel</em>(1932) offered the paradoxical construction of a stardriven ensemble, with a cast that featured Garbo, Crawford, Beery and brothers John and Lionel Barrymore. Thalberg united the Barrymore brothers in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arsene Lupin</em>(1932) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dinner at Eight</em>(1933) and created a showcase of Barrymore siblings when the brothers were cast opposite their sister Ethel in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rasputin and the Empress</em>(1932). The star ensemble was most directly foregrounded in the short<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jackie Cooper's Christmas</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Party</em>(1932), in which young Jackie Cooper decides to throw a party and is helped out by his other friends at MGM - including Beery, Gable, Dressier, Shearer, and Lionel Barrymore, amongst others - who all appeared as themselves.</p>
                <p>MGM's stable of stars carried the studio through the 1930s. While other studios faced severe financial problems in the Depression years, MGM remained profitable. In the economic conditions of the 1930s, Loew's comparatively small chain of theatres was an advantage, demanding less investment and expenditure on general running costs than the larger chains. During the war and the immediate post-war years of the 1940s, however, the domestic film market enjoyed a boom period, and the size of Loew's chain prevented the company from adequately capitalising on this growth (see Gomery 1986). Consequently, MGM dropped behind the other majors, precipitating a downward spiral in fortunes which even the studio's star power could not reverse.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Selling Stars</em></p>
                <p>Stars are crucial to the distribution of films. Distribution combines the functions of selling movies to exhibitors and marketing films to the general public. Starting with the circulation of the discourses of stardom before 1920, star identities not only became known but also marketable. During the 1930s and 1940s, the studios all maintained publicity departments with responsibility for constructing and disseminating a star's image across the media of posters, photographs, newspapers, magazines and radio. Publicity circulated a star's image both among fellow members of the industry and the general public.</p>
                <p>At each studio, there would be a head or director of publicity responsible for managing the organisation of marketing campaigns. For example, MGM had Howard Strickling, while the same role was occupied by Harry Brand at Twentieth Century Fox, and Bob Taplinger at Warner Bros. At MGM the publicity department employed a large staff of approximately sixty, who individually took responsibility for three or four stars and liaison with a handful of national press correspondents (see Davis 1993). During the making of a film, the studio would assign a unit publicist to create and manage the publicity surrounding an individual production. Leading up to the release of a film, publicity departments would prepare stories from the set about the production and its stars, which were then positioned by 'planters' in trade and news media in ways intended to maximise exposure - publicity was not an afterthought in the production process. As one former publicist commented, 'publicity began when Warner Bros, bought a story; it never stopped until the picture was released* (quoted in Davis 1993: 142).</p>
                <p>Aside from the in-house studio publicists, relatively unknown performers would hire an external publicity agent in the hope that such services may help the performer achieve star status (see Powdermaker 1951). Established names would also use publicity agents, either to cultivate competitive interest for the star's services inside the industry, or else to find ways beyond the studio publicity machine by which to manage the ways in which his or her image was directed at the public. In the latter case, however, hiring a publicity agent represented a bid by the star to exercise some degree of independent control over his or her image. Publicity agents were therefore not welcomed by the studios and stars were actively discouraged from hiring such mediators (see Gaines 1992).</p>
                <p>To measure the value of stars, research companies were hired to conduct studies to assess the popularity of performers. Various methods of assessment were used to quantify popularity, including measuring the volume of fan mail received by a star, or analysing box-office statistics to assess a star's economic value. However, use of star ratings was seen to be a more scientific test of popularity. Ratings studies would look at the appeal of either a group of stars or conduct in-depth studies into an individual star's popularity. Star ratings were based on interviews with movie-goers, who were invited to indicate their response to the names of well-known performers (see Handel 1950). Ratings assessed a performer's popularity over a period of time and relative to that of other performers. Analysis would also be conducted into the effect of different types of films on a star's popularity, together with studies measuring popularity against audience demographic and social variables of sex, age, income and geography. Other studies would assess the 'want-to-see' factor, speculating on the popularity of a star's appearance in a forthcoming film.</p>
                <p>In her study of Bette Davis's early career at Warner Bros., Cathy Klaprat examines how the star's image was reworked across publicity media and her narrative roles. Davis came to public prominence with her performance as Madge in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cabin in the Cotton</em>(1932), a role Klaprat describes as a 'rich spoiled flirt' (1985: 356). Advertising for the film constructed the image of Davis as a blonde sex bomb. The poster portrayed Davis and male star Richard Barthelmess in a kiss, eliciting audiences with the call 'Meet a new kind of temptress! Flaming as southern suns, bewitching as plantation moons, she'll teach you a new kind of love'. Klaprat suggests publicity worked on this occasion to depict Davis as a Move expert' (p. 366). After her appearance in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cabin in the Cotton,</em>the trade paper<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Variety</em> ranked Davis as the top box-office attraction for 1932.</p>
                <p>Building on her success, the following year Warner Bros, cast Davis again in the role of the sexy blonde. Publicity for<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ex-Lady</em>(1933) sold the new film through making direct reference to Davis's role in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cabin in the</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cotton</em>but when the film failed at the box office, Davis's name was not amongst the 1933 list of box-office leaders. Davis was loaned out to RKO for<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Human Bondage</em>(1934), the film which Kalprat sees as redefining Davis's image around the role of the vamp. Davis's character, Mildred Rogers, destroys the gentle Philip Carey, played by Leslie Howard. Initially, publicity down-played Davis's presence in the film, with her name in small print below that of Howard. When the film performed well at the box office, Davis's name increased in size.</p>
                <p>After her stint at RKO, Davis returned to Warner Bros, and the studio did not revert to the image of Davis as sexy flirt but instead capitalised on the image of the man-eating vamp she had so evocatively created while on loan.<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bordertown</em>(1935), starring Paul Muni, was included on the Warner production schedule in June 1934, but Davis was only cast as Marie Roark after<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Human Bondage</em>proved successful. Publicity now linked Davis to her previous appearance as the vamp, and this image was replayed in her next role, appearing opposite Franchot Tone as Joyce Heath in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dangerous</em> (1935). As Klaprat observes, the advertising for<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dangerous</em>foregrounded the vamp image, explicitly naming Davis in ways that linked her narrative role to the star's own identity. For example, posters announced 'Bette Davis smacks 'em where it hurts', 'Manwrecking Bette is on the manhunt again', and 'One look into Bette Davis' eyes and Tone joins Howard and Muni in succumbing to her fatal attraction' (Klaprat 1985: 368). Publicity therefore worked at constructing the vamp as a definition of Davis's fictional and real life identities.</p>
                <p>To avoid the dangers of exhausting Davis's star value, Warner Bros. experimented with the mechanism of off-casting - giving the star roles that contradicted her vamp image. Klaprat sees Davis cast in a series of roles as 'the good woman', a type in which she appears as the saviour rather than destroyer of men. This new image first appeared with<em class="notranslate" translate="no">That</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Certain Woman</em>(1937), after which Klaprat observes a pattern emerging as Davis's roles alternate between the good woman and the vamp. In<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Letter</em>(1940), Davis returned to the vamp, followed by the good woman in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All This and Heaven Too</em>(1940). This pattern continued with her vampish roles in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Little Foxes</em>(1941) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">In This Our Life</em>(1942), and compassionate roles in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Great Lie</em>(1941) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Now Voyager</em>(1942). As Klaprat suggests, 'Offcasting not only provided the variation to sustain audience interest, but also served to enhance the image of the star as a great performer' (1985: 375). This diversity of roles itself became an image that could be publicised, with advertisements for<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Corn is Green</em>(1945) claiming 'There are as many Bette Davises as there are Bette Davisstarring pictures! That's part of Miss Davis's greatness: the ability to make each character she plays stand by itself, a distinct and memorable triumph of screen acting' (quoted in Klaprat 1985: 375).</p>
                <p>Publicists would plant stories about stars in the trade and popular press but the primary publicity tool was the press book. Publicity departments would prepare a separate press book for each film released. Press books were mailed to exhibitors with the intention of offering theatres useful information and advice for publicising films. It was standard for the press book to include a cast list and synopsis of the film. The book would provide a display of advertisements and posters available to exhibitors for display in windows, theatre lobbies or the local press (see Sennett 1999). The publicity department would also send press books to newspapers, including prepared reviews for those local papers and radio stations that did not hire their own film critics. These various materials all found a point of focus and coherence in the images of stars. Press books included short biographies of the leading players in the films, accompanied by photographic portraits of stars. The graphic style of posters and advertisements would also foreground the role of stars. For<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dark Victory</em>(1939), the Warner Bros, publicity department prepared reviews focusing on the performance of Bette Davis, along with printed quotes from the star and her character, and a range of posters portraying Davis. The images of stars were therefore central to publicity campaigns, and in the assortment of materials included in the press book, exhibitors were offered a pre-packaged version of a star's image available for local marketing drives.</p>
                <p>Stars were also used in other methods of promotion, including personal appearances and road shows. Personal appearances would see stars turning up for glittery premieres in main cities. For the premiere of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gone With the Wind</em>(1939), MGM not only transported the entire cast to Atlanta but also other stars contracted to the studio, including Claudette Colbert and Carole Lombard (see Sennett 1999). Personal appearances by musical stars were particularly effective, for a star could display his or her talents in song-and-dance numbers performed for the assembled public. For dramatic performers, the studio may have writers draft a special short scene for live performance, in which stars would play the roles in which they appeared in the film. Road shows required stars to make a succession of appearances on a tour of the cities and towns where a new release was opening. Bette Davis added to her reputation as a rebellious star when she flatly refused to participate in the ordeal and indignity of these tours (see Sennett 1999).</p>
                <p>The marketing appeal of stars was not employed purely for the promotion of movies. Stars were also used to promote the sale of other products in secondary or ancillary markets. Charles Eckert (1978) sees the growth of a consumer economy in the United States during the 1920s as a period in which the film industry intensified efforts to link up with the high street in using star images to market household and fashion products. As suggested in the previous chapter, stars represent the ideological values of wealth, freedom and individualism on which a consumer economy is built. During the 1930s, stars were central to the development of Hollywood as a showcase for fashions, furnishings, accessories, cosmetics and other items available on the high street. An important development in the relationship between Hollywood and the high street came in 1930 when Bernard Waldman established the Modern Merchandizing Bureau. Waldman produced fashion lines based on clothing worn by female stars in films. All the studios (except Warner Bros., which launched its own Studio Styles in a similar capacity) provided Waldman with sketches or photographs of styles prior to the release of a film, and manufacturers would then produce styles based on these designs. The Bureau would send the completed garments to retailers, accompanied by publicity materials on the stars and the films. Initially, the studios offered styles for no charge, believing in the value of free advertising. Waldman opened his chain of Cinema Fashions shops and by 1937, the company owned 400 shops while also providing star-endorsed styles to nearly 1,400 other outlets.</p>
                <p>With star-related promotions for cosmetics and toiletries, the Hollywood showcase addressed the market in ways that perceived women to be the primary category of consumer. Recognising the value of ancillary markets for the promotion of female stars, Hollywood cultivated the style of leading female stars such as Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer. It is important to also note the significance of this star glamour on the high street during the Depression years of the 1930s. Ready-to-wear lines offered the image of film star glamour but at relatively affordable prices. Star styles could thus promise some escape from real world conditions. Outside the United States, British women have recalled the enjoyment of sewing their own home-made copies of the styles worn by Hollywood's female stars during the Second World War, off-setting the hardship of wartime life (see Stacey 1994). Such actions are significant, for they indicate the pleasure of star identification, expressed in tangible forms produced outside of the consumer economy.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Shirley Temple and the Business of Childhood</em></p>
                <p>For four years between 1935 and 1938, Shirley Temple headed the list of top box-office stars in Hollywood. After successful starring roles in seven features during 1934, a special Academy award was bestowed on Temple - a miniature Oscar given in recognition of the child phenomenon. Temple's success came from how she represented a concept of childhood that could appeal not only to children but adults as well. As Charles Eckert (1974) suggests, Temple's popularity was made through her appeal to universal: her cuteness, precocious talents and invocation of parental love. That vision of childhood was marketed not only through the star's films but also a huge merchandising industry that grew up around selling the Temple concept to Americans.</p>
                <p>Temple's screen career started at Educational Films, a production company specialising in comedy shorts. In the early 1930s, Educational began production of the<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Baby Burlesks,</em>a series of comedy shorts featuring child performers in satires of box-office hits from the time. Temple debuted for Educational in the unreleased<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Runt Page</em>(1932), a satire of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Front Page</em>(1931), before appearing in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">War Babies</em>(1932), a comedy take on<em class="notranslate" translate="no">What Price Glory?</em>(1926). At the same time as working for Educational, Temple was loaned out to other studios, including supporting roles on<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Red-Haired Alibi</em>(1932) for Tower Productions,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Out</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All Night</em>(1933) for Universal,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">To the Last Man</em>(1933) at Paramount, and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">As</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the Earth Turns</em>(1933) for Warner Bros.</p>
                <p>Temple's work on features provided a stepping stone into the studio system. After an unaccredited appearance in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Carolina</em>(1934) for Fox Film, the studio conducted a number of 'try outs' to test her singing and dancing skills. Temple abilities were showcased in the revue film<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stand up</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">and Cheer</em>(1934) after which, on 9 February 1934, she signed a seven-year contract with Fox. The following year, Fox merged with Twentieth Century Pictures, and Temple stayed with the studio until 1940. It was during her years at Fox that Temple would be transformed into a child star, yet it was on loan to Paramount when she received her first significant popular and critical acclaim with a role in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Little Miss Marker</em>(1934). When Paramount offered to buy out Temple's contract, offering her $1,000 a week against the $150 she was earning, Fox saw off the move to raid the studio's new talent. A revised contract was issued for $1,200 a week, rising by increments of $1,000 a week annually for seven years. The contract also included the conditions that Temple make only three films per year and her mother, Gertrude, be paid $150 a week to act as the child's coach (see Edwards 1988). Shirley Temple's rapid rise to popularity meant that within a year Gertrude was able to re-negotiate a salary of $4,000 a week for her daughter and $500 for herself, with a $20,000 bonus for each film completed.</p>
                <p>Temple's films dramatised both the anxieties and escapist fantasies of childhood. As Jeanine Basinger describes, the Shirley Temple film involved a familiar formula (1975: 11-13):</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Shirley played an orphaned child adopted by a rich father . . . or rich mother . . . or perhaps a rich grandfather or grandmother. Or she played a child whose father wandered off absentmindedly, leaving her to cope. She was torn out of the arms of benefactor after benefactor ('Oh, please, Cap, don't let them take me away'... 'I want my daddy' ... 'No, no, I don't want to go to any old orphanage'). This basic ingredient of the child alone was mixed together with crusts of old codgers, heaps of adoring adults, pinches of heartbreak, and generous helpings of poverty (which quickly melted into lavish living) - all stirred up with the subtlety of a McCormick reaper and garnished with a few songs and dances.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>According to this narrative logic, the loss of one family is replaced by an idealised version of the family as an all-providing, all-caring unit. Through this drama of the family, Temple was able to appeal to both child and adult audiences. Basinger argues that adult audiences were drawn to Temple through the fantasy of childish escape she represented: The adult's fantasy was not so much to have a little girl like her (although that might do), but actually<em class="notranslate" translate="no">be</em>her. To be taken care of, fussed over, listened to' (1975: 14 (emphasis in original)).</p>
                <p>Eckert (1974) situates Temple's popularity against the background of crisis during the Depression era, and explains the star's appeal through the capacity of her image to displace the economic realities of the period. During the early 1930s, Eckert discusses how government-appointed bodies mounted an ideological war against appeals for state welfare.</p>
                <p>Instead of state-funded welfare relief, the President's Organisation on Unemployment Relief and the Committee on Mobilization of Relief Resources espoused the values of charity against welfare, the act of giving rather than taking. Although not a direct reflection of state policy, Eckert views Temple's image as having a relevance for the period through performing a similar work of ideological displacement. In her films, Shirley's characters were frequently seen to come from humble backgrounds, however the realities of those social and political conditions were effaced. Instead, Shirley was seen to put hardship behind her with an overflowing bounty of love. Shirley solved the problems of others by her pure and unselfish acts of giving. This ideology of charity leads Eckert to argue that 'since her love was indiscriminate, extending to pinched misers or to common hobos, it was a social, even a political, force on a par with the idea of democracy or the Constitution' (1974: 68). Ideologically, therefore, the Temple image displaced the social and economic conditions of the era by offering a natural solution to the world's problems based on faith in the transformative power of love.</p>
                <p>Such was the appeal of Temple's image that before the end of her first year at Fox, the studio was efficiently marketing the star in a range of secondary markets outside the film business, across a range of merchandise. In October 1934,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Playthings Magazine</em>carried the first advert for the Shirley Temple Doll from the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company (see Basinger 1975). A full wardrobe of clothes and other accessories was produced for the dolls. Sales of the dolls were so successful that in the first years of her career, Temple was earning more from the licensing of her image to Ideal than from her film work. Shirley Temple comics, colouring books and sheet music appeared, together with endorsed products such as soap, clothes, mugs, playhouses, and watches.</p>
                <p>Although the narratives of Temple's films would achieve a sentimental resolution of childhood anxieties, Basinger regards Temple as offering a mixture of mischievous 'salty little wench' and 'out-and-out baby sexpot' (14). Both in her on- and off-screen lives, Temple displayed her gutsy handling of adult authority figures. On occasions, Temple appeared in roles as the 'little wife', tending the house for her father. The problematic sexual connotations of such a situation were barely masked, as Temple would sing to the father 'Marry me and let me be your wife', or 'In every dream I caress you*.</p>
                <p>These sexual connotations of Temple's image were to blow up in public controversy. In his review of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wee Willie Winkie</em>(1937) for the London magazine<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Night and Day,</em>the British novelist Graham Greene (1937: 363) criticised the sensual display of the child star:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Wearing short kilts, she is a complete totsy. Watch her swaggering stride across the Indian barrack-square: hear the gasp of excited expectation from her antique audience when the sergeant's palm is raised: watch the way she measures a man with agile eyes, with dimpled depravity. Adult emotions of love and grief glissade across the mask of childhood, a childhood skin-deep.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Greene accused Temple of crudely appealing to an audience he characterised as middle-aged men and clergymen through her 'dubious coquetry* and 'well-shaped and desirable little body, packed with enormous vitality* (363). While the following libel case found against <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Night and Day,</em>with the British judge calling Greene's review 'a gross outrage', the case exposed an underside to the Temple concept that was always at least implicit in her performances.</p>
                <p>From the time she had first risen to stardom, observers had frequently speculated on how long Shirley Temple could retain her appeal as a child star. Falling box-office receipts led to her departure from Twentieth Century Fox in 1940 at the age of twelve. There followed a short period at MGM, in which her salary dropped dramatically from $9,000 to $2,500 a week (see Zierold 1965). MGM tried unsuccessfully to create projects teaming Temple with the studio's existing young stars, Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Completing only one film for MGM, Temple's teenage years were served on a seven-year contract (1943-1950) with Selznick International. David 0. Selznick appeared uncommitted to reviving Temple's career and, during the period of her contract, she was loaned out to other studios, with her final feature coming with<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Kiss for Corliss</em> (1949) for Strand Productions. Temple's association with childhood continued into adult years, appearing as the narrator of fairy tales in two television series: 'Shirley Temple's Storybook' (1958) for NBC and 'Shirley Temple Theater' (1960-1961) for ABC.</p>
                <p>While Temple's fall from popularity was almost as swift as her rise to fame, her four-year domination of the star listings represented a more consistent record than most adult stars of the period. Through the Temple image, Fox was able to produce a clear and direct vision of childhood that could be marketed across films and in secondary markets during the 1930s. Although the child star may still appear an unusual and possibly eccentric phenomenon, Temple's stardom was not a peculiar aberration of the studio system, but rather the product of the studios' ability to construct star images that could make the most direct appeal to popular sensibilities and preoccupations.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Contracts and the Control of Star Image</em></p>
                <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, stars were hired by the studios on contracts lasting for a maximum of seven years. During that period, the studio retained the exclusive option on the use of a performer's services. For performers new to the industry, a term contract with a studio offered an attractive and secure prospect. As a performer's career matured, however, the initial conditions laid out in the studios' contracts frequently proved restrictive. The term contract granted executives and producers an unprecedented level of control over the construction of a star's career and image. While contracts granted the studios the option to terminate a star's contract, the star had no legal right to break that contract (see Clark 1995). For the period of the contract, the studio had the power to determine a star's salary and control decisions over the productions and roles the performer would appear in. Contracts allowed for management to loan stars between studios and without the consent of the performer. In these arrangements, the renting studio would pay that star's salary plus an average of seventy-five per cent to the studio that held the star's contract (see Huettig 1944). The cost of hiring contracted stars from the studios was too high for most independent producers and the exchange of stars between the studios was one of the ways in which the majors collaborated to maintain their oligopoly.</p>
                <p>Studio management held the contractual power to decide which and how many roles a star would play over a year, and control of casting allowed the studios to typecast stars (see Walker 1970). By offering a series of similar roles, the studio could unify the on-screen image of a star. Any star who showed dissent over the roles he or she was offered, or else refused to be loaned to another studio, faced the threat of suspension without pay. Following suspension, a star could expect to be offered less desirable roles at a lower salary. After the recalcitrant star returned to work, the contract allowed for the period of suspension to be added at the end of the original term, lengthening the total period for which a star was owned by the studio (see Gaines 1992). An alternative way of punishing a difficult star was to lend the performer to an independent production which was predicted to be unlikely to succeed at the box office. Mae Huettig described the latter option as 'the Hollywood equivalent of Siberia' (1944: 93).</p>
                <p>Type casting created continuity across a star's on-screen image but contractual terms also extended to cover the private lives of stars in ways designed to protect against the possibilities of stars behaving in ways that threatened to bring any scandalous contradiction or discontinuity to the image. During the 1920s morality clauses were included as part of the standard personal services contract, with the effect that the private lives of stars also came under the scrutiny of the studios. As Jane Gaines suggests, the term contract offered the studios 'image insurance' (1992: 148). Stars therefore found that the term contract controlled both their onand off-screen lives.</p>
                <p>While the contracts of stars shared many common conditions, there was no uniform star contract. Individual terms could be negotiated by any star who could demonstrate his or her value to the studio. This was possible for stars who had achieved previous popularity in the theatre or at another studio. Stars who were a product of the studios' in-house talent development departments, however, faced greater difficulty negotiating better terms as they had signed their contracts before their rise to fame. Paul Muni was already well known as a stage star before he signed to Warner Bros, in the early 1930s. After making his screen debut for Howard Hughes in the independently produced<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Scarface</em>(1932), Muni was signed by Jack Warner on a one-picture deal to appear in /<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Am a Fugitive from a</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chain Gang</em>(1932). When the film was a success, Warner offered Muni a two-year, eight-picture deal, with Muni receiving a salary of $50,000 per picture. Muni's deal granted many individual concessions: the approval of story, role and script; billing as sole star; loan outs to other studios contingent on the star's consent; a fifty-fifty split with Warner Bros, on any salary average paid by the borrowing studio; definition of a year as twentyone weeks; and the right to take stage work between films (see Schatz 1988).</p>
                <p>On occasions, stars did openly contest the restrictive conditions imposed by their contracts. Amongst the most famous contract battles between a star and a studio was the fight between Bette Davis and Warner Bros. In March 1936, when the studio refused to loan her to RKO for<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mary</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">of Scotland</em>(1936), Davis delayed returning to the studio for additional work on<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Golden Arrow</em>(1936). Davis made a series of demands: a new contract for five years only; a salary rise from $100,000 to $200,000 per year; the limiting of her services to four pictures a year; star or co-star billing; and clauses granting her freedom to do one picture a year for another studio, her choice of cameraman and a three month holiday. When Jack Warner refused Davis's demands, she turned down the role offered to her in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">God's Country and the Woman</em>(1937) and was suspended without pay. She promptly departed for England to make films for Toeplitz Productions.</p>
                <p>Warner Bros, sued Davis for breach of contract, clai ming that any film produced by the British company would compete with current releases from the studio. In an English court, Davis referred to the contract as a form of slavery. Warner Bros.' barrister Sir Patrick Hastings replied: 'This slavery has a silver lining, because the slave was ... well remunerated* (quoted in Warner Sperling<em class="notranslate" translate="no">et al.</em>1994: 220). In his summary for the defence, Davis's barrister Sir William Jowett argued 'Miss Davis is a chattel in the hands of the producer. I suggest that the real essence of slavery is no less slavery because the bars are guilded' (221). According to the negative service provision in Davis's contract, the British court found in favour of Warner Bros, and the star returned to the studio. The case showed that even a star of Davis's prominence could not escape the controlling power of the term contract. Davis stayed at Warners until 1948, completing<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beyond the Forest</em>(1949) before appearing in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">All About Eve</em> (1950) for Twentieth Century Fox and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Payment on Demand</em>(1951) for RKO.</p>
                <p>The practice of extending the contracts of suspended stars ended when Olivia de Havilland took Warner Bros, to court over the length of her contract. After refusing to work on<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gay Sisters</em>(1942),<em class="notranslate" translate="no">George</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Washington Slept Here</em>(1942) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Saratoga Trunk</em>(1945), de Havilland's contract was due to expire with her performance in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Princess O'Rourke</em> (1943) and a loan to RKO for<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Government Girl</em>(1944). When Warner Bros. claimed the contract had a further six months to serve due to periods of suspension, the studio added a third feature, intending to loan the star to Columbia. De Havilland took the studio to court, and in May 1944 the Supreme Court of California ruled she did not have to work the period added for suspension as this was a debt that violated the state's antipeonage laws (see Schatz 1998). De Havilland subsequently left Warner Bros, for Paramount. The victory affected not only de Havilland's career but also questioned the whole system of hiring stars on term contracts. Many stars would remain on term contracts into the 1950s, but the de Havilland incident was a landmark case that would lead to stars wresting control of their careers from the studios and seeking greater independence.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Cagney vs. Warner Bros.</em></p>
                <p>Davis and de Havilland were not the only stars to confront Warner Bros. over their contracts. James Cagney mounted a running battle with Jack Warner over many years during his time with the studio. Following a career in musical theatre, Cagney signed to Warner Bros, in 1930, appearing in a supporting role on<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sinners' Holiday</em>(1930). After working for William Wellman in a small role on<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Other Men's Women</em>(1931), Cagney was cast by the director as second lead to Edward Wood in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Public Enemy</em> (1931). However, within days of starting rehearsals, the director had the actors exchange roles. Warner Bros, was the main producer of the gangster genre in the 1930s and in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Public Enemy</em>Cagney's portrayal of Tom Powers set an image that would stay with him throughout his years at the studio.</p>
                <p>Versions of Cagney's gangster persona appeared most famously in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Angels With Dirty Faces</em>(1938) and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Roaring Twenties</em>(1939). The popularity of Cagney's fighting gangster figure was a product of the Depression years and the immediate aftermath. Discussing the significance of the gangster hero in the context of the depression years, Nick Roddick suggests the gangster film 'showed characters responding actively and often with a strong sense of personal honour to social circumstances which, in real life, seemed to condemn their audiences to inactive frustration in the face of a "system" which often appeared d/shonourable' (1983: 99, emphasis in original). Cagney never left behind his musical background and frequently appeared in comic roles, even playing Bottom in Max Reinhardt's production of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Midsummer</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Night's Dream</em>(1935). It was most frequently the case, however, that Cagney would be cast as gangsters or, more generally, as figures outside the law.</p>
                <p>In the 1930s, Cagney and studio head Jack Warner continually engaged in battles over the star's contract. Cagney expressed his dissatisfaction with the limited roles he was cast in and attempted to re-negotiate the terms of his contract with the studio. Following the release of the comedy <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blonde Crazy</em>(1931) Cagney took the occasion of the film's quick success to enter into his first conflict with Warner Bros.' management. Cagney complained that he was underpaid compared to other stars at Warner Bros. Jack Warner had succeeded in raiding Paramount's star stable by offering high salaries to Kay Francis and William Powell. Francis was paid $3,000 a week for forty weeks-a-year and Powell received $300,000 a year for two films (see Hagopian 1986). Joe E. Brown earned $5,000 a week and Douglas Fairbanks $1,750 a week. Edward G. Robinson, the other major gangster star of the period, made $280,000 over eighteen months. Cagney demanded a rise in his salary from the standard $450 a week and, after several months of negotiations, at the end of 1931 signed a new contract for $1,400 weekly.</p>
                <p>As Cagney became Warner Bros.' major box office attraction, the star continued to request that the studio raise his salary. While a rise in 1932 took Cagney to $3,000 a week for four films a year, the star continued to protest his terms of employment. Kevin Hagopian (1986) identifies several grounds for disagreement in Cagney's dealings with Warner Bros. Cagney was dissatisfied with the directors and leading ladies employed on his films. He also resented the studio's continued casting of him in variations on the gangster type. On more economic terms, Cagney believed the studio should offer him a share in the profits of films that performed well at the box office. While not a specific complaint against Warner Bros., Cagney also found that as his salary grew, so his tax burden increased, an issue that would become significant in the star's later career. Billing became an issue when the name of co-star Pat O'Brien appeared above Cagney's on the marquee for the release of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Devil Dogs of the Air</em>(1935). Cagney argued that the billing contravened the terms of his contract. As the case progressed through the courts, Cagney took a contract with the small and short-lived Grand National studio, making two films before Warner Bros, moved to settle out of court.</p>
                <p>Cagney returned to Warner Bros, on favourable terms. According to the contract signed by Cagney in July 1939, the star was required to work a maximum of three films a year and to undertake a minimum of publicity work for the studio. The contract also gave him the option to reject a certain number of stories he was not suited to and the right to terminate his contract with five months notice. The contract gave Cagney $150,000 per picture plus ten per cent of the gross, and also required that William Cagney, the star's brother, be employed as associate producer on his films.</p>
                <p>Although the new contract granted Cagney more control over his work, he left Warner Bros, after winning an Academy Award and second New York Critics prize for his famous performance as George M. Cohan in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yankee Doodle Dandy</em>(1942). Cagney's departure was not brought on by any particular falling out with the studio but was the result of changing conditions in the industry during the early 1940s that favoured a move to independence. Potential gains for independent producers appeared imminent when, in 1940, the Justice Department began a series of actions, continuing through the decade, that ruled against the oligopolistic control of the studio system. Also, between 1940-1942, the Roosevelt administration pursued a policy of raising taxes to meet high levels of expenditure on defence, which would see the salary of high earners, including film stars, reduced to $25,000 net per annum. Independent production presented Cagney not only with control over his career but also with ways of securing income other than his salary, by means of investments and deferments. After leaving Warner Bros. Cagney signed for occasional films with Twentieth Century Fox before he and his brother formed Cagney Productions, Inc., signing an agreement in March 1942 which saw the company bankrolled as a production subsidiary of United Artists.</p>
                <p>The management of Cagney Productions was mishandled. A record of financial extravagance and arguments over publicity resulted in an output of only three films in six years, and United Artists and Cagney Productions parted ways. With his previous history, it appears surprising that on 6 May 1949 Cagney signed a new contract with Warner Bros., taking Cagney Productions with him.<em class="notranslate" translate="no">White Heat</em>(1949), Cagney's first film back at Warner Bros., returned him to the gangster type, however his power and status in the industry had changed. The new contract was non-exclusive and granted the star extensive decision-making powers together with a salary of $250,000 per picture.</p>
                <p>Back in 1932, during one of his battles with Warner Bros., Cagney walked out on the production of<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blessed Event.</em>Returning to the studio, he was cast in a production that saw him take a typical role as a conman. Originally titled<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bad Boy,</em>the film was renamed<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hard to Handle</em>(1933), the irony of which was not lost on the studio's publicity machine. Advertising heralded 'the Movies' Prodigal Son-of-a-Gun Returns' and '... All is Forgiven' (quoted in McGilligan 1975: 45). During his time at Warners Bros. during the 1930s, the casting of Cagney as the tough and fast-dealing street hoodlum seriously limited his image. At the same time, however, that image also appeared to represent the star's combative and uncompromising attitude towards the studio system.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stars as Property</em></p>
                <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, the five vertically integrated Hollywood studios dominated the domestic film industry through their control of exhibition in the United States. By their strategic ownership of theatres across the country, the majors were able to maximise their profits while blocking the entry of independent producers into the business. Stars played a vital role in the studios' control of the American film industry. Established stars offered a means for attempting to stabilise audience demand, while inside the studios, departments also fed the star system through the organised development of new star identities. A variety of methods were used to construct and promote the images of stars and the effects of star appeal were felt not only in the film business but also in other areas of the consumer economy.</p>
                <p>While powerful figures in the economics of the studio system, the professional freedom of stars was contained by contractual conditions under which they were employed by the studios. The term contract defined the relationship between the star and the studio in ways that served the economic interests of the studios first and foremost. For the duration of the contract, producers and studio executives were able to manipulate the career of the star. In certain cases, stars disputed their contractual obligations and actively resisted the use of their labour by studio management. Such was the extent of the studios' control over the domestic film market in the United States, however, that there existed no space in which to operate that was totally free of studio influence. In the studio era, stars found that they became the virtual property of the studios.</p>
