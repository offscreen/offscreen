                <p>It is, I believe, evident that a discussion of fiction and nonfiction in film cannot be separated from the theoretical debates on the question in literature, linguistics, and philosophy, which have their historic roots in antiquity and have developed significantly in the course of the last century. Indeed, the most probing work on nonfiction film in recent years relies on theoretical perspectives that come from outside film studies. Even if nonfiction in film manifests itself in specific ways, particularly because film is an audiovisual, not a literary, discourse, the larger theoretical issues are the same. A review of the critical literature is particularly relevant to examining the nonfictional character of the historical film because historians and film historians have long hesitated to give it that status. Moreover, we are, I believe, at a critical juncture: the beginning of a reexamination of traditional notions of genre that have long held back the serious study of works of nonfiction. I begin the discussion with literary theorist Gerard Genette, who has been instrumental in stirring up debate on the question.</p>
                <p>In 1991, Genette’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fiction et diction</em> launched an appeal for the study of nonfictional genres so long neglected by literary theory. In this work, Genette makes the case that the discipline of narratology has been able to ignore factual narratives by restricting its field of investigation to the “literary,” that is, the fictional genres, whether theatrical or novelistic. In so doing, it has effectively excluded from analysis the rich domain of nonfictional genres, on the basis of a difference of function. Nonfictional works are pragmatic, rather than aesthetic; they act on the reader/spectator with the intent to modify in some way his relationship to the world. The distinction goes back to Aristotle, who established the boundaries of the literary by his notions of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">légein</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">poèsis</em>. As Genette argues,“Everything takes place therefore as if Aristotle had established a divide between two functions of language: its ordinary function (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">légein</em>) to inform, interrogate, persuade, order, promise, etc., and its artistic function, which is to produce works (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">poiein</em>). The first belongs to rhetoric—today we would say, rather, pragmatics — the second to poetics.”1 Moreover,<em class="notranslate" translate="no">poèsis</em>, which designates <em class="notranslate" translate="no">production of works,</em> is tied to the creative act of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimèsis</em>, that is, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">“</em>s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">imulation</em> of imaginary actions and events.”2</p>
                <p>Literature is therefore defined by the creative act that separates the world of fiction from the world of practical experience; it is identified with the imaginative and the fictitious. The literary marks out its territory — the epic (or novelistic) and dramatic genres—and sets itself off from the whole field of pragmatic discourses. As Genette puts it, “To enter fiction is to leave the ordinary field of the exercise of language, marked by the concerns of truth or persuasion that command the rules of communication and the deontology of discourse.”3 Kate Hamburger, the most persuasive of the neo-Aristotelians, argues that the exclusion of factual discourses from the sphere of the literary can be justified on the basis of semiological differences between fictional and factual narratives. Factual discourses make use of a specific system of enunciation. They set in place a communicative relationship between the discursive partners: the“real” enunciating subject, the author of the text, speaks directly to the reader. The mimetic genres, by contrast, eschew the pragmatics of ordinary language and make use of“language as a material and instrument, like the painter with colors and the sculptor with stone.”4</p>
                <p>Thus, the bias of the Aristotelian and neo-Aristotelian classifications dismisses a vast field of literary production: all the works that belong to the class of discourses called nonfiction even if they possess undeniable aesthetic qualities.“Modern” aestheticism, in the domain of art history as in literary theory, tends to polarize works according to the criterion of utility. Roman Jakobson, for example, valorizes the literary object by giving it an aesthetic character in which the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">poetic function</em> eradicates any pragmatic function.5 The authentically poetic object is removed from the active sphere of the lived experience of the reader and refuses the entire referential dimension of language. Jakobson is very much in agreement with Panofsky, who cites Poussin on modern aesthetics in the visual arts:“La fin de l’art est la delectation.”6</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Th eories of&nbsp;Fiction, Th eories of&nbsp;Nonfiction</strong></p>
                <p>How is literary theory to deal with those vast domains of factual narratives: histories, biographies and autobiographies, travel narratives, ethnographies, and accounts of judicial proceedings, to cite obvious examples? Some theorists have responded by retaining the aesthetic criterion and annexing certain factual texts to the domain of the literary. Genette observes that this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">conditionalist aesthetics</em>, since it is based on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pleasure of the text</em> rather than on theoretical distinctions, makes the reader the arbiter of aesthetic value:“I consider as literary any text that produces in me an aesthetic satisfaction.”7 In the conditionalist perspective, poetics embraces the factual narrative on condition that the reader pay attention to the work’s formal and stylistic features and turn a deaf ear to its communicative function. As Genette points out, the sense of beauty the reader finds in a factual narrative is related to the historic process of loss and gain between the utility of a factual narrative and its aesthetic value. The passage of time tends to lessen the urgency of a didactic or polemical communication, thus augmenting whatever literary qualities the text may possess: “The fact remains that, over the centuries, we see the field of conditional literariness ceaselessly extending itself because of the apparently constant, or perhaps accelerating, tendency to aesthetic salvaging… which credits to art a great part of what the action of time takes away from the credits of truth or utility.”8</p>
                <p>But is it legitimate to designate aesthetics as the sole criterion of literariness? Should we allow the subjective assessment of even the most discerning reader to remove from the literary field all works it judges unworthy of consideration? Conditional aesthetics has had the advantage of breaking up the rigid generic categories that theory imposes on literature. But is it possible to substitute aesthetic judgment for properly theoretical distinctions? Genette does not think so, and to support his case he appeals to common sense:“The worst painting, the worst sonata, the worst sonnet remain painting, music, or poetry for the simple reason that they can not be anything else.”9</p>
                <p>To sum up Genette ’s analysis, the distinctions that have been drawn between legitimate and illegitimate genres have served to exclude factual discourse from the field of literary study: the pragmatic function obviates the aesthetic function. The conditionalist model, while reestablishing the legitimacy of individual nonfictional works, imposes subjective judgment as the sole criterion of art and neglects the significant feature, whether fictionality or poetics, that defines a literary work. In neither case does the factual narrative have the right to literary status by the specific character of its discourse. In reaction against these two exclusionist models, Genette abandons the aesthetic and mimetic criteria and proposes a simple inclusive model of literary genres. On the one hand, he retains two traditional classes of literary practice: fiction and poetry. On the other hand, he adds a third class of literary practice: the nonfictional discourses that he names <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diction</em>. Finally, Genette takes aim at his own discipline, narratology, which has not been wise enough to recognize its failures of vision and has taken up an elitist position on factual narratives:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Now, obviously, the two branches of narratology have, up till now, dedicated their almost exclusive attention to the behaviors and objects of fictional narrative alone; and it did so, not out of a simple empirical choice that would not prejudice in any way aspects that were momentarily and explicitly neglected, but rather by dint of an implicit privilege that hypostatizes fictional narrative into narrative <em class="notranslate" translate="no">par excellence</em>, or into the model for all narratives. … At the stage we are at now, whatever may be the merits and defects of fictional narratology, it is doubtful that it can spare us from a specific study of factual narratives. It is certain in any case that narratology cannot indefinitely dispense with an investigation of the applicability of its results, and even its methods, to a domain that it has never really explored before annexing it silently, without study or justification.10</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I think it is reasonable to retain certain aspects of the Aristotelian logic. Fiction and nonfiction can be distinguished by their differing functions. Nonfictional genres can be defined by their pragmatism and fiction by its creation of a space where the concerns of the world of real action are suspended in the interest of another kind of experience. It is less clear that fictional narratives can be differentiated from factual ones on the basis of a notion of mimesis that restricts imitation to the creation of imaginary events. The root of the word <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fiction</em> in the Latin <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fingere</em> suggests that fictional narratives are <em class="notranslate" translate="no">shaped</em>, whereas nonfictional narratives are bound by the truth imperative that prohibits such structuring activity. However, as many contemporary theorists contend, it seems much more likely that the narration of imaginary and of real events have much in common. Indeed, Paul Ricoeur in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Time and</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative</em> devotes considerable space to showing that historical narratives operate according to semiological principles similar to those that govern fictional narratives and that their difference, the moment of their “bifurcation,” must be situated elsewhere.</p>
                <p>It is important, however, not to rush to adopt one position or another. The theoretical debate on how to distinguish fiction from nonfiction has been probing and thought provoking, and the major issues are far from settled. In this chapter, I propose reviewing how literary theory has attempted to explain the difference between fictional and factual narratives, and my discussion focuses on a number of key texts: Kate Hamburger ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Logic of Literature</em>; John Searle’s “The Logical Status of Fictional Discourse”; Gerard Genette’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fiction et diction</em>; Octave Mannoni ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Clefs pour l’imaginaire</em>; Jean-Marie Schaeffer ’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pourquoi la</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fiction?</em>; and Ann Rigney’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rhetoric of Historical Representation</em>.</p>
                <p>Kate Hamburger bases her notion of fiction on an analysis of the use of grammatical tenses. The very condition of fiction assumes that the imagined time of fictional events is disconnected from the real time of the author ’s writing. Although literary critics of a certain persuasion go to great lengths to reestablish links between the lived experience of novelists and the world of their novels, fiction posits, as the condition of its discourse, its autonomy from such relationships. In the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">discursive</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">time</em> of nonfiction, on the other hand, the system of tenses is based on  “the present or the present moment of the speaking subject. ”11 The past or the future has meaning only in relation to the moment of enunciation, and for these tenses to belong to the order of the real, they must be emitted by a real subject, a speaker who assumes responsibility for the words he speaks.</p>
                <p>Hamburger calls this subject the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I-Origo</em>, which she conceives as the originating point occupied by an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I</em> in the here-and-now of discourse. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I-Origo</em> is less marked in historical narration since the historian is intent on recounting the past rather than present circumstances. However, the historian still takes up a position in time from which the past is constituted: “The possibility of the question as to the When of an occurrence proves the reality of the occurrence, and the question itself proves the presence of an<em class="notranslate" translate="no">I-Origo</em>, be this implicit or explicit. ”12 By the same logic, in a fictional narrative the preterit loses“its grammatical function of designating what has passed” because the narrator is not an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I-Origo</em>  —is not the real author—and therefore the past has no discursive frame of reference. The narrator becomes, rather, an imaginary agent that is the product of the logic of fiction:“What is narrated is referred not to a real <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I-Origo</em>, but to fictive I-Origines and is therefore fictive itself. ”13</p>
                <p>Moreover, in a fictional text, dates or past tenses do not refer to actual moments in their pastness but to the plane of the“present” of narration that stands outside any real reference in time:“We can no longer pose the question as to When, not even when perchance a date is named, for instance: summer, 1890. With or without any date’s being given, I learn from this, as a sentence occurring in a novel, not that Mr. X <em class="notranslate" translate="no">was</em> on a trip, but that he <em class="notranslate" translate="no">is</em> on a trip.”14 The reader does not acknowledge the preterit as a sign of pastness; it becomes something like the canvas that the observer ignores in studying the painting. The power of fiction consists in its ability to recount events that can be imagined as presently occurring. As Hamburger points out, fictive statements lose the validity of“logico-grammatical laws.” Deictic or indexical signs (this/that, I/you, today/tomorrow) do not refer to the originating subject and the context of discourse but to the closed world of the fiction ’s diegesis. Adverbs of time, for example, can take on a paradoxical character in fictional texts, that is, seem to be in conflict with the pastness expressed by the tense of a verb:“ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Today</em> he avoided the streets he had frequented only <em class="notranslate" translate="no">yesterday</em>.”</p>
                <p>The distinctions Hamburger draws between fictional and pragmatic discourses are not all based on the relationship between the tenses and the enunciative act but also concern the position the narrator adopts in relation to the characters. In narrative, Hamburger argues, there are two kinds of action, which she distinguishes as“verbs of external action ” and “verbs of internal action.” Verbs of external action designate behavior that can be observed and are thus limited to the words, actions, and appearance of characters. Literary theory refers to this position of narration as external focalization. Behaviorist observation of character can be a feature of both fictional and factual narratives: the narrator’s position obeys the same constraints of perspective whether the observations he makes are real or imagined. Verbs of internal action emanate from the consciousness of the individual character and represent mental and emotional states, the development of thought or intentions, or the internal activation of memory or fantasy. These verbs of inner action provide the reader with signs of a character’s subjectivity through the power the narrator conventionally exercises in penetrating into the workings of another mind. The subject of verbs of inner action is in the third person: he or she thought, felt, imagined, or remembered.</p>
                <p>Hamburger makes of this access to the character’s inner world a defining feature of novelistic fiction:“Epic fiction [the novel] is the sole epistemological instance where the I-Originarity (or subjectivity) of a third person qua third person can be portrayed.”15 For Hamburger,  “reality statements” are subject to the constraint of direct observation by the speaking subject (as opposed to the feigned observation of the fictional narrator). The historical character may be the subject of the narrative ’s action, but as readers we are not privy to his inner states of mind: he cannot be “portrayed in the subjectivity, in the I-Originarity of his inner, mental processes, of his‘existence.’”16 Memory, for example, is an internal psychological process that binds together past and present experience:“For in personal memory vivid mental representation falls together with the feeling of the Then, of the Before, and when this image is reproduced from memory it in turn coincides with the temporal Now of the act of remembering and re-living.”17 Such subjective processes belong to the domain of fictional narrative alone since the historical observer has no access to the living mind of the character. Autobiography is the only nonfictional genre that authorizes the use of verbs of inner action since the narrator is the protagonist of his own story: only autobiographical texts—one could add all discourses that focus on the subjectivity of the speaking subject, including those of historical witnesses—can legitimately evoke nonobservable phenomena while remaining in the sphere of reality statements.</p>
                <p>Another defining feature of fiction is that it creates an illusion of real existence, which Hamburger sees as the essence of Aristotle’s mimesis. The novel and theater are able to produce a semblance of life because the author of a fiction is freed from the constraints of the reality statement, based on documented observation, and empowered to represent life in all its perceptual detail. Such a semblance cannot be produced in historical narrative because what is past is, by definition, what can no longer be perceived. The historian does not narrate as if he could “see” the perceptual field of events; rather, he deciphers clues and interprets evidence. Any attempt to render actions as if they were present to the reader belongs to fiction. Thus, all detailed description of daily life and situations attached to presumably historical figures is fictional. Likewise, dialogues presented <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in extenso</em> and the fluctuation between inner and outer speech of characters belong to fiction. Once the reader accepts the conceit of the invented character, every aspect of narrative is overtaken by fiction. In Hamburger’s radical view, the fictional frame contaminates everything. Dated and verifiable historical information becomes part of the“play” of fiction in which reality statements are feigned like everything else. The laws of fiction“are so powerful that they can never be suspended or rendered ineffective ‘in earnest, ’ but only‘in play,’ and this means not at all. Non-reality, once it is constituted through the fictive persons, cannot admit reality into any area within its realm. That is, non-reality cannot assimilate a real I-Origo and thereby become its genuine field of experience.”18</p>
                <p>Hamburger ’s analysis is exceptionally rigorous, resolutely establishing lines of demarcation between fictional and factual narratives. The question remains: are these lines as absolute as Hamburger maintains? As we will see, other theorists are not so convinced.</p>
                <p>John Searle examines the difference between discourses of fiction and nonfiction from another perspective. His approach consists in asking, what is the nature of the speech act that writers engage in when they make statements that are clearly intended to be understood as imaginary? How are these assertions different from those that are intended to have a direct impact on the reader’s real experience?</p>
                <p>Searle begins with the observation that fictional assertions resemble assertions in the world of ordinary language, that is, in the pragmatic situations of discourse. There is no way to distinguish on a semantic basis, for example, the statements a journalist makes in reporting events and situations from quite similar statements that occur in a piece of naturalistic fiction. Both include direct observations of the social world and descriptions of a recognizable physical environment. The difference lies, Searle argues, in the nature of the speech act involved in the two cases. In nonfiction, the author performs an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">illocutionary</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">act</em>: he is serious about the statements he makes and therefore commits himself to a serious relationship with the reader. Searle contends, in much the same vein as Hamburger, that real discourse is subject to the rules of pragmatics, which govern the use of language for the purpose of acting on one’s interlocutor. To persuade his reader, the author “commits himself to the truth of the expressed proposition ” and avers his ability to justify it through reasoned argument or evidence. Fictional statements, on the other hand, lack precisely this commitment to the truth of a statement and to the world of the reader. When a novelist asserts the existence of a character or represents a character ’s action, he does not vouch for the“reality” of the character or action, even if the character or action is based on a model known to the novelist through real experience. Fictional statements, Searle argues, are  “pretended” assertions; they mimic the form of the assertion without meeting its conditions—the commitment to “truth” that the speaker assumes in addressing his interlocutor.</p>
                <p>Pretense in fiction is not, however,“a form of deception ”19; pretended assertions in fiction are not lies. Novelists do not attempt to fool the reader into taking the imaginary for the real. Rather, fiction offers what Searle calls a“nondeceptive pseudoperformance ” that gives the reader representations clearly marked by the hypothetical act: the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">as if</em> that suspends“the normal operation of rules relating illocutionary acts and the world. ”20 Searle invites us to conceive of rules of discourse as “rules correlating words (or sentences) to the world. Think of them as vertical rules that establish connections between language and reality. Now what makes fiction possible, I suggest, is a set of extralinguistic, nonsemantic conventions that break the connection between words and the world established by the rules mentioned earlier.”21 It is as if the author “goes through the motions” of making assertions while all the time knowing they are not true. He pretends to refer to a world that does not preexist his discourse but is the product of it.</p>
                <p>By situating the defining moment of fiction in the nature of the speech act —outside questions of textual content or form —Searle avoids some of the pitfalls of Hamburger’s position. He is able to acknowledge, for example, that there are factual representations that aim to restitute events in their full perceptual detail. Documentary film, for example, derives its power from the specificity with which it renders observed reality. Many journalistic stories are accounts of real situations and events in their physical, social, and psychological detail. In literature, there are increasing numbers of factual narratives—on the model of Truman Capote’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">In Cold Blood</em> or Norman Mailer ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hangman’s</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Song</em> —that attempt to uncover the subjective side of factual events. Indeed, many contemporary theorists argue that history is not the simple narration of events but the discovery of intentions—the subjectivity without which historians cannot explain why social groups or individuals take the actions they do on the scene of history. For Searle, the basis of fiction is the contractual relationship between writer and reader, filmmaker and spectator, that sets the represented world apart from the world of experience.</p>
                <p>Gerard Genette agrees with Searle that fiction and nonfiction can be distinguished on the basis of the author’s relationship to his readership, but his argument develops around the three narrative“actors”: the author, the narrator, and the character. In fiction, the author is not the narrator (even if he presents himself as such), nor is he the character (even if he presents himself as such). In homodiegetic fiction, the author is not the narrator, but the narrator is one of the characters. In heterodiegetic fiction, the author is not the narrator, and the narrator is not one of the characters. In factual narratives, on the other hand, the author and the narrator are one and the same. In autobiography, for example, Genette proposes the formula A = N = C, in which all three entities are assumed to be the same person who authors, narrates, and acts.</p>
                <p>The formulation that Genette proposes for historical narration is the following: the author is the narrator, but the author/narrator is not the character (A = N ≠ C). The key to the distinction between fictional and factual discourses lies in Searle’s notion of the responsibility or irresponsibility of the author in relation to his text. If the author is not the narrator, he takes his distance from his discourse and is not answerable for its truthfulness or seriousness. If the author is the narrator, he can be held accountable and may be judged in the legal sense (for example, cases of slander) or in the court of his peers (critical review of historical literature). Genette summarizes the relationship between author and narrator in fictional and factual discourses in the following terms:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>It seems to me that their rigorous identity (A = N), to the extent that it can be established, defines factual narrative—the discourse in which, to use Searle’s terms, the author assumes full responsibility for the assertions of his narrative, and consequently grants no autonomy to any other narrator. Conversely, their dissociation (A doesn’t equal N) defines fiction, that is, a type of narrative for which the author doesn’t seriously assume responsibility for truthfulness.22</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Genette argues therefore for the excision of N as a“useful category” in the description of factual discourses.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to examine how this understanding of the fictional speech act finds its rather precise echo in the work of psychoanalyst Octave Mannoni in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Clefs pour l’imaginaire ou l’Autre Scène</em>. For Mannoni, the key to the imaginary—that is, access to the psychological state engendered by imaginary acts—is the splitting of belief that Freud designated as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Verleugnung</em>. Disavowal in the Freudian sense is not denial —the refusal to acknowledge real situations. It consists, rather, in a division of the ego into two separate and contradictory agents: one part of the ego retains its relationship with the real, while the other allows itself to indulge in imaginary representations. The statement of disavowal that Mannoni offers is one he heard repeatedly in his analytic practice: “Je sais bien, mais quand meme” (“Of course I know, but all the same ”). In his classic example, Mannoni attributes the “belief” of the young Hopi in the“reality” of the kachina to the desire to experience ritual as an illusion. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I know very well</em> that the kachina are my uncles and kinsmen, but<em class="notranslate" translate="no">all the same</em> what emotions I feel in pretending they are not. The real aspect of the ego (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">I know …</em>) protects the imaginary aspect, which <em class="notranslate" translate="no">all the same</em> takes its pleasure.23</p>
                <p>In a brilliant essay on theatrical illusion, Mannoni analyzes the way in which the spectator’s belief in theatrical representations is constructed by means of specific institutional defenses. Entering the theater (or the cinema or picking up a piece of fiction) is the equivalent of entering into a contractual situation. The spectator/reader is always aware that what he will experience is imaginary, that the theatrical sets, the actors, the dialogue are not real but“pretended”: they only resemble real places, real agents of action, real interlocutory exchanges:  “As long as the scene presents itself as a place other than what it really is, as long as the actor presents himself as someone else, a perspective of the imaginary will be created.”24 The disabused spectator engages in an act of collusion with the apparatus of spectacle that presupposes that he is well versed in the conventions without which spectacle could not exist. He identifies with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">magister ludi</em> of the theatrical game, the “great image maker” in film, the author in fiction, who set down the conditions and orchestrate the unfolding of the imaginary world. He embodies the ego ’s defense against the eruption of the imaginary into life. Meanwhile, the liberated half of the ego enjoys the pleasures of identification with characters and actions:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>When the curtain rises, it is the imaginary powers of the Ego that are at once liberated and organized—dominated—by the spectacle. It ’s hard to know how to put it, because metaphorically the word <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</em> has become the term that designates the psychic location where the images exhibit themselves. One can say that the theatrical scene becomes the extension of the Ego with all its possibilities.25</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Although Mannoni does not speak about nonfictional narratives, it is clear that the contractual situation that sets up the conditions of fictional  “pretense” does not operate in nonfiction. Rather, the reader/ spectator is given to understand that the persons and actions represented in discourse belong to the shared world of author and reader. I have argued elsewhere that in documentary film the contract of spectacle is nullified. The spectator is not protected against the incursion of the “real” into the situation of spectacle, and that he therefore adopts a  “vigilant” stance in relation to the film.26</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pourquoi la fiction?</em> Jean-Marie Schaeffer also argues that the distinction between fiction and nonfiction is essentially pragmatic. It is not enough for the author to intend a work as fictional or factual; the reader/spectator must recognize the intention. The identifying signs of the fictional or the factual can be quite weak in the text itself: as Searle suggests, there is no narrative focalization or authorial style that distinguishes the factual from the fictional. The reader, whom Schaeffer characterizes as inclined to credulity, depends on markers that Schaeffer calls <em class="notranslate" translate="no">paratextual</em>. The simplest form of the paratextual mark of fictionality is the notation“a novel” that often follows the title of the work or the prenarrative titles of a film that acknowledge actors, set designers, and so forth. However, many subtler markers exist, for example, the place of a given text within the output of a noted novelist, historian, or filmmaker.</p>
                <p>Schaeffer is particularly concerned with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cas-limites</em>, extreme cases of works in which the reader or spectator might confuse the imagined and the real. His position does not take account of markers that are in fact properly textual, in particular the conventions of genre that immediately assign a gothic romance (often nearly parodied by the image on the book ’s cover) or a science fiction film to the realm of fiction. It is indeed difficult to conceive of a work of serious nonfiction that would seem to adopt the conventions of genre that belong to popular fiction or film. That said, Schaeffer is quite correct in asserting, following Searle, that the attitude the reader adopts in relation to a work is based in the intersubjective agreement by means of which the writer makes his intention known and the reader acknowledges it. In fiction, Searle observes, the contract is negotiated through <em class="notranslate" translate="no">shared dissimulation </em>: the writer and the reader agree to engage in representing a world as if it were real when they know it is not.</p>
                <p>Schaeffer develops Searle’s argument by contesting what he terms the semantic position. This position holds that the essential difference between fiction and nonfiction is a question of their reference or lack of reference to the real world: a factual discourse can be verified and is therefore referential; fictional representations are not open to verification and are therefore not referential. According to this position, fiction, in contrast to nonfiction, is characterized by propositions that only pretend to refer to an existing world, and because actors, objects, descriptions, and actions in fiction are only imagined, their denotation is illusory and vacant. Schaeffer disputes the centrality of the question of verifiability. He argues that the distinguishing feature of statements of fact (propositions we are asked to believe, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">whether true</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">or false</em>) is that they are based on the reality principle, lay claim to truth, and solicit action or reaction in pragmatic terms, whereas fictions are imaginative constructs that escape from the reality principle and therefore exist outside questions of truth and falsehood. Playful dissimulation relies on disengaging representation from cognitive and practical interaction with the world. Fictional representations do not call on us to act.</p>
                <p>This does not mean, Schaeffer continues, that pragmatic and imaginative discourses have different modes of representation. On the contrary, he argues that both fiction and nonfiction use the same general “posture of representation”:“All representation possesses a structure of reference in the logical meaning of the term, that is, it is  ‘about something,’ it‘bears on something.’”27 The nature of representation does not change according to whether the world it models is real or imaginary. Fiction, like nonfiction, has the same classes of referents: the environmental context, the action of characters, and their physical and mental states. Although fiction refers to situations, characters, and objects that do not have their counterparts in a specific, lived reality, these imagined elements cannot be represented as nonexistent because representation always posits representational content. Indeed, the very existence of fictional texts that imitate nonfictional genres demonstrates the extent to which it is impossible to establish distinct boundaries. Hildesheimer’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marbot, Eine Biographie</em>, which Schaeffer analyzes at length —a“false” biography in which the paratextual markers of fiction are hidden in order to exploit the reader’s credulity—or the “false” documentary film that withholds paratextual markers of fictionality until the final credits, are certainly extreme cases, but they do make the point that fiction and nonfiction cannot always be distinguished in terms of their representations.</p>
                <p>We must therefore abandon the notion, concludes Schaeffer, that there are “two modalities of representation, one fictional, the other referential. There is only one: the referential mode.”28 Indeed, the internal organization of discourse varies relatively little according to whether what is represented is real or imagined; it varies dramatically according to the “vehicle of representation” the discourse puts in service: oral or written language, audiovisual“languages,” and so on. Moreover, Schaeffer rejects Hamburger’s basic notion that the novel is the only literary form that is authorized to give an account of the internal life of a character in the third person:“Factual narratives also have always put into use elements of internal focalization, and for the very general reason that, as soon as we interpret the behavior of an entity in an anthropomorphic perspective, we cannot but attribute to him mental states, and therefore‘see’ him from the inside. ”29</p>
                <p>The great strength of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pourquoi la fiction?</em> is that it reexamines fiction (and by implication, nonfiction) in the light of theoretical work in several disciplines, notably philosophy, linguistics, biology, sociology, narratology, and aesthetics, and draws on a broad range of works from European and American perspectives. Through a process of analysis and evaluation, Schaeffer clears his way through the thorny controversies that have made the idea of mimesis problematic in the theoretical literature, with the clear intention of defending imitation as a central notion in narrative theory. It is useful to the study of historical narratives to retain Schaeffer’s definitions. The type of imitation that concerns us is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimesis as representation</em>, which Schaeffer defines as the “production of a mental or symbolic model based on an isomorphic relation to the reality to be known, therefore by virtue of a resemblance (direct or indirect) between the two.”30 With written or filmed narratives, we are dealing with symbolic models, as opposed to private mental representations such as fantasy or dream. These are representations in the public sphere,“publicly accessible, invented by man as means of representation.”31 Schaeffer refers here to the “semiotic apparatuses”— linguistic or audiovisual representations that can be shared by social groups, in our case written and cinematic narratives.</p>
                <p>All forms of mimesis rely on resemblance: the representation imitates the thing to which it refers. However, the similarity is always relative because it is the result of“selective attention.” In the act of representation, we “privilege” specific properties of the thing we are representing. This process of discrimination—including specific aspects while excluding others —is basic to human cognitive processes that structure the world in terms of similarities and differences. Moreover, Schaeffer insists on the active character of mimesis: representation constructs resemblances that “didn’t exist in the world before the mimetic act and whose existence is caused by this act.”32 He calls each element of similarity a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimème</em>. Each <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimème</em> is a cognitive tool that provides knowledge of the thing we are imitating; it constructs a model of the thing:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Imitation is never a (passive) reflection of the imitated thing, but the construction of a model of this thing, a model based on a selective grid of similarities between the imitation and what it imitates. … We discover here… a new example of the fact that the relationship between representation and reality is interactive: although the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimème</em> is constrained by the properties of what is being imitated, it is only through its construction that we discover the properties of the object that constrain it.33</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>We find in Schaeffer one explanation for the tendency in the social sciences to shy away from associating the work of the historian with representation. Mimesis, Schaeffer argues, is a means to acquire knowledge, but philosophical rationalism has never legitimized it. Apprenticeship, for example, is relegated to the sphere of simple skill acquisition largely because it does not depend on rational thought. And yet the greater part of human learning depends on the social process of imitation, often divorced from rational examination. Imitation requires the learner to internalize knowledge through immersion, en bloc, without subjecting it to critical analysis. Indeed, the historian’s work doubtless convinces the reader as much by the strength of its narrative coherence as by the signs of erudition or critical method. Immersion requires us to perform the act of mimetic modeling, and  “it does this by leading us to adopt (to a certain point) the attitude (the mental, representational, perceptive or actantial disposition) that would be ours if we were really in the situation for which the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimèmes</em> construct the semblance.”34 There are without doubt degrees of difference between immersion in a fictional, as opposed to a historical, model, and doubtless the differences have to do with the maintenance of a certain critical distance. However, Schaeffer tells us, the basic process of representation is the same. The author and the reader (or the filmmaker and the spectator) together construct a discursive world that is meaningful to the extent that it emulates the coherence of the world and allows them to immerse themselves in it.</p>
                <p>What distinguishes fictional and nonfictional models is, Schaeffer argues, nonfiction ’s cognitive constraints. In historical narrative, for example, the mimetic-homological model, which Schaeffer ascribes to nonfiction, obeys the law of historical fact:“It must maintain local structural equivalencies.” In other words, the elements of narrative representation — <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimèmes</em>—are bound in a relationship with the factsin- the-world, a relation we would call motivated. When <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimèmes</em> construct a correspondence between discourse and the world, they do so within the constraints of the real, in the case of history, the constraint of what has really taken place. Fiction also offers mimetic models—an imitation of the world—but they are not bound by structural homology. Rather, fiction establishes a relationship of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">analogy</em> with the world of lived experience, a relationship that is weaker and not defined by direct structural correspondence. In Schaeffer’s words,“A fictional modeling is de facto always a modeling of the real world. Indeed, our representational competencies are those of the representation of the reality we are a part of, because they have been selected by this reality itself in a process of permanent interaction.”35 If nonfiction is bound by its truth function, fiction obeys the principle of its own internal coherence.</p>
                <p>Schaeffer ’s analysis is crucial to understanding the work of representation that lies at the base of all narrative. He asserts the primacy, in chronological terms, of the act of representation. It comes <em class="notranslate" translate="no">before</em> we consider whether a representation is a“truthful” account of events in the world of lived experience. Therefore, it is not possible, Schaeffer concludes, to posit one mode of representation for factual narratives and another, separate mode for fictional narratives:“Before the question of truth, and, a fortiori, the question of referential truth in the logical meaning of the term, comes into play, representation has already posited the object (to which it refers) <em class="notranslate" translate="no">as</em> represented object. This structure is common to all representations.”36 Thus, the reader/ spectator performs the same operations of representation that a text induces in him, whether the text is fictional or nonfictional.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Th e Practice of&nbsp;Nonfiction</strong></p>
                <p>The theoretical positions proposed by Hamburger, Searle, Genette, Mannoni, and Schaeffer establish through philosophical argument the boundaries that define different types of discourses or literary genres. However, what happens when we put theory to the test through an examination of actual texts? Do we find that fiction and nonfiction sort themselves out according to the demarcations that theory proposes? Schaeffer ’s insistence on the textual similarities between works of fiction and nonfiction and the importance of paratextual markers as the primary means of differentiation suggests the potential ambiguity of texts. Searle contends, for his part, that certain fictional genres make “nonfictional commitments”; in naturalistic fiction, for example, the author may indeed represent real places or events that have as much “truth value” as observation in nonfictional genres. There is, Searle argues, a kind of contract between author and reader that creates  “understandings about how far the horizontal conventions of fiction break the vertical connections of serious speech.”37</p>
                <p>Genette goes even further in raising doubts about the power of the fictional speech act to cast all utterances in the imaginary mode. As he observes, fictional discourses are not exclusively made up of statements that are confined to the world that fiction creates. The diegetic world is not an autonomous construct with its own internal rules; indeed, the fictional world and the real world are at many moments inextricably linked. A fictional narrator—who, we suspect, is at such moments much closer to the real author—is quite capable of seriously commenting on the extratextual world, even if his remarks serve the interest of the development of the fiction. Genette argues that the novelist can “introduce islets of nonfiction or uncertainty into the text of a fiction. ”38</p>
                <p>The “serious” historical novel, I would argue, is a prime example of this admixture of fiction and nonfiction. Stendhal’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Red and the</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Black</em> is dense with sometimes specific, sometimes veiled references to contemporary and historical realities, and many of these real references are not incidental “history effects” but become pivotal to the development of plot. Moreover, annotated editions of the work go to great lengths to clarify or reveal links between the world of fiction and historical and biographical realities. Similarly, a novel like Henry Roth ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">From Bondage</em> creates uncertainty in the reader. Despite the paratextual statement,“This novel is certainly not an autobiography, nor should it be taken as such,” the reader is confronted by unsettling parallels between the fictional characters it describes and events it recounts and aspects of the author’s own life. Even in less “referential” works of fiction, statements of fact abound; although they belong to the narrated world of fiction, they still retain their verifiability: “It is the same with the countless statements of the historic or geographical type whose insertion in a fictional context and subordination to fictional ends don ’t necessarily deprive them of their truth value. ” Genette suggests that the “‘discourse of fiction’ is in fact a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">patchwork</em>, or a more or less homogenized amalgam of dissimilar elements borrowed for the most part from reality.” Indeed, Genette argues, there is never anything that is purely imaginary in fiction:“It is doubtless the same for fiction as discourse as for fiction as an entity, or as an image: the whole is more fictive than any of its parts.”39</p>
                <p>There is, Genette argues, a dearth of systematic analyses of nonfictional texts and a vast inquiry is needed to arrive at an understanding of the<em class="notranslate" translate="no">practice</em>of nonfiction. One of the strengths of Genette’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fiction</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">et diction</em> is that it sets out to consider what might be the peculiarities, the specificities of factual texts on the basis of categories of narrative analysis he developed for fictional texts:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I would like … to examine the reasons factual and fictional narrative might have to behave differently in relation to the story they “recount,” by dint of the fact that this story is in the one case (supposed to be)“truthful,” and in the other fictive, that is, invented by the person who presently is telling it, or by some other from whom he inherits it.40</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Genette places particular emphasis on four narrative categories he previously identified and described in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative Discourse</em>: the order in which events are recounted; the speed with which events are told; the mode of narration; and the signs of the narrator’s voice.</p>
                <p>There is no reason to believe, Genette argues, that fiction and nonfiction can be distinguished in terms of narrative <em class="notranslate" translate="no">order</em>. Indeed, nothing constrains the factual narrator to a simple linear chronology of events. Like the fictional narrator, he may make use of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">analepses</em>, flashing back to moments in the past, or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">prolepses</em>, flashing forward to moments in the future, with respect to the present time of the narrative. Indeed, historical narrative often needs to show relationships between different historical moments. It is a principle of method, as we saw, that the historian begins by describing a culminating event or situation and turns back in time to recount the actions and circumstances that led to the result. Or, in the process of describing a developing situation, it is quite common for the historian to flash forward to the situation’s outcome, or the historian may move quickly from the intention of a social group or historical figure to the resulting realization or failure of the initiative. It is therefore not surprising that historical narratives move easily between moments in time. Indeed, historical narration makes, I would contend, more frequent use of analepses and prolepses than is characteristic of fiction. To take another example, autobiographical narratives retain all the flexibility of an authorial consciousness that  “knows” the relationship between events and can negotiate meaningfully between moments in the past.</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">speed</em> of narrative can be described as the relationship between the duration of the events the narrator is recounting and the amount of time he takes in narrating them. The narrator gives more time and more detail to moments of greater importance and skips quickly across those he judges peripheral. Genette observes that varying speeds of narration are characteristic of factual as well as fictional narratives and operate for the same reasons. Important events, whether actual or imagined, are treated more slowly and in more detail and are hence more vivid than secondary incidents; they are set in relief by the text. However, is it possible for historical narratives to achieve the kind of vivid richness prevalent in fiction? Genette agrees with Hamburger that finely detailed scenes and extensive dialogue are characteristic of fictional narratives. Not that such scenes are impossible in nonfiction — particularly, one could argue in autobiography. However, in history the critique of method always raises the question,“How do you know? ” As we have seen, the historian may only recount what he can know or infer.</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mode</em> of a narrative has to do with the distance the narrator takes from the narrative information he is communicating. A narrative may be given in the mode of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">telling</em>, in which the narrator’s voice mediates the account of events and therefore takes a relatively more distant stance with respect to the action. In the mode of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">showing</em>, the narrator allows the actors and actions to“speak for themselves, ” and events are represented in greater detail and duration. The narrator thus allows a more direct relationship between reader and narrative than is characteristic of a telling. The mode of a narrative can also vary according to how it is focalized: internal focalization, when the account is mediated by the subjectivity of a character, and external focalization, when the account is limited to observation of a character’s behavior. Genette argues that all signs of internal subjectivity in factual narrative raise again the question,“How do you know?” It is possible to obtain direct introspective information in historical narratives only if the archives provide it in the form of diaries or other personal accounts. Factual narratives can in general be characterized by a narration that is relatively distant and externally focalized. In fiction,“the author <em class="notranslate" translate="no">imagines</em> thoughts [of characters] as he pretends to report them: you only perceive for sure what you <em class="notranslate" translate="no">invent.”</em> 41 In principle, the historical narrator ’s imagination submits to limits: human thought in the internal, psychological sense can only be the result of a cautious analysis of information. In practice, however, the situation seems less pure. If historians avoid lengthy descriptions of the internal thought processes of historical actors —one of the defining features of the historical novel —they quite routinely attribute to individual and collective figures the language of human intentionality and even state of mind.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voice</em> in a narrative text concerns the narrating agency itself and  “the traces it has left—or has presumably left —in the narrative discourse it has presumably produced.”42 The narrator cannot avoid situating the act of narration in time in relation to the events he recounts: he narrates actions that have already happened, that will happen in the future, or that are happening at the moment of the telling, or the narration is intercalated, that is, it shifts between narrative agents, as in the epistolary novel. The narrative voice is also characterized by <em class="notranslate" translate="no">level</em>. The narrator may stand outside the diegetic world he recounts and therefore be termed extradiegetic. A narrator may be intradiegetic in that he inhabits the same diegetic world as the characters and actions he recounts. A secondary narrator may be homodiegetic in the sense that he is a character in the narrative he recounts and refers to himself in the first person, the“I” of Proust’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A la recherche du temps perdu </em>; or he may be heterodiegetic if he narrates a story in which he is not a character (Scheherazade in relation to the tales she weaves).</p>
                <p>As Genette suggests, nothing prevents factual narratives from using the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ulterior narration</em> (the pastness of all historical accounts), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">anterior</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">narration</em> (all predictive scenarios based on an analysis of facts), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simultaneous</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">narration</em> (ethnographic notes that detail the unfolding of a ceremony), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">intercalated narration</em> (as in exchanges of real letters). Factual narrators may also be either heterodiegetic or homodiegetic according to whether they participate or do not participate in the events they are recounting. However, factual narratives do not make  “too massive” a use of different narrative levels. As Genette observes,  “One has trouble imagining a historian or a writer of memoirs giving over to one of his ‘characters’ the task of recounting an important part of the narrative. ”43</p>
                <p>As Genette observes, it is rare to find examples of the application of literary theory to nonfictional texts. Ann Rigney’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rhetoric of Historical</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Representation</em> is therefore quite exceptional as it undertakes the comparative analysis of three nineteenth-century histories of the French Revolution: Alphonse de Lamartine’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Histoire des Girondins</em>, Jules Michelet ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Histoire de la Révolution française</em>, and Louis Blanc’s work of the same title. Rigney is concerned with the ways in which three historians, using the“same” historical material, write three very different histories of the revolution. What rhetorical procedures, she asks, make possible such radically different interpretations?</p>
                <p>Rigney responds in the following terms. The meaning of an event and the intelligible relationship between events are not givens of historical data; rather, it is the act of narration, whether performed by contemporary witnesses or historians analyzing events retrospectively, that produces meaning and links a set of events in causal sequence. Moreover, events that actually took place necessarily undergo a transformation in which the mainly nonverbal reality is mediated by the verbal signs of language:“Events are invested with significance, are constituted as signifiers, in the very act of being referred to and represented in discourse. ”44 This discourse is shaped by the narrative codes according to which the historian selects and configures historical actors, actions, and situations. It is useful, I think, to follow in some detail how Rigney applies narratological analysis to historical texts.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rhetoric of Historical Representation</em> pre-dates the publication of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fiction et diction</em>, but Rigney has already taken up Genette’s call for exemplary analyses of works of nonfiction based on what literary theory has established about narrative practice. Indeed, she uses as her tools the categories of narrative that Genette proposes in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Discourse,</em> as outlined above. First, is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">order of representation</em>. Verbal narrative discourse is linear in the sense that it is unable to represent at the same time events occurring simultaneously in different locations, as complex historical events most frequently are. The historian cannot avoid constructing an order of events that is unfaithful to the chronological relationships set forth in documentary sources. By establishing a narrative order, the historian arranges events on the chain of discourse and in so doing imposes a“particular contextual relation ” between them.45 For example, the historian may choose to represent a “secondary” set of events only when they impinge on the narration of the primary set of events. Or, the historian may use a narrative flashback to fill the reader in on what was going on at the same time in another location relevant to the primary set of events. These choices result in structures of meaning. The historian chooses to foreground specific actions while relegating others to the background, focusing the reader ’s attention on what he takes to be the dominant sequence of actions.</p>
                <p>In Rigney ’s example, Lamartine chooses to make the Tuileries the center of action for the insurrection of August 10, 1792, thus privileging the point of view of the royal family and inviting us to identify with the king and especially the queen, the central image of pathos and courage. This focalization of events contrasts with the version of the “same” events as Michelet recounts them: we are positioned narratively on the side of the Commune and experience the“hopes and fears of those about to engage in combat and the difficulties confronting the newly elected Commune.” Only later does Michelet take us to the Tuileries to analyze the king’s defenses. The narrator ’s authority to situate the reader in relation to the action is a powerful technique for producing meaning. The historian centers the action and thus creates a dominant narrative development; he articulates the dominant sequence of actions with other centers of activities, carefully timing the “cuts” between one actorial sphere and another. Differences of narrative focus impose different ideological perspectives.</p>
                <p>A second important notion is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">degree of presence</em>. Relying on Genette ’s concept of narrative speed, Rigney points out that an event ’s importance can be judged according to the amount of textual space the historian gives to it in relation to other events in the same account. This is what Menachem Brinker calls the event’s“signifying relief.” Textual expansion is a technique of foregrounding. In scenic representations, narrative pace is slowed down in order to evoke an action in all its detail. The reader is invited to visualize the scene and to“revivify ” it in his imagination. In nineteenth-century historical representation, Rigney shows, “‘signification’ and‘vividness ’ work closely together”:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Those instances where unique historical moments are scenically represented —where“the events themselves ” appear to speak for themselves or where the reader is made an“eyewitness” to events —may be paradoxically the locus of the heaviest symbolic and rhetorical investment on the part of the historian.46</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>A similar kind of foregrounding can be found in the historian’s use of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">singulative</em> as opposed to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">iterative</em> representations. A narrative event made up of similar, repeated actions—the example Rigney gives is the insurgents ’ slaughter of members of the Swiss Guard attempting to escape from the Tuileries—can be treated in radically different ways. Lamartine represents the event as a series of individual“blow-byblow” accounts and thus underscores what he sees as the insurgents’ blood-thirsty character. Michelet refers to the same events in sylleptic fashion; that is, he condenses the various“repetitions” into a relatively brief passage, a detachment that undercuts any sense of pathos.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Representation en creux</em> is the name Rigney gives to strategies that defuse and neutralize the (unwelcome) significance of events that the historian cannot omit because the historical record or other historians have brought them to prominence. Those who would“rehabilitate” the Revolution, for example, must deal with the Terror by making it retreat into the “hollow” of history. One method for discovering what the relief of a text leaves in shadow is to analyze the text’s unfolding, paying attention not to what is included, but to the elements of the historical <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fabula</em> (story material) that have been excluded. Taking her cue from the work of Philippe Hamon, Rigney observes that narrative triage is at the center of the production of meaning:“to signify is to exclude. ” Very often, she points out, the events the historian foregrounds are “a reflection <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a contrario</em> ” of what he wants to cast in shadow. Michelet’s emphasis on the fraternal and conciliatory character of the insurgents can be seen as the inverted image of the sometimes gratuitous violence of the insurgents ’ actions of August 10. Likewise, Lamartine ’s portrait of the “charismatic” Marie-Antoinette hides the indecision and weakness of Louis XVI.</p>
                <p>The theoretical texts I have surveyed here address the problem of distinguishing fictional and nonfictional literary texts. Most rely on the fundamental distinction between the poetic or imaginative role of fiction and the pragmatic role of nonfiction. Hamburger’s notion that  “reality statements” are predicated on an identifiable speaking subject is universal in its application and therefore historical narration in film must, in ways that are specific to that medium, acknowledge the existence of this pragmatic entity. Real pastness can be established only in relation to the real presence of the discursive voice. Searle’s work on speech acts —the relationship between word and world—confirms Hamburger ’s view. Genette formulates this relationship in terms of the equation: the author = the narrator, which eliminates the buffer between author and text and therefore between the author and his public. Mannoni conceptualizes the conditions of spectacle—and of fiction—on the basis of a contract that organizes the pleasure of the spectator by suspending the conditions of the real. Hamburger’s assertion that the representation of the subjectivity of characters <em class="notranslate" translate="no">from the inside</em> belongs to fiction alone is certainly far from absolute; as Schaeffer argues, any analysis of historical action is an attempt to understand the intellectual and emotional constitution and attitudes of the actors.</p>
                <p>As we saw in Chapter One, historical narratives often speak of intentions, reactions, states of mind, and other features of mental activity. However, several theorists raise the question of semblance: to what extent are historical narratives authorized to give to their texts an impression of reality, replete with scenic tableaus and dialogue <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">extenso</em>? Genette’s work in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fiction et diction</em> has the immense value of establishing that fictional and nonfictional texts do not call on different categories of narration. In Schaeffer’s formulation, fictional and factual discourses have the same“posture of representation ”; both are representations of the world of experience, and both engage therefore in mimetic activity. The difference between the factual and the fictional, Schaeffer argues, is that fiction is free of constraints other than its own internal coherence, whereas history is bound to produce a representation of events that is homological with events as they actually occurred in the historical past; the historian can only recount what it is possible to know about past occurrences.</p>
                <p>However, as Genette and Rigney demonstrate, historians can and do play with the order of narrative. They take advantage of the relative speed of narration as an essential tool of emphasis, and they render certain events in relative richness of detail while relegating others to the shadows. Similarly, historical narration is characterized by a specific placement of narrative voice: the historian/narrator is always an extradiegetic narrator, by definition placed by time on the outside of the events he relates. Historical narration is also by definition ulterior: historical events exist as pastness in relation to the present of narration. Rigney gives us an exemplary analysis of great historical texts and elucidates the ways in which strategies of narration create meaning. Her comparative reading of several texts shows how the rhetoric of history consists in adopting a narrational perspective that distinguishes between primary and secondary narrative actions, what belongs to the foreground or background of historical events.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Signifying History in Film</strong></p>
                <p>This section addresses the question of how two very different signifying systems —written discourse and audiovisual discourse —approach the representation of history.</p>
                <p>I have argued that literary theory has been crucial in understanding the nature of nonfictional narratives and provides useful tools for analyzing the historical film. However, to state the obvious, literary theory emerges from the study of written texts, and its application to filmic narratives must take account of the differences between the exclusively verbal nature of written narratives and the audiovisual nature of film. We are now raising the crucial question of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">vehicle</em> that conveys narrative and discursive information. How do the different mediums of expression —the written language of the historian, the audiovisual language of the filmmaker —shape the representation of historical events? Is written language the only legitimate vehicle for historical narration? Does cinema fail in its attempts at representing history because it is an inappropriate medium for such discourse? Or does the cinematic signifier impose differences of expression that can nonetheless produce legitimate forms of historical discourse?</p>
                <p>In his well-known article,“Historiography and Historiophoty, ” Hayden White calls on historians to revise their approach to visual material. He observes that, in the age of photography and cinematography, sources of historical evidence are as often visual (or audiovisual) as they are verbal. Enclosed in a discipline of words, history has failed to recognize the specificity of the visual media and has attempted to master the image by reducing it to the status of illustration, a simple complement to written discourse. The use of visual evidence, White argues, requires historians to revise their methods of analysis and learn the“lexicon, grammar, and syntax ” appropriate to visual media. Moreover, the image is not just another source of historical information; it can constitute“a discourse in its own right, ” with modes of representation that are fundamentally different from those of written language. White suggests that visual representations of history have their own genius, particularly in the realms of“landscape, scene, atmosphere, complex events such as wars, battles, crowds, and emotions. ” Such representations are not only more verisimilar, he contends, but also more accurate.</p>
                <p>Other historians and film historians point to the disturbing impact film has on what historiography has traditionally conceived as legitimate modes of reference to the past. Robert Rosenstone speaks of film ’s“new ways of thinking about our past, ” which historians may find “unsettling because they escape the confines of words and provide elements —visual, aural, emotional, subconscious —that we don’t know how to admit into our knowledge.”47 Marcia Landy describes the sense of history communicated through film as“fictive and eclectic, ” qualities that historians are bound to find disconcerting:“To acknowledge its fictiveness and its affectivity is to invoke a sense of history as construct, further, to extend the ways in which it functions in more heterogeneous ways than is often acknowledged in the question for an objective measure of the‘truth’ of the events enacted. ”48 In his article “Hitler: A Film from Germany,” historian Rudy Koshar reflects on Syberberg’s film as an example of how “cinema can array jarring, immediate, specific and compelling narratives.” In spite of its apparently ahistorical perspective and antinarrative structure, Koshar suggests the film “moves us closer to the‘structure of feeling’ that nurtured Nazism, gave it its popular resonance, and ensured its mass support. ”49</p>
                <p>How can we begin to discuss the difference between filmic and written representations of history that seems to unnerve some historians and call for a radical rethinking of the discourse of history? As a first step in the inquiry that preoccupies the following chapters, I propose turning to the question of film language and to the semiology of cinema, which has closely studied the specific characteristics and capacities of the film medium.</p>
                <p>As the work of Christian Metz has shown, the semantic power of the cinema is unlimited: there is no area of human experience about which film cannot speak. Indeed, the filmic signifier is unusually rich as it brings into play five matters of expression, to use Louis Hjelmslev ’s formulation. Film is made up of photographic images in movement that imitate observable phenomena in the world—an indexical system of signs that is often designated as the essential feature of film as discourse. But the cinematic image can also incorporate written language, in the form of intertitles (utterances that belong to the plane of narration and by means of which the narrator intervenes directly in the telling) and filmed written texts—letters, proclamations, newspaper headlines, scrolling texts on a computer screen, and the like— that belong to the plane of the narrated, to the diegetic world of the characters. The visual and graphic systems are complemented by the soundtrack, which accounts for three of the matters of expression: spoken language, which can take the form of the narrational voice-over or dialogue between characters; the noise track, which is a major source of information about the diegetic environment the film constructs; and the music track, which has great connotative power, both in the musical score (coming from the narrational plane) and in the diegetic music that emanates from the world of the characters. Moreover, the relationship between the visual and the auditory increases the complexity of cinematic discourses and their powers of representation. The relationship between sound and image plays on differences. The elements of speech, noise, and music may or may not be synchronous with the image, they may belong to the world of the diegesis or not, and they may come from different levels of narration. This extraordinary diversity of the filmic signifier makes it a rich instrument of communication, and because film includes verbal discourse, both written and oral, cinema is capable of using all the semantic resources of language.</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Récit écrit, récit filmique</em>, Francis Vanoye offers a table of the differences between written and filmic narrative based on the distinctions formulated by Hjelmslev.50 This table is helpful in rethinking what the specificity of signifying systems has to do with the character of a narrative discourse: in particular, the way the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">how</em> of the signifier affects the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">what</em> of the signified.</p>
                <p>Vanoye ’s table nicely juxtaposes the features of written and filmic systems of signs. First, we notice that written and filmic narratives are distinguished primarily by the substance of expression—the different tangible materials that serve as the base of the two systems. The signifier in written language is homogeneous—graphic traces that stand out from the white background of the page; the signifier in film is heterogeneous —that is, it makes use of several materials. If we tend to accept the moving photographic image as the defining feature of the system, we have to acknowledge the signifying functions of the soundtrack and the inclusion of the graphic traces of written language. In the case of written language, the graphic traces, as linguists have established, stand in an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">unmotivated</em> relationship to the signifieds they support; the letters—and the voiced phonemes they represent —have no necessary relationship to the representations they evoke in the mind. As philosopher C. S. Peirce would have it, verbal language is of the order of the symbol, operates according to laws of interpretation, and is therefore, in Saussure’s sense, linguistically arbitrary. Andre Martinet makes a similar distinction in talking about the double articulation of language: the choice of units of meaning (from a paradigm like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">before, during, after</em>) operates at a level that is separate from the second articulation in which the user/speaker chooses distinctive units from the paradigm of phonemes (the choice of consonants distinguishes the phonemic sequence of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">die</em> from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pie</em>).</p>
                <p>When we consider the filmic signifier par excellence—the photographic image in movement —we have to agree with Christian Metz’s careful semiological analysis. The filmic image has nothing that corresponds to the double articulation of language:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>There is nothing in the cinema that corresponds, even metaphorically, to the second articulation. This articulation is operative on the level of the signifier, but not on that of the significate [signified]: Phonemes and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a fortiori</em> “features” are distinctive units without proper signification. Their existence alone implies a great <em class="notranslate" translate="no">distance</em> between“content” and“expression. ” In the cinema the distance is too short. The signifier is an image, the significate [signified] is what the image represents.51</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In film, the relationship between signifier and signified (between the signifying material of patterns of light and dark, color, etc., and the representations they make) is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">motivated</em>. The filmic image is an indexical system, to use Pierce’s notion: there is a phenomenological relationship between the sign and the denoted object. The patterns of light and shadow that form the image of a horse are produced through the direct  “contact” between the recording medium and the object. The filmic image, to use Andre Bazin’s metaphor, signifies a bit in the manner of the skin the serpent sloughs off: it is no longer part of being but retains something of its living features.52 Thus, in the production of the image, there is no process of symbolization, none of the arbitrary character of linguistic signs, and therefore very little of the kind of mediation that results from double articulation. The filmic image establishes a quite different set of relationships between the three aspects of the sign: the signifier (the matter), the signified (the mental representation), and the referent (the denoted object conceived as part of the real). The process of signification in film appears to conflate the signified and the referent. The spectator receives the image“from outside” and not through an internal mental operation in which the word evokes an image in the mind. Signification is then a process of recognition in which the spectator “reads” the distinctive visual traits of “objects” produced by the film in the richness of their phenomenological detail. Reading the signs of the manufactured image is then analogous to reading the visual landscape in life, and the spectator is unable to completely detach the image/index he is reading from the phenomenal reality it represents. Film ’s strong sense of presence is due not only to this richness of its signifier, but also to the spectator’s impression that he is gaining access to a world of reference without the alienating mediation of language: the film does not signify“horse” but gives us “this horse” in all the concrete detail of its existence.</p>
                <p>If we return to Vanoye’s table, we notice that, on the level of the substance and form of the content, there is no difference indicated between written and filmic narratives. Both represent“real or imaginary events, emotions, ideas taken from the substratum of history, legend, etc. ” Both produce “structures of narration, feelings, ideas, themes. ” However, as Vanoye points out, the fusion of the planes of expression and content —the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">how</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">what</em> —produce meanings that are specific to the medium. The fact that film produces meaning through patterns of editing results in narrative sequences that are different in nature from narrative sequences recounted in written language. A film may adapt and narrate the content of a novel and therefore produce in film the “same” story; yet, even in the most routine or faithful adaptations, the film is obliged to subject the narrative material to the specificity of filmic expression. Thus, Vanoye insists,“the four elements of signification can only be considered together. The temporal structure of a narrative (form of the content) cannot be separated from its realization through the forms of the signifiers.”53</p>
                <p>Differences in the nature of the signifier in literary and cinematic narratives lead to the particular genius of each medium. Cinema gives us a convincing analogue of concrete space, mimics to perfection the flow of time within the single shot, and reproduces the movement of real phenomena in space. Given the concreteness of its expression, it is not surprising then that film has difficulty expressing abstract notions. Literary texts, on the other hand, have immense powers of abstraction since language is the source of all intellection, but fall short of producing a persuasive imitation of real phenomena as they occur in space and in time. Andre Gaudreault expresses this difference in the following terms:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The “all powerful” word…, which can at once serve to discourse on the world and on itself, actually runs up against certain limits: it cannot render the least exact image of the world, which it intends, all the same, to stand for. And it is nonetheless this quasi-universal capability of standing for, which it owes to its faculty for abstraction, that constitutes all its strength. But this is also, paradoxically, all its weakness: this faculty for abstraction prevents it from rendering with exactitude certain realities, in terms of their spatial relationships, but also to a lesser degree in terms of their temporal relationships.54</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>By their form of expression, literary narratives are extraordinarily versatile. Homogeneously verbal, written texts can move with ease between moments of “objective” narration and others in which the narrator intervenes to editorialize about characters or events. They shift fluently between levels of narration: a secondary narrator imposes his perspective without the visual devices that classic cinema invented to express subjectivity. Written narration negotiates movements in narrated time with simple temporal markers; it is the master of the narrative ’s tempo, accelerating or slowing the depiction of events.</p>
                <p>The form of expression in film is less pliable. The individual shot has, as we have seen, a kind of spatial and temporal integrity that resists abstraction. It preserves absolute spatial and temporal continuity and shows, rather than tells, the actions and the setting it represents. However, as the filmmaker edits shots into sequences, he acquires the narrational power that belongs to the author of written narrative. This paradox of a showing that is also a telling is evoked in one of Christian Metz ’s early essays:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Bela Balazs already demonstrated how film, the apparent twin brother of the theatrical play… in reality comes closer to the novel because of the image-track, which an invisible narrator, very similar to the novelist and, like him, standing outside the events he recounts, unfolds before the eyes of the spectator in the same manner as the novel’s narrative aligns sentences that move directly from the author to the reader.55</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Andre Gaudreault analyzes the complex character of cinematic representation by showing that the film is constructed at two different stages of the process of production and that the“filmmaker” is in fact two “authorial” agents with different functions at the moment of mise en scene and at the moment of editing. In the first stage, the film calls on a<em class="notranslate" translate="no">monstrateur</em>(an“exhibitor”) responsible for “putting into the film can a multitude of micronarratives [shots] that, each and all, have… a certain narrative autonomy.”56 One task of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">monstrateur</em> consists in preparing the material to be shot—actors, sets, lighting, costumes — that is, performing the function that is analogous to theatrical staging. The second function of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">monstrateur</em> is more properly filmic: the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise en cadre</em> —the compositional and semantic function of framing the individual shot.</p>
                <p>Once the images are“in the can,” a second agent —the author as the narrator of the story’s events—appears whose function it is to shape and organize the material of the shots into a coherent whole. As Gaudreault puts it, the filmmaker/editor must“work on the narrative substance in order to cancel out the autonomy of the shots and to inscribe in it the itinerary of a continuous reading.”57 This process constructs a continuity in space and time through the technical matching of shots, the creation of narrative sequences, and the relationships the film establishes between image and sound. The filmic narrator performs the function analogous to the author of written narratives: he organizes the materials into a chain of narrated events. (I would add that this division of filmmaking into two distinct phases is not a temporal reality. It is clear that the filmmaker, in setting up and framing the shot, is already preparing for the discursive moment when the shot will assume its place in the edited sequence and the story’s unfolding.)</p>
                <p>It is important to underscore the difference to which film’s two-phase process gives rise. The filmic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">monstrateur</em> works to put in place the elements of a scene, which he subsequently frames through positioning the camera. The resulting shots are defined by the concrete quality of space and time they imitate and by the strict perspective imposed by camera placement. It is also important to note that the historical development of film as a discourse—in particular, through the productive act of editing —has tended to impose certain limits on the capacity of the moving image to narrate. As Noel Burch points out, the cinema, in the so-called primitive period, was able to codify the relationship between succeeding shots in terms of their greater or lesser spatial proximity and their relationship in time. That is, the creation of a narrative  “whole” from the pieces of the shots depends on the spectator’s ability to “measure” the space and time of each succeeding shot in terms of its relative closeness or distance from the one that preceded it.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Starting from the alternating shots in the work of Porter and the British film-makers, and the earliest contiguity matches (matches of direction and eyeline), this evolution, through the increasing ubiquity of the camera, was ultimately to succeed in establishing the conviction that all the successive separate shots on the screen referred to the same diegetic continuum. In other words, the time spans represented were linked together by relations of immediate succession, simultaneity, or a more distant anteriority or posteriority; the spaces pictured communicated directly or at one or more removes; and above all the whole [chain of shots] constituted a milieu into which the spectator might penetrate as an invisible, immaterial observer, yet one who not only saw but also“experienced” all that transpired there.58</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Thus, the specificity of cinematic narration developed as film acquired the ability to produce continuity from successive, disparate shots without recourse to verbal language in the form of either a“lecturer” present during the screening or frequent and controlling intertitles. To refuse the intervention of language at this level—the placing of shots in sequence —is to accept the limits of representation that the filmic signifier imposes.</p>
                <p>A similar analysis can be made of film’s attempts to construct the equivalent of editorial commentary. Commentary that uses the medium of dialogue is perceived as cinematic, on condition that the verbal exchange is credible in the context of the diegetic world the film produces. Extradiegetic verbal commentary (voice-over or intertitles) has the “weakness” of signaling the intrusion of a narrating voice and calling into question the“self-sufficiency” of the discourse of images.  “Cinematic metaphors”—like Eisenstein’s comparison of Kerensky and a strutting mechanical peacock in his film<em class="notranslate" translate="no">October</em>—have the“disadvantage” of creating a heterogeneous alternation of images: one is diegetic (Kerensky, who belongs to the narrated world of the October Revolution), the other extradiegetic (the peacock, which intrudes into the diegetic world on the sole“authority” of the authorial voice). The resulting sequence as a whole has an abstract character because the spectator is called on to realize in thought the comparison between the signifieds of the images: Kerensky is like a peacock and is therefore endowed with the connotation of strutting vanity ascribed to the peacock. Only the musical score, relegated to the perceptual background of the spectator ’s experience, retains a“cinematic” character because its intervention is essentially emotional rather than intellectual. Unless it becomes pointedly commentative—as in the ironic counterpoint between image and sound—music in classic cinema remains the “unnoticed” instrument of narrational manipulation.</p>
                <p>We come then to the crux of the problem of cinematic representations of history. Given the qualities of the cinematic signifier and the kinds of stories film seems“destined” to tell, should we conclude that cinema as a signifying practice does not show an aptitude for narrating history? There are, I think, two aspects to the question. First, since actors and events in historical narratives are essentially collective in nature, is the filmic image, grounded in the specificity of a moment and a place, an unsuitable vehicle for representing such abstract entities and actions? Second, does film tend to preserve the autonomy of the diegetic world it creates and therefore suppress the kind of authorial intervention —the historian’s voice—that is a hallmark of historical narration? If we answer yes to these questions, then we are led to ask a third: do representations of history in film demand a conscious reworking of the “natural” modes of cinematic narrative? I believe that writing history in film requires precisely this kind of reworking, as I attempt to show in the analyses of films in the succeeding chapters.</p>
                <p>As I have argued, one major difference between fictional and historical narration comes from the way in which the two types of narrative  “justify” a sequence of actions. In fiction, it is the principle of verisimilitude that rules over the believability of succeeding moments of action: the spectator accepts characters and actions as credible if they correspond to his perception of what is“normal” in“real ” life or if they correspond to the sets of conventions that determine what can be expected in the more artificial world of genres. In historical narratives, motivation is predicated on historical truth.“Truth” is not reader centered in that historical narratives do not seek to construct historical events according to what the public is inclined to take as believable. It is, rather, author centered, in that the historian is expected to explain the reasons for events, especially when they do not correspond to what the public perceives as credible.</p>
                <p>Many historical narratives, like many fictional narratives, are constructed as chronological sequences of events that imply at the same time the causal relationship between them. However, the historian is often called on to intervene because the causal link between events is not obvious to the ordinary reader and must be explicated by historical commentary. History cannot rely consistently on the reader’s perception of what is“normal” in the world because the narratives it tells belong to the“strangeness” that Michel de Certeau sees as the essential character of the historical past. Moreover, there is the general (although not obligatory) expectation that historical discourse make reference to its apparatus of erudition. This implies frequent discursive interventions that interrupt the“reading in continuity ” to cite archival sources or the work of other historians, either directly in the text or in the form of the footnotes. All such interventions are evidence of the historical text ’s ability to become discursive and comment on itself.</p>
                <p>For the reasons suggested above, the filmic text does not“naturally” take up the discursive mode. When film speaks about what the images and sounds represent, it has to work at producing its commentary. Narratologists would say that these moments of exegesis are relatively  “costly” because they demand a change in discursive mode—the narrator does not simply narrate; he explains what he is narrating. When a text speaks about itself, it necessarily evokes the situation in which it was produced, what linguists call the text’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">enunciation</em>. It is important, I think, to consider the special modes of enunciation in film, as described by Christian Metz in<em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Enonciation impersonnelle ou le site</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">du film</em>. For Metz, the linguistic model of enunciation is not wholly suitable to film because it is based on the structure of verbal communication: the dialogic exchange that sets up a subject of discourse and his discursive partner (I/you) and anchors itself in a discursive situation through deictic signs: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I</em> designates the person speaking, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">you</em> his partner in discourse, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">here</em> is the place in which the dialogue takes place, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">yesterday</em> is the day before the moment of the enunciation.</p>
                <p>As we have seen, in written historical narratives, the enunciator does not usually make a show of the communicative act. Historians use an impersonal language that avoids signs of their subjectivity: they rarely say “I” or specifically acknowledge the reader/addressee. Historical enunciation reveals itself in the text’s ability to shift from narrative to discursive modes —the telling interspersed with the author’s interpretation or commentary —and in the critical apparatus of historical analysis referenced in the text or in footnotes and bibliography. In film, the enunciator is even more impersonal. He does not say“I” (except in the voice-over identified with the film’s author, and that very rarely); he does not address the spectator as his discursive partner and in fact avoids all such references; he offers little direct information on the context of his enunciation, the context of the film’s production. The so-called nobody ’s shot—the shot that cannot be attributed to the point of view of a character or the perspective of the filmmaker—shows few palpable signs of the enunciative activity. And yet, enunciation in film is never hidden. As Metz argues, it is because the film addresses itself to our perception as projected images and sounds that we remain conscious of it as cinematic construction and never mistake it for the real. The universal mark of enunciation is the existence of the text itself, which is unable ever to eclipse itself behind the world of reference it invokes. To understand modes of enunciation in film, Metz suggests a broader, semiological definition of the term. Enunciation is a“reflexive construction, ” made possible by the ability of a text to double over on itself:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>It is not necessarily, nor always,‘I—HERE—NOW’ [deictic marks of enunciation]; it is, in a general fashion, the ability of many utterances to fold over in places, to appear here and there as if in relief, to slough off a thin skin of themselves that bears the marks of indications of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">another nature</em> (or of another level), concerning the production and not the product.… Enunciation is the semiological act by means of which certain parts of a text talk to us about this text as an act.59</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As Metz points out, the marks of enunciation in film may be more or less conspicuous. The authorial voice-over is the most obvious manifestation of the enunciative act, particularly because it acknowledges that the film is a piece of communication between the narrator and the public he addresses. Metz describes this kind of authorial intervention as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">commentative</em> because it assumes its role so overtly. Other marks are <em class="notranslate" translate="no">reflexive</em> in character and do not stand so obviously apart from the narrative world. They are therefore subtler and may be more or less perceptible to the spectator depending on how knowledgeable he is about the culture of film. The singularity of the way in which a shot is constructed, for example, is a palpable mark of enunciation but will certainly strike with more impact the spectator who is able to measure the distance between the exceptional shot and the“normal” one. Marks of enunciation become perceptible“against a background of norms and codes. ” Whereas in written discourse marks of enunciation appear in quite prescriptive ways, in film such marks can appear anywhere in the text and derive from any aspect of mise en scene, any effect of the stationary or moving camera or of framing, any relationship established through editing of image or sound.</p>
                <p>Metz gives us a brief inventory of the kinds of marks of enunciation common in film, and it is, I think, valuable to cite them briefly here. There is first the construction of the shot, which becomes remarkable to the extent it plays with the codes that constitute its normative background. The use that Miklos Jancso makes in his historical films of wide-screen shots in which the flatness and depth of landscape dwarf the human figures is a quite extreme example of departure from“normative ” shot construction.</p>
                <p>Second, there are the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">voix d’adresse</em> (modes of addressing the spectator), as in the voice-over mentioned here, but there is also the case of the direct address of the spectator by the actor, signaled by the look into the camera. As I will show in Chapter Four, Angelopoulos ’s historical film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em>, includes striking examples of this transgressive communication between the characters of the diegetic world and the real world of the spectator. The musical score speaks directly to the spectator from the plane of enunciation. If the principle of the musical score is to be unobtrusive, any emphatic effect or ironic counterpoint between music and image becomes a palpable mark of enunciation. Written language, in the form of intertitles, scrolling text, or filmed documents, may also address the spectator in more or less frontal fashion and appear quite frequently in historical films concerned with providing the “historian’s perspective” and with marshalling the evidence provided by documents.</p>
                <p>Third, there are the effects achieved through <em class="notranslate" translate="no">secondary screens</em>, which obey the principle of doubling that is at the source of reflexivity. In contrast to the modes of address, the frame within the frame is a “silent redoubling” because it simply includes within the same space the two “planes” that are at once conjoined and separate. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Players</em>, for example, in which theatrical performance is a constant theme, the cinematic frame is frequently doubled by the theatrical frame —at times, quite literally the proscenium arch —and the interplay between the real and theatrical worlds becomes one of the central enunciative strategies of the film.</p>
                <p>Fourth, there are the effects due to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diegetization of the apparatus</em>, that is, the foregrounding of“technical” effects that play a role in the construction of the diegesis. The heavily stylized use of light and shadow, the nonnormative use of lenses, protracted dissolves, filming through fabric or other diegetic filters, among other effects, shape the way we look at the world of the narrative while making it clear that this vision is the result of the discursive intervention of an enunciator. Eisenstein ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">October</em> is full of such diegetization of the apparatus, for example, in the “overlapping” shots that slow the raising of the bridge separating the government offices and the workers’ demonstration or the “reverse motion” in which the demolished statue of the tsar reassembles itself in the first sequence of the film. Metz also mentions the choice of the actor, whose presence and performance are highly visible, as I will discuss in the next section, devoted to the analysis of Rossellini ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em>.</p>
                <p>Fifth, there is the power of the film to“quote” from other texts and other media. The film-within-the-film is the most obvious manifestation: the inclusion of documentary footage in Tarkovsky’s fiction film about the Russian front in World War II, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ivan’s Childhood</em>, for example. But films are quite as capable of citing all types of literary, visual, and audiovisual production, and such citations are frequent in historical films, such as the montage of visual and verbal documents that constitutes Ken Burn ’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> or Resnais’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Night and Fog</em>.</p>
                <p>A few perceptive historians have come to very similar conclusions about the need in historical films to open up the closed narrative world that film excels at producing. Natalie Zemon Davis argues for a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">reflexive</em> approach to historical filmmaking that calls into question the singular, linear, apparently self-sufficient cinematic narrative of historical events. “Film has,” Davis asserts, “countless possibilities for showing more than one story at once and for indicating in a concise and arresting way the existence of other interpretations.”60 Reflexive strategies should aim to restore to historical film the kind of complexity that written history requires, and Davis enumerates numbers of cinematic techniques —what Metz calls marks of enunciation—that enable film to discourse about itself:“Some have simple Brechtian distancing functions; some evoke multiple tellings or controversy; some locate the film in relation to historical knowledge; some do all three at once.”61 Special effects that disrupt the“transparency” of the image, ironic effects achieved by juxtaposing musical score and action, the mirroring structure of the film-within-the-film, witnesses who comment on characters and action, footage of the filmmaker discussing his intentions, or the simple use of the credits to acknowledge historical sources are all strategies, argues Davis, that can serve to reestablish historical distance in the mind of the spectator, multiply perspectives on historical events, and reveal the process by which the historian/filmmaker uses historical knowledge to reconstruct historical events.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Constructing the King’s Body in Roberto Rossellini’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ris e to&nbsp;Pow er of&nbsp;Louis XIV</em> (1966)</strong></p>
                <p>How can we apply narrative theories of fiction and nonfiction to the historical film? In the following discussion of Roberto Rossellini’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em>, I attempt such an application. The aim of the analysis is to understand where we should situate Rossellini’s film. Is it essentially a work of fiction that dresses up in historical guise, a sophisticated version of the costume drama? Or is it possible to argue that the film belongs to the category of nonfictional discourses, in this case a discourse of historical representation?</p>
                <p>I approach the film from three standpoints. First, does the film belong to the category of pragmatic discourses? Is it an act of persuasion? Does the director assume responsibility for the film’s“truthfulness?” Second, what sort of mimesis does the film engage? Does it abide by the cognitive restraints that characterize nonfiction? What strategies of emplotment does it use? What is the relationship between the film ’s audiovisual representation and the written representation of the film ’s“sources”? Third, what is the impact of film as vehicle of expression on the historical material <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power</em> seeks to communicate? Was the historical subject chosen because it is apt for cinematic representation? What techniques does the film adopt to thwart the sense of presence that characterizes fiction and the easy identification of the spectator with the characters?</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Question of Pragmatics</em></p>
                <p>If we begin with the stated intentions that Rossellini communicated in detail, particularly in his often-cited interview with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinéma,</em> 62 there is no doubt that<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em>was conceived as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diction</em>(to use Genette’s term): a didactic film aimed at educating the mass public about a seminal historical event. Rossellini’s notion that the cinema can deviate from its role as an instrument of pleasure and become a vehicle for the propagation of historical information in the mass media was revolutionary in the period. He adopted the form of the didactic narrative, rejected the constraints of commercial cinema, and worked in the institutional context of Italian television (the RAI). Part of his mission was to address the television public directly. Rossellini believed that he could participate in breaking the conventions of an oppressive“pseudoculture” that held the masses in its sway: “We need to spread among the masses the true essence of the great discoveries and of modern technology.… Doing this, we will help the large masses find themselves in the new world.”63</p>
                <p>Despite his educational aim, Rossellini argues that the maker of historical films should resist the urge to interpret historical materials or organize them pedagogically; rather, he should adopt the role of a simple instrument of transmission, a worker of the image:“I try to interfere the least possible with the image; my only interference consists in finding the point of view and saying what is essential, nothing more. That ’s why I insist most emphatically that I am not at all an artist; I am only a worker, and I love being a worker.”64 In taking such a position, Rossellini glosses over the problem of the historian’s subjectivity and denies the discursive character of historical representation. However, his conception of his role is not far from the (largely unspoken) one that underlies the practice of many contemporary historians: the willful subjugation of the vice of subjectivity in the interest of producing an unbiased historical account, a retelling that finds its story already nascent in the given of historical facts.</p>
                <p>Equally significant is Rossellini’s caveat concerning the pleasuredriven character of cinematic experience. He warns against the“danger” of the cinematic apparatus and the misuse of the image that reduces it to an instrument of seduction for the spectator. Moreover, he repudiates cinema’s aesthetic quality, the pleasurable experience of beauty that detaches the spectator from the image as a meaningful representation of real experience and contradicts the film’s pragmatic act of communication. Art, he argues, has lost its functionality. It is no longer interested in the historical meaning of events or in making this meaning accessible to a broad public. The historian/filmmaker must take on the role of the pragmatic communicator, and in the interest of preserving the image’s powers of documentation, construct a strategy to prevent the spectator from seeking refuge in the imaginary:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>There is another really important problem: the image, in the dark of the movie theater is seductive, one can so easily take it for a dream that it becomes a refuge, an escape.… If one wants to make cinema into a means for communicating knowledge, all that must be forgotten… I don’t want to seduce, that is, destroy the image in order to keep only those aspects that can seduce. I want to remain as close as possible to things.65</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Rossellini in fact ascribes to the image the power to directly communicate the real, even the historically real. He declares with fervor that the filmmaker should make use of the power of the image—the photographic image in movement —to render past reality in its <em class="notranslate" translate="no">presence</em>, something to which verbal language can only aspire:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Images, with their naked purity, directly demonstrative, can show us the road to take in order to orient ourselves with the greatest possible knowledge.… All of our intelligence, as we know, expresses itself thanks to the eyes. Language, this human conquest which has justly been made divine (it is said that God is the Word), is the ensemble of the phonetic images by means of which, not being able to fix and save the images, we have catalogued all our observations, the great majority of which are visual. [Language] has allowed us to express our intelligence by discerning, classifying, and connecting. Today, finally, we have the images; we have television, we have the RAI.66</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The views reflected in Rossellini’s statement are certainly naive. Historical reality cannot be directly observed and therefore cannot be directly represented in images. There is nothing transparent in historical mimesis. Indeed, I have argued, using narrative theory, that representation in history is a discursive act: the historian sets up a trajectory across the historical field, includes or excludes historical materials, foregrounds certain acts while relegating others to the background, and so forth. As I show, Rossellini’s practice does not always correlate with his pronouncements, but the paratextual markers of his communicative intention are clear. Rossellini seeks to use cinematic  “language” to reach and inform a broad public —the fundamental pragmatism of his discourse cannot be questioned.</p>
                <p>Rossellini sets out through <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em>to establish a meaningful relationship between the present from which he is speaking and the historical world of past events. Therefore, his film meets certain criteria of nonfiction. Rossellini is both author and narrator of his film (A = N is Genette’s definition of nonfiction); he speaks from the position of Hamburger’s real <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I-Origo</em>; he engages in a speech act for which he carries social responsibility. Rossellini submits the historical representations of his film to be judged on the basis of reason and evidence, as indeed they have been. Francois de la Breteque, for example, observed that“in a film reputed to be more ‘serious,’” Rossellini does not hesitate to give us an account of the Sun King’s private  “ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">faits et gestes</em>  ” and allows us to“read what he reads, ” a reference to the closing moment of the film in which Louis recites, in the privacy of his cabinet, a maxim from La Rochefoucault:“Ni le soleil ni la mort ne peuvent se regarder fixement” (“Neither the sun nor death can be looked at fixedly ”).67 Certainly no such critique would be raised against a Hollywood historical spectacle precisely because we know, through conventions of the genre and the star system, that we are not supposed to take seriously any of its representations. As Schaeffer convincingly argues in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pourquoi la fiction?</em> the essential difference between fiction and nonfiction is not the“truthfulness” of a work’s representations but the work ’s claim that it operates according to the reality principle.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Question of Mimesis</em></p>
                <p>In Schaeffer ’s view, all narrative, fictional or nonfictional, assumes the same “posture of representation”; all narrative is based in imitation, that is, the resemblance between the discourse and the world for which it stands as a model. He insists on the active character of mimesis that constructs a representation that did not preexist discourse. Representation, by its nature, positions us as readers/spectators so that we relate to the discourse <em class="notranslate" translate="no">as if</em>“we were really in the situations for which mimemes [mimetic statements] construct the semblance.”68 If, as Schaeffer contends, there is only one referential mode for fiction and nonfiction, both involving semblance, should we not admit the possibility that filmic representation can be a vehicle for historical as well as fictional narrative? Is it possible to concede that the major differences in modes of representation have to do with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">vehicle</em> of narrative: in the case of written history, exclusively verbal representations, and in the case of film, audiovisual and verbal representations? Are we stuck with the notion that film ’s use of the image is a kind of original sin, a surfeit of the concrete, which can only produce an anachronistic revivification of the historical world?</p>
                <p>As Schaeffer, Veyne, and others have argued, the major distinction between fiction and history resides in the cognitive constraints that nonfiction embraces: the historical narrative maintains“local structural equivalencies ” between the model the discourse proposes and historical reality, knowable only through the traces it has left. Is it possible to construct“local structural equivalencies ” if the historical film depends on the inventions of mise en scene? Doesn’t R. G. Collingwood reason that one identifying feature of historical events is their unavailability to perception, the phenomenological absence that writing seems to respect? If one could argue for the authenticity of documentary footage of historical events, a kind of perception in the second degree, can the same be true of historical mise en scene in which every representation is artificially staged? Doesn’t Rossellini belie his conception of “simply looking” at history by using mirrors to create the illusion of place (the Palais du Louvre replaced on the banks of the Seine near Meudon)? Indeed, in interviews Rossellini has described the painstaking work of representation involved in reconstructing an “image” of the past: the choice of written historical texts and the  “archaeological” research on the period that makes visualization possible, the replication of social relations and behaviors, the selection of locations, the construction of costumes and accessories, and so forth. The verbal message takes on“substance” through the visualization of documented facts. This work of incarnation precedes the process of emplotment that gives narrative form to a sequence of visualized facts. Is Rossellini ’s incarnation of documents simply the kind of revivification that contemporary historians reject as antithetical to the pastness of the past, or can it be seen as responding to the“local structural equivalencies ” that historic discourse imposes?</p>
                <p>As Rigney argues, historical events take on meaning as the result of the historian ’s act of writing. The mainly nonverbal material of history is invested with significance through its transformation into written language. Is it possible to say that Rossellini’s film is based in an analogous act of transformation in which the film’s discourse stands as a constructed model for real historical experience? Does historical film, like written historical narratives, place factual events on the chain of discourse and impose“particular contextual relations between them? ” Do the acts of mimesis and narrativization that Rossellini performs constitute structures of historical meaning? Let’s examine the mimetic and narrative strategies that Rossellini adopts.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em> seems to be predicated on the model of political history in which the central protagonists are not collective entities or representative figures, but individuals whose actions have had a demonstrable influence over the lives and destinies of large social groups. In general in his historical films, Rossellini adopts what Peter Brunette calls the model of the great man“who is examined as a representative of his age, usually an age in which… some profound change occurred in the history of human consciousness.”69 In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power,</em> Rossellini narrates Louis XIV’s struggle for absolute dominion that resulted in the creation of the modern, centralized state. Louis pits himself against members of the court who hope to exploit the tradition of the king too distracted by pleasures of war or the hunt to exercise his legitimate power. As Rossellini portrays him, Louis XIV imposes himself, not only through political action, but also through a deliberate program of self-representation. Indeed, Rossellini shows how the iconography of the regime emerges from the construction of the closed, synthetic world of Versailles, the ritualized behavior and hierarchy of the court, and the adornment of the royal body that becomes both an instrument of subjugation and the emblematic expression of power.</p>
                <p>Let ’s look closely at the process of emplotment. Rossellini makes specific narrative choices by deciding what he will foreground in the event-worthy field of Louis’s rise to power and what he will cast into shadow through exclusion. He narrows the scope of historical events, giving us what appears to be a plot of court intrigue: Louis XIV defies the tradition of kings who rule in name only; he plots, with Colbert, the downfall of the surintendant Fouquet, who aspires to replace Mazarin as ruler in fact; and he takes political power into his own hands, constructing an apparatus of absolutism in which power is invested in the fetishized body of the king. In literary terms, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Louis XIV</em> can be described as an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">action plot</em>, in which the central protagonist achieves in the course of events a significant change of situation (a structure common to the“heroic” plots of political history): the determined Louis, cognizant of his historical situation, imposes himself through a strategy of political action and manipulation. The film’s narrative also corresponds to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">plot of character,</em> in which the protagonist undergoes a process of maturation that enables him to achieve this successful outcome: an already determined but untried Louis assumes the heritage of Mazarin, takes on his historic responsibilities, and fulfills the cardinal’s political testament. Rossellini thus chooses to restrict the film’s action to the closed world of the court over a circumscribed period of time, from the death of Mazarin in 1661 to the installation of the full court at Versailles in about 1678.</p>
                <p>In the Rossellinian manner, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power</em> tends to dedramatize action and interpolates into the linear development of the plot moments of apparent “dead time.” The film has nonetheless a clear causal structure. There is the inciting moment, the death of the king’s regent, Mazarin, which poses the question of succession and power. Exposition occurs through conversations in which the characters comment on the background of the action: the dialogue between the dying Mazarin and his confessor evokes the period of the regency, the Queen Mother ’s monologue recounts the history of the distracted and dissipated French kings, Colbert instructs the king on the misdeeds of Fouquet. Louis ’s political move to assume control over the council initiates the rising action that leads to the arrest of Fouquet, a moment of tension and climax. The remainder of the film concerns itself with the political problem of imposing and perpetuating political power. Although this long section lacks the dramatic tension of the first (for reasons I discuss shortly), it develops as a causally constructed sequence of events that results in the narrative’s goal, the embodiment in Louis of state power. Rossellini enjoys the advantage of the unity of action that comes from the stable configuration of characters, juxtaposing protagonists (Louis XIV, Colbert) and antagonists (Fouquet and those who support the surintendant ’s ascent to power). In the manner of fictional narratives, it is the characters’ individual acts that constitute the plot, in contrast to the more complex shifting fields of actions and actors, characteristic of the history of social groups. Indeed, Rossellini has been criticized for this narrow focalization of his narrative because he excludes from discussion the broader social situation and the ramifications for the French people of Louis’s“coup d’etat. ”</p>
                <p>Rossellini ’s circumscribed narrative has another advantage. By restricting the action to historical figures about whom a great deal is known, he is able to make use of the unusually rich documentation on Louis XIV and his court: the commentaries of courtiers and foreign envoys; records of conversations; reports; not only Louis XIV’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mémoires</em>, rich in anecdote and revelatory of Louis’s intentions, but also those of Madame de Lafayette and Madame de Motteville, among others. The “signifying relief” that Rossellini gives to events, the degree of presence that he creates in the succession of scenes that constitute the film, and the dialogue that he puts into the mouths of his characters are justified by documentation, even if he sometimes plays a bit freely with his sources in the process of representing them filmically.</p>
                <p>Rossellini ’s major source of historical information (but not the only one) is historian Philippe Erlanger’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Louis XIV</em> (Erlanger appears as historical advisor in the film’s credits). Erlanger ’s text is the kind of biographical history that must have appealed to Rossellini: it tells its story following the linear development of the king’s life, it avoids excessive discursive commentary, and it presents historical moments with a great richness of anecdotal detail. Moreover, Erlanger’s account of situations and events is enriched with psychological analysis: he foregrounds the historical characters’ intentions, closely intertwining the political and the personal. In the following passage, for example, the historian explains how conceit, self-deception, and fatal underestimation of the personality of the young Louis would lead Surintendant Fouquet to his ruin:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The most brilliant, the most intelligent of the ministers, Nicolas Fouquet, was totally mistaken. Didn’t Anne of Austria say to him with a shrug of the shoulders:“He [the young Louis] wants to look like he’s in charge (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Il veut faire le capable</em>)? ” The Surintendant was convinced that this ardor for work would quickly dissolve under the charm of pleasures, since he, Fouquet, was resolved to spare no effort in allowing His Majesty to drown in them. This corrupter would become the dupe of his own system in believing he could debauch the King. The young man had had a rather morose youth under the thumb of a stingy authority. The Surintendant would give him every fulfillment, would  “spoil” him in the proper sense of the word, and quite naturally unburden him of the responsibilities of affairs of state.70</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The passage adopts a position of narration that is close to classical fiction. The signs of the narrator’s presence—the discourse’s marks of enunciation —are largely effaced in order to give the narrative an autonomous character. Events seem to emerge of their own accord. In this passage, the historian/narrator intervenes directly only twice in order to impose the ironic judgment of history: Fouquet was mistaken, and little did he know that he would become the dupe of his own system. Elsewhere in the passage, the historian relies on indirect discourse, rendering in the third person the internal thought processes of Fouquet ’s character. We“hear” the voice of the historical character who appears to narrate on his own behalf. Indeed, Erlanger’s narration often gives us the signs of subjectivity that Kate Hamburger identifies as essential to fiction:“Epic fiction [the novel] is the only epistemological instance in which the I-origo (or subjectivity) of a character can be evoked in the third person.”71 By contrast, Rossellini ’s film is more externally focalized, restricting itself to representing the characters ’ words and actions as opposed to giving us direct access to their thoughts and feelings.</p>
                <p>If one compares the film’s narrative to Erlanger’s text, it becomes clear how Rossellini reshaped material in the process of transposition. There is of course the necessary work of selection and reduction: the one-hundred-minute film could not have recounted, using the resources of cinematic representation, all the events and all aspects of events that Erlanger’s verbal narrative accomplishes at great length. Rossellini is obliged to construct a simpler narrative by cutting a thinner slice of history. Some events that, in Erlanger’s account, are crucial to motivating Louis’s actions are not represented at all. For example, the sumptuous fete Surintendant Fouquet offers Louis at his chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte—a prefiguration of Versailles —which the king experienced as a humiliation, is not represented at all, perhaps due to Rossellini ’s limited production budget. Other events are represented <em class="notranslate" translate="no">en creux</em> (i.e., receive comparatively minimal treatment). For example, the formulation of economic and social reforms in the early regime is represented by a single short sequence in which Colbert explains to the rapt attention of his king the vision he has for a modernized France. The work of condensation that takes the place of an ample discussion of the revolutionary policies is transparent. On the other hand, the events Rossellini represents as“significant” receive a scenic treatment that gives what Ann Rigney calls the sense of presence: the lengthy and detailed representation of specific actions that the narrative thus pushes into the foreground.</p>
                <p>Through his tendency to evoke as scenes specific historical moments, Erlanger provided Rossellini with the sort of concrete representations that could be transposed through cinematic mise en scene. In most cases, Rossellini scrupulously follows the documented interchanges between characters. He quite accurately represents, for example, Erlanger ’s account of the last meeting between the dying Mazarin and the young king, including the documented dialogue, even if he quotes the doubtless apocryphal statement attributed to Mazarin:“Sire, je crois m ’acquitter de tout en vous laissant Colbert ” (“Your majesty, I believe I have fully done my duty by leaving you Colbert”).72 As Erlanger puts it, if the phrase is not authentic,“it reflects the essential, ” and one cannot really quibble with Rossellini’s decision to include it. Moreover, he uses much of the anecdotal information the text provides in terms of details of behavior, action, or setting, representing through visualization the historical circumstance that Erlanger explicates. The queen ’s chamber maid, Pierrette Dufour, sleeps in the royal apartment, and Rossellini closely follows the historian’s account of how she communicates the news of Mazarin ’s death to the king:“When at daybreak Pierrette Dufour heard the King stir, she approached and silently made the agreed-upon gesture. Mazarin had died between two and three in the morning. ”73 However, in passages where Erlanger <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tells</em> rather than <em class="notranslate" translate="no">shows</em>, transpositions are not so simple or direct.</p>
                <p>Rossellini ’s narrative strategy is to adopt an exclusively<em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimetic</em> mode of representation in which the narrator pretends to give up his power of narration to allow the characters to speak for themselves. The filmmaker thus eschews any discursive intervention in the form of intertitles or voice-over—mediations that would belie his assertion that historical action can be represented“literally” in the detached, observational manner of his earlier films that focused on contemporary reality. This modal constraint leads Rossellini at certain moments to compromise the historical“literalness” of his mise en scene through recourse to theatrical subterfuge. When he wants to include historical commentary on the situation of his characters, he puts the information in the mouth of one his characters. For example, it is the Queen Mother, Anne d ’Autriche, who comments on the historical weakness of the French kings, more interested in the hunt and war than in governing. If the literalness of the dialogue is in question, the information it delivers reflects the Queen Mother’s attitude and is essential to understanding the element of surprise that enabled Louis to outwit and outmaneuver Fouquet. At other points, Rossellini resorts to theatrical conventions, particularly in the guise of choral-like commentary by courtiers on the meaning of actions or“facts of daily life, ” to explain to the spectator what might otherwise remain obscure. We learn, for example, from a dialogic interchange that the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">deuil noir</em> (black as the color of deep mourning) that Louis imposes on the court at the death of Mazarin is usually reserved for royalty. In another instance, the theatrical aside of one anonymous courtier speaking to another tells us that the queen ’s gesture of clapping her hands in bed at the moment of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lever du roi</em> indicates that Louis accomplished that night his nuptial duty. Although the exegesis takes the form of dialogue within the narrative world of the film, the remarks are intended to inform and are clearly addressed to the spectator.</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em>, the sense of the quotidian is expressed in scenes that seem to arrest narrative action and take on a didactic character. For example, the extended consultation between the several physicians attending the dying Mazarin provides an exposition of medical practices in the seventeenth century. Even moments of intense narrative development are accompanied by documentation of historic behavior: the deathly pale Mazarin prepares to receive the king by applying cosmetics, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">les fards de son éminence</em>. These often brief notations of practices and customs are signs of historical difference: what is routine and unexamined in past societies becomes for us unfamiliar and the object of historical curiosity. Observations of historical difference also generate a “real effect” in which the unfamiliar signifies historical contingency. In Rossellinian mise en scene, the accumulation of these signs of the real serves as the immediate context of historical action, undercutting the dramatic character of classical political history. Indeed, Rossellini insists that great historical events occur in much the same manner as events of daily life:“I always try to remain impassive. What I find most surprising, extraordinary, and moving in men is precisely that great actions and great events take place in the same way and with exactly the same resonance as normal everyday occurrences. ”74</p>
                <p>If the entrapment and arrest of Fouquet retain considerable dramatic tension, Louis ’s ascension to power is described in terms of quite undramatic actions and gestures. Many sequences suggest the repetitive (iterative) character of the event described. We are given to understand, for example, that the scene in which Louis consults with the royal tailors about the extravagant courtly attire that is part of his strategy to subjugate the nobility is yet another, still unsuccessful stage in the elaboration of the definitive model. The culminating scene of the film, the representation of Louis in his new state of absolute power, is spectacular in the richness of its mise en scene but quite the contrary of resolution through climactic action. Rossellini’s camera focuses on the details of the king’s repast in the presence of the court and adopts the languorous rhythm of its ritualized unfolding. This narrative stasis allows the moment to take on a figurative character: the agitated, yet controlled activity of the kitchen; the heightened artificiality of pose and gesture that accompany the service; the transformation of dining from a collective activity into an organized spectacle; the imposing solitude of Louis and the rapt subservience of the court—all stand for the triumph and transcendent power embodied in the king.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Vehicle of Expression</em></p>
                <p>Rossellini adopts a particular approach to the representation of historical events that reflects not only his own proclivities as a filmmaker, but also the exigencies of transposing mainly written documentation into an audiovisual discourse. The most important choice, as I attempted to show through narrative analysis, has to do with the kind of historical character Rossellini chooses to represent. In general, he avoids the representation of collective actors, establishing rather a dramatis personae consisting of protagonists capable of making individual choices (Louis XIV or Anne d ’Autriche) and flat characters who perform minor actions that are typical and predictable (the anonymous courtiers or the members of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">peuple</em> who comment on the doctors arriving to treat Mazarin).</p>
                <p>The narrative choice to privilege the individual is also a cinematic one. Because of its penchant for the concrete, film easily represents the individual body that performs individual actions and the concrete space and time in which such actions evolve. Similarly, Rossellini’s use of iterative sequences (a series of shots that stands for the repetition of many similar actions) is a quite cinematic transposition of verbal iterative statements in which repetition is usually expressed through abstract verbal locutions (such an event happened often, over months or years). Thus, Rossellini avoids the textual work of producing abstract entities of collective action, a major concern of other historical filmmakers. The choice of this mode of representation allows him to dispense with the obvious authorial interventions like the voice-over or intertitles; his “transparent” discourse stands in opposition to the mode of historical representation in which a dominant verbal narration marshals the film ’s body of visual illustrations. Rossellini maintains a constant position of enunciation: he opts for mimetic representation that allows the characters and their actions to stand on their own. This position contrasts with the shifting positions of enunciation characteristic of literary histories in which mimetic representation alternates with the discursive interventions of the historians commenting on the meaning of events.</p>
                <p>We could say that Erlanger’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Louis XIV</em> (or rather, portions of that work) has the same substance of content as Rossellini’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rise to Power</em>. However, the filmic substance of expression requires a transposition from one signifying system to another. As Metz and Gaudreault point out, written language is an arbitrary system with relatively weak descriptive capabilities, whereas cinema’s visual track consists of images that are <em class="notranslate" translate="no">motivated</em>signs with strong denotative power. Descriptive words produce images in the mind, whereas images in film come from the outside and flood the spectator with rich phenomenological detail. In Erlanger ’s text, the proper name Louis XIV produces a mental image in the spectator that is tied at best to the memory the spectator has of painterly representations of the king. Rossellini gives us a body —the image of the body of the actor embellished with reproductions of period wigs and apparel. It is this excess of mise en scene, the “body too many,” as Jean-Louis Comolli put it apropos of Pierre Renoir ’s Louis XVI in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em>,75 that disturbs historians and constitutes for the filmmaker one of the great problems of historical filmmaking. Filmmakers may adopt one of two strategies for mitigating this doubling of the actor/character and the phenomenological surfeit of mise en scene. The first consists in an obsessive work of documentation in which the filmmaker, assisted by his historical consultants, attempts to reduce to an absolute minimum the inescapable anachronism that historical representation in film entails. The second consists in developing cinematic counterparts for the abstract quality of written language and its more“versatile” powers of narration. In practice, most historical filmmakers negotiate between these two tendencies, and indeed one could argue that any historical representation in film necessarily involves some kind of fusion between the two.</p>
                <p>In describing the long period of preparation for his historical films, Rossellini suggests that exhaustive documentation is at the base of authentic historical representation. Through his emphasis on representations of daily life and his notion that great events of history take place in the same manner as everyday events, Rossellini seeks to reduce the apparent discord between historical and cinematic representation. However, we should not accept at face value Rossellini’s assertion that writing history in film consists in“simply looking,” because there is nothing simple about the work of mise en scene that constructs what the camera finally “looks at.” Moreover, Rossellini constantly puts in question the apparent self-sufficiency of the narration of events. At many moments, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em> takes on a reflexive character in which a“folding over” of the text, to use Metz ’s formulation, allows the film to talk about its own production. The effect is profoundly ironic: the reality of the scene of history stands on the artifice of representation. In the interest of history, Rossellini reworks the classic relationship between the film and its audience. The body of“techniques” he uses prevents the spectator from an easy identification with characters and events and refocuses his attention on the meaning of dialogue and action.</p>
                <p>There is, first, Rossellini’s tendency to film his actors in a frontal fashion, creating presentational postures that tend to impose distance between spectator and characters. In many instances, the camera takes up an immobile position within a scene, and the actors turn their bodies to the camera. Short sequences—often composed of a single shot — are particularly static in this regard. For example, in the segment in which Colbert describes to Louis his vision for economic development and social reform in France, the actors face the camera, Louis at his desk and Colbert standing at his right, in a stationary medium shot. More complex sequences may include multiple shots and the play of the zoom lens, but, in these as well, Rossellini tends to avoid significant changes in the axis of the camera. With the exception of entrances and exits, he restricts the actors’ movement within the frame and often maintains them in relatively rigid poses. This technique evokes the theatrical convention of the proscenium, the kind of static representation that cinema gradually abandoned in the primitive era in favor of a more cinematic expression.</p>
                <p>Rossellini thus prevents the spectator from“penetrating” into the scene by rejecting the techniques of analytic editing: the repositioning of the camera, the variation of angle and distance that communicate narrative and psychological information and condition spectator response. The film rejects the interpolation of closer shots through editing and especially subjective shots. There is only one example of a classic point-of-view series in the film: as Louis retains Fouquet after the meeting of the council, he looks out the window (the look offscreen) to assure himself that D’Artagnan is ready to arrest the surintendant (object of the look). Moreover, the film’s presentational mode is enhanced by the use of long takes and, in some instances, shot sequences. This static shooting strategy is facilitated by the Pancinor zoom, which produces a fluid movement between different focal points, shifting between longer and closer views of the scene without shot changes.</p>
                <p>Other effects contribute to this ironic“flattening” of mise en scene. The choice of actors, particularly in the case of Jean-Marie Patte as Louis XIV, plays on the disappointment of spectator expectations: how can this actor ’s body be equated with the historical body of Louis XIV? The neutrality of Patte’s facial expression and his deliberately flat delivery of lines further underscore the dissonance that Rossellini develops between the mechanism of transmission and the historical reality to which it refers. Despite his pronouncements, Rossellini’s mise en scene is already a critique of the possibility of revivification.</p>
                <p>The composition of the frame often underscores this tendency to visual flatness and inertia through a conscious imitation of pictorial composition in seventeenth-century painting. Take, for example, the moment in the long sequence of the consultation between physicians in which Mazarin submits to bleeding: the cardinal slouches in a chair, his elongated body draped in white, creating a diagonal composition of mortal agony. Rossellini’s imitation of painterly composition has been variously interpreted. Martin Walsh argues that Rossellini uses the technique to attenuate the“degree of‘naive ’ realism”76 that would be the result of a more “cinematic” relationship between camera and action. De la Bretheque sees in the imitation of historical iconography an inherent flaw in cinematic mise en scene:“It comes down to saying, once again, that access to the‘reality’ of a period can only be obtained through representations that are already mediated in the past.”77 Both positions are based on a similar analysis, although they reach quite opposite conclusions. In response to de la Bretheque, I would argue that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mimesis</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">praxeos</em>, Aristotle’s term for the imitation of action in verbal narratives, is what historians do. Any form of mimesis involves mediation, and certain features of mediation in written discourse are particularly striking. Peirce insists that the words of a language— <em class="notranslate" translate="no">symbols</em> in his classification of signs —resemble only through the“force of a law,”78 and the great distance between the linguistic signifier and signified imposes a level of abstraction that is always a“betrayal” of the referent.</p>
                <p>I would contend that Rossellini’s film shows an acute awareness of the danger inherent in cinematic mise en scene and its referential function: the “world of the past” can be invoked in such richness of detail that the spectator can fantasize the presence of history and engage in a relationship with the actor/characters that ignores the distance between the instrument of representation and the historical person. It is plain that Rossellini ’s pictorial treatment of scenes has a deliberately artificial character, and, I would argue, this reflexive structure that foregrounds the mimetic act is part of a strategy that aims at exposing to the spectator the synthetic and mediated quality of historical representation. Rossellinian mise en scene turns on representational irony. He says in effect: this is and is not the figure of Louis XIV; these are and are not the acts that led to absolutism in seventeenth-century France.</p>
