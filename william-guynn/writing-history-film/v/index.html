                <p>In this section of the study, I raise two sets of questions. The first concerns the nature of historical representation: What is the relationship between a historical narrative and the reality in the past to which it refers? What models have philosophers and historians proposed for refiguring the past? The second set addresses the rhetoric of historical representation in film: How do films refigure the historical past? What differences are there between rhetorical strategies in filmic, as opposed to written, histories? Can both historical documentaries and historical films of mise en scene be considered legitimate forms of historic discourse?</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Th e Reality of the Past and Historical Narration</strong></p>
                <p>In his philosophical investigation of historical narration, Paul Ricoeur begins with the question that underlies all the others: “What does the term ‘real’ mean when it is applied to the historical past?”1 As Ricoeur observes, it is an embarrassing question because answering it embroils the historian in a discussion of the problems of knowledge: the documents on which the reality of the past is predicated are fragmentary, selective, and conserved in the interest of particular social forces and political initiatives. Despite what the historical science brings in terms of rigor and method, the historian can only narrate what the historical record, with its biases, allows him to know or infer about the past. Moreover, he can only attempt to avoid the pitfalls of subjectivity, the unspoken affinities and predilections that underpin the questions he asks about the past; he can only attempt to counterbalance the weight of the present moment that can distort or displace his point of view. And yet, the recourse to documents and the reliance on method are the historian’s refuge, the inescapable condition that founds history’s difference from fiction. The historian does not invent his narrative; he <em class="notranslate" translate="no">reconstructs</em> it, and he does so under the ethical imperative of fidelity: “Through documents and their critical examination of documents, historians are subject to what once was. They owe a debt to the past, a debt of recognition to the dead, that makes them insolvent debtors.”2</p>
                <p>From this ethical position stems the special character of historical representation. In written fiction, to represent means to produce mental images of things—settings, characters, actions—that are absent but imagined as present. Historical narratives do not attempt to evoke an illusory presence since history’s aim is to preserve the pastness of events. Indeed, the debt the historian owes to the past excludes such free imaginative activity, and the reader of history, for his part, is called on to curb the projective activity of identification with character and action and to respect the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">having-been-there</em> of the past. Historical knowledge passes through the concrete vestiges of the events that mediate all reference to history. It is worth reviewing here Ricoeur’s notion of the trace. On the one hand, the trace marks the moment of the past to which it bears witness —concrete testimony that shows that “a man, an animal passed by here.” On the other hand, like all signs, the trace is perceptible in the here-and-now and invites the historian to move back in time to find the activity (the cause) that left this vestige (its effect). The trace is therefore a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sign effect</em>, and the historian’s task is to make it speak in his discourse. The past is conceived as a “vis-a-vis” in relationship to which the historian constructs his narrative. In history, to represent means to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">stand for</em> and the notion of standing for distinguishes history from all other modes of representation.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Three Modes for Understanding Historical Mimesis</strong></p>
                <p>Ricoeur argues, however, that the concept of standing for does not resolve the enigma of the relationship between the discursive and the real. Through what process, on the basis of what model, does discourse construct its representations? Ricoeur proposes rethinking that relationship in terms of the “great genres” advanced by Plato in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Sophist</em>: the Same, the Other, and the Analogous, each of which corresponds to one of the positions that the philosophy of history has developed to understand the ontological status of historic discourse.3</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Under the Sign of the Same</em></p>
                <p>Under the sign of the Same, philosophical thought proposes reducing the temporal distance between the moment in which the historian writes and the moment of the historical past he is attempting to represent. In this model of knowledge, the historian’s activity results in a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">de-distanciation</em> such that it produces an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">“identification with what</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">once was</em>.” British philosopher R. G. Collingwood’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Idea of History</em> is, for Ricoeur, the exemplary text that defines how historians may conceive sameness as the principle of historical representation. Collingwood contends that the historian’s goal is to detect the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">thought</em> that underlies historical action. Historians, he argues, deal with both the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">inside</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">outside</em> of events. The outside is the behavioral—“everything belonging to it which can be described in terms of bodies and their movements.”4 The inside is that “which can only be described in terms of thought,” and thought includes the full range of human intentions and motivations. The historian’s work is to negotiate between the outside and inside of events until he reaches an understanding of their cause, which is always expressed in terms of thought. Collingwood describes the process in the following way:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The historian of philosophy, reading Plato, is trying to know what Plato thought when he expressed himself in certain words. The only way in which he can do this is by thinking it for himself. This, in fact, is what we mean when we speak of “understanding” the words. So the historian of politics or warfare, presented with an account of certain actions done by Julius Caesar, tries to understand those actions, that is, to discover what thoughts in Caesar’s mind determined him to do them. … The history of thought, and therefore all history, is the re-enactment of past thought in the historian’s mind.5</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Reenacting thought can come only through a complex process in which critical method, historical knowledge, and intuition reconstruct the mind of the historical other. But reduplication bears with it a certain danger because it tends to erase the temporal distance between the historian’s mind and the mind of the other: “Historical knowledge is the knowledge of what mind has done in the past, and at the same time it is the redoing of this, the perpetuation of past acts in the present.” 6 If the past is perpetuated in the present, then what remains of its pastness? Ricoeur argues that there is a final “decisive step” to be made in order to bridge the gap between the historian’s mental reenactment and the inside of historical events. The thought the historian constructs must be posited as “numerically identical” with the thought underlying historical action in order to abolish the distance that separates them. If historical knowledge is essentially knowledge of the thought of the past and if the historian is capable of replicating that thought in his own mind, then there is, in Collingwood’s words, a “sense, and one very important to the historian, in which they are not in time at all.”7</p>
                <p>Thus, by positing his reconstruction of thought as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">same as</em> the thought underlying historical reality, the historian sabotages his own enterprise by obliterating the essential quality of historical events— their pastness. In such a conception, the standing for that characterizes historic discourse’s relationship to events disappears because the two terms of the relationship have become identical. For Ricoeur, Collingwood’s model breaks apart because of “the impossibility of passing from thought about the past as my thought to thought about the past as other than my own.”8 Historical representation is incapable of reducing historical events to an essential <em class="notranslate" translate="no">inside</em> that exists as if out of time.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Under the Sign of the Other</em></p>
                <p>Under the sign of the Other, philosophers of history espouse a position that runs directly counter to Collingwood’s. In a radical critique of historical narrative as replication of the past, they reestablish <em class="notranslate" translate="no">difference</em>— temporal <em class="notranslate" translate="no">distance—</em>as the essential relationship between the historian’s discourse and the reality of the past. Emphasizing the strangeness of the past rather than its familiarity, the historiography of difference combats the tendency of Western historians to manipulate historical material to make it fit into their own predetermined models. The past, the partisans of difference argue, cannot be made to speak with the voice of the present. Ricoeur characterizes this conception of historic otherness as the “negative ontology of the past.”9</p>
                <p>Michel de Certeau offers the most radical conception of difference. He argues that the “historiographical operation” is largely determined by the social “site” of production from which the historian speaks, that is, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">institution of knowledge</em>,10 housed within the university, that determines the profession’s methods and practices. The historian’s first gesture begins the process of misrepresentation. He takes possession of the archival material of history and redistributes it differently. This new cultural distribution “consists in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">producing</em> such documents, through the act of recopying, transcribing or photographing these objects by changing both their place and their status.”11 For Certeau, the historian’s discourse dominates the fragmentary citations of the language of the historic other, forcing them to fit within the structure of meaning it imposes. Thus, the historian’s voice of knowledge speaks for the other who cannot speak for himself. It “grants itself the power to speak what the other signifies without knowing it. Through ‘quotations,’ citations, notes and the entire apparatus of permanent references to a first language … , [the historian’s discourse] establishes itself as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">knowledge</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">of the other.</em>”12 Everything works to substantiate the historian’s authority: documents certify the “factual” basis of the historian’s narrative, while the fragmented and incoherent body of documentation submits to the power of the organizing discourse. “The language cited [the historical traces] thus has the function of certifying the discourse as referential, it introduces into it a real effect, and because of its fragmentation, it refers us back discreetly to a position of authority [the historian’s model].”13</p>
                <p>However, a discourse that “quotes” the other runs a certain risk: its strangeness may well overwhelm the apparent explanatory power of the master discourse. The “other,” through the very strangeness the historian seeks to suppress, may return to unmask the historian’s model. In Certeau’s view, a more authentic history would involve not the construction of models, but the observation of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">gaps</em> between models and the materials they attempt to master. Contemporary history, then, is written on the margins since the historian’s practice is incapable of explaining the meaning of past experience.</p>
                <p>In his critique of Certeau’s model of difference, Ricoeur points out that the notion of the gap is no less atemporal and no more apt at “signifying the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">having-been-there</em> of the past” than the notion of the Same. The gap provides only a negative image of the past, “divested of its properly temporal intention.”14 Certeau’s work is valuable, Ricoeur argues, as a necessary “cleaning operation” that sweeps away the pretensions of mastery on the part of historical discourse and exposes the precarious nature of an enterprise that seeks to resurrect the past by reduplicating it in the present. But, Ricoeur adds, Certeau’s critique serves only as a preliminary operation. It has nothing positive to say about the survival of the past within the present, one of the central questions that historians address. How can difference occupy the role of standing for in relation to a past that “once was real and alive”? Instead of representing the past, it evokes the fleeting shadows of events, which cannot be coerced into discursive or narrative structures. Since historical reality is unknowable, the contemporary world is cut off from any meaningful experience of the past.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Under the Sign of the Analogous</em></p>
                <p>As Ricoeur argues, neither the positivism of Collingwood nor the negativism of Certeau is without merit, and both can perhaps be salvaged under the sign of the Analogous. The Analogous has the virtue of combining notions of the Same and the Other on the basis of “a resemblance between relationships rather than between terms per se.”15 We are no longer in the domain of the Same because the historian does not attempt to reduplicate past events through mental representations. Nor are we in the domain of Difference since the notion of the analogical proposes a positive relationship between discourse and the reality of the past. Under the sign of the Analogous, the historian posits a relationship of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">resemblance</em> between the reality of the past and his discourse about it without compromising the autonomy of either. This relationship is expressed by the term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">standing for</em>, which suggests neither identification with the past nor alienation from it, but something that lies in between.</p>
                <p>For Ricoeur, Hayden White is the key figure in developing a theory of the Analogous. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Metahistory</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tropics of Discourse</em>, White hypothesizes that historical representation is a poetic operation based in analogy: the narrative the historian emplots stands in a relationship of analogy to the events that really took place; the historical character is an analogue of the men and women to whose real existence the trace bears witness. As Ricoeur observes, the structure of historical narrative is complex compared to the basic structure of fiction. In writing history, the historian constructs a “model,” an “icon” that is capable of standing in for past reality. The relationship between the discursive and the real is based in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">likeness</em>, which both separates the discursive from the real—the terms of comparison maintain their identities—and connects them—the terms are nonetheless homologous. This is the same mimetic-homological model that Jean-Marie Schaeffer proposes for nonfiction, in which discourse maintains “local structural equivalencies” with the realities to which it refers (see Chapter 2).</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rhetoric of Prefiguration</strong></p>
                <p>White’s theory of historical rhetoric concerns the initial stage in the development of a historical narrative when the historian draws the fundamental contours of his work. He adopts the word <em class="notranslate" translate="no">prefiguration</em> for this moment of the genesis of discourse. To represent “what really took place,” the historian must first prefigure the field of historical events. White sees in prefiguration the work of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tropes</em> by means of which it is possible to give a first form to the objects of historical knowledge, and this form will have a determining role in the elaboration of a historical narrative. To speak about tropology, White calls on the tradition of rhetoric since Aristotle, the art of eloquence and persuasion and the techniques this art puts in practice. He proposes as fundamental poetic structures the four basic tropes of classical rhetoric: metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony. He is not speaking here, of course, of ornaments of discourse —individual metaphors or metonymies—but of metaphoric, metonymic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">operations</em> that govern the relationship between a discursive representation and the historical reality to which it refers. Metaphor is the central figure and its vocation is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">representative</em> since it functions to establish a relationship of resemblance between the terms of comparison: “Properly understood, histories ought never to be read as unambiguous signs of the events they report, but rather as symbolic structures, extended metaphors, that ‘liken’ the events reported in them to some form with which we have already become familiar in our literary culture.”16</p>
                <p>White suggests that the basic tropes offer structures of meaning, “models of the direction that thought itself might take in its effort to provide meaning to areas of experience not already regarded as being cognitively secured by either common sense, tradition, or science.”17 The four major tropes provide discrete modes of comprehension. The metaphoric operation is a “search for similitudes” between two phenomena that appear at first quite different from each other. Metonymy offers a “mechanistic” idea of the links between phenomena that configures the discursive field as a “complex of part-part relationships,” as in the relation of cause to effect. Synecdoche is the figure of integration that understands specific, concrete phenomena as belonging to an encompassing whole and posits the possibility that any one phenomenon can stand for the totality. Irony is the figure of ambivalence and skepticism, the critic of perceived similarities and differences, offered by “all forms of metaphorical identification, reduction, or integration of phenomena.”18 For White, each type of figuration favors a specific plot genre. Metaphor is linked to romance, metonymy to tragedy, synecdoche to comedy, and irony to satire. However, such a neat correspondence between figures and genres leads to a system of classification that undercuts the depth of White’s insight and limits the power of rhetorical analysis. If metaphor is the basic figure, Ricoeur suggests that metonymy, synecdoche, and irony serve to correct the naivete of metaphor: “The prerogative of the four basic tropes of classical rhetoric is that they offer a variety of figures of discourse for this work of prefiguration and hence preserve the richness of the historical object both by the equivocity proper to each trope and by the multiplicity of figures available.”19 There are, of course, many taxonomies of rhetorical figures, some, like White’s, fourfold, others more inclusive, and one could quibble with the way he understands individual figures. However, what is crucial to retain is White’s insight that the figurative operation underlies the historian’s organization of the historical field; it is the motor that drives narrative understanding.</p>
                <p>Ricoeur draws an emphatic conclusion from his analysis of White’s theory of tropes: “Rhetoric governs the description of the historical field just as logic governs argument that has an explanatory value.”20 The statement is categorical, but Ricoeur imposes conditions. First, the principle of the Analogous cannot be detached from the work of the Same and the Other, which are essential to accounting for the temporality of history—the having-been-there:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The past is indeed what, in the first place, has to be reenacted in the mode of identity, but it is no less true, for all that, that it is also what is absent from all our constructions. The Analogous, precisely, is what retains in itself the force of reenactment and of taking a distance, to the extent that being-as is both to be and not to be.”21</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Second, Ricoeur emphasizes the danger involved in holding that the moment of prefiguration in historical narration is a poetic operation like any other in the literary sphere. White’s theory of tropes runs the risk of flattening the distinction between the fictional and the historical by suggesting that history and fiction are both products of the rhetorical imagination. If the specificity of historical consciousness is not to be lost, the historian must hold to the principle of fidelity to the real past that underlies all historical representation. Again, Ricoeur conceptualizes this fidelity as a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">debt</em> the historian owes to the past:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>And their [the historians’] relationship to the past is first of all that of someone with an unpaid debt, in which they represent each of us who are the readers of their work. This idea of a debt, which may appear strange at first sight, seems to me to stand out against the background of an expression common both to painters and historians: They all seek to “render” something, a landscape or a course of events. In this term “to render,” I see the desire to “render its due” to what is and to what once was.22</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Prefiguration in the Historical Film</strong></p>
                <p>If we accept then the formative role of rhetoric in the genesis of historical narratives, is it possible to discern in historical <em class="notranslate" translate="no">films</em> the same process of prefiguration? I believe it is, but I argue that prefiguration in film must take into account two major problems. First, as I attempted to show in Chapter Two, literary and filmic texts operate very differently, particularly because of the difference of their signifiers. To prefigure historical narratives, film has recourse to specific textual strategies that are at least partially determined by film as a medium of communication, its specific capacities as a “language,” and the historical development of its discourses. Second, I argue that the historical voice is not easily conveyed in film and emerges by means of a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">deviation</em> from what I term the normative complex of cinematic codes, that is, the set of basic structures that underpin the classic fiction film. If classic films can be defined by their adherence to a system of codes they use in constructing a text, historical narration is an agency that comes from outside this system and therefore manifests itself as a conspicuous <em class="notranslate" translate="no">work</em> of textual construction. These two problems form an apparent paradox. On the one hand, historical film must take account of the specificity of film “language”; on the other, it departs from the norms of that language as a condition of historical narration and constructs itself as discourse.</p>
                <p>My argument that historical films are discursive in character finds support in the critique of literalism, best expressed in the work of Natalie Zemon Davis and Robert Rosenstone. Literalism is an extreme case of the rhetoric of the Same. Because film is the medium most rich in signs representing our experience of the spatial and temporal realities of the world, the temptation is to call for a work of imitation that is both endless and ultimately inconceivable: the replication of the historical past in all its phenomenological detail. Even with the advice of historians and access to written, visual, and auditory archives of all sorts, film can only hope to reduce the gap between its representations and the literal realities of historical experience. To identify the mission of historical film with the obsession for the absolute fidelity of image and sound is enough to plunge the filmmaker/historian into a vertigo of representation. Considering film’s mimetic function in this literalist way has led skeptical historians to the easy accusation of anachronism: film’s very excess of representation is perforce a betrayal of historical truth. Moreover, as we saw, literary theorists —Gerard Genette and Kate Hamburger, among them—also see in the surfeit of concrete detail a telling sign of fictionalization, one that triggers the skeptic’s question: how do you know?</p>
                <p>Natalie Zemon Davis suggests that it is quite legitimate for the history film to disrupt conventional realism in order to convey doubt, diversity of interpretation, or more abstract historical truths. She critiques the presumed credibility of historical films that use “period props, paintings, location and local people” as marks of authenticity. Such references take on historical meaning, she argues, only if the filmmaker places them in the context of their use and value in a historical period, and such contexts cannot be represented without recourse to more “abstract” modes of communication. “This means,” Davis tells us, “that there is no automatic privileging of the ‘realistic’ or naturalistic film as the mode for representing the past. The symbolic or evidently constructed mode—Bazin’s image film—has its role to play, too, and even a few advantages for showing how past societies work.”23</p>
                <p>Rosenstone begins with an incisive paradox: “On the screen, history must be fictional in order to be true!” The key to the paradox is that cinematic literalism is unthinkable in the historical film: “Yes, film may show us the world, or the surface of part of the world, but it can never provide a literal rendition of events that took place in the past. Can never be an exact replica of what happened.”24Rosenstone makes the point that fictionalization —the creation of characters or events that never existed—does not necessarily vitiate the filmmaker’s historical intentions and may indeed be an instrument for getting at historical truths. However, the more general term he proposes is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">invention</em>, which covers a multitude of discursive strategies films may use to refer to the historical world. To be historical, a discourse of images must learn to approximate the abstractions of written history: “Film, with its need for a specific image, cannot make general statements about revolution or progress. Instead, film must summarize, synthesize, generalize, symbolize—in images.”25</p>
                <p>Rosenstone suggests several “fictional moves” as techniques of historical representation: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Compression, Condensation, Alteration,</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Metaphor. Compression</em> is the dramatic technique of representing a relatively large historical event through relatively short scenes that compact or epitomize it or of representing social groups through specific “fictional” characters (a technique close to what Ann Rigney calls “figures in the crowd”). <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Condensation</em> is a similar figure that applies to written or filmic history: the selection of specific facts from all the archived evidence available to represent the collective experience of large social groups. Both compression and condensation can be characterized as figurative operations on the order of the synecdoche: a part stands for the whole. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alteration</em> —when it operates historically—refers to changes the filmmaker/historian makes to documented historical realities in order to make a larger historical point: lack of fidelity on the literal level leads to discursive truth. Rosenstone’s concept of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">metaphor</em> is less clear but seems to refer to techniques of symbolization in which a specific image or series of images is meant to stand for more abstract statements.</p>
                <p>Before looking at strategies of prefiguration in two films, one a documentary, the other a “fiction” film, I propose examining some of the ways that the historical voice intervenes in the two historical genres.</p>
                <p>We can in fact distinguish two fundamental types of historical films that have quite distinct discursive strategies. The first is the historical documentary, whose defining feature is its reliance on documents— archival images, filmed or recorded testimony, readings of historical texts, contemporary shots of historical settings, interviews with historical witnesses or historians. The second type is the historical film in which the filmmaker reconstructs historical events for the camera using all the resources of mise en scene —actors, settings or sets, costumes— and thus creates a “fictional” doubling in which representation often lacks the most obvious manifestation of the historical trace, audiovisual documents. Let’s first take the case of the historical documentary and the forms of address it uses. If these forms are departures from the language of classic cinema, they have become nonetheless highly codified and routine in the mass of documentary production.</p>
                <p>In compilation documentaries in which the filmmaker uses archival footage or filmed and auditory documents, the historical voice often intervenes in the form of the voice-over commentary or intertitles that perform the same commentative function. This kind of discourse, prevalent in the classic documentary film, has the advantage of exploiting all the resources of verbal language. Written or aural, the voice is able to place documents in a causal sequence of events, generalize from the specific documented case, explicate apparently incongruous or puzzling features of facts or actions, multiply interpretative perspectives, and set up a rhetorical verbal structure that narrates the action and determines how events are to be understood. Frank Capra’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Why</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">We Fight</em> series about World War II serves as a characteristic example of how the spoken voice-over may act as the ventriloquist of history, to use Andre Bazin’s metaphor. In such films, the extradiegetic commentary serves to organize the discourse, producing narrative coherence out of the fragmentary documents, and in the case of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Why We</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fight</em> series, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">creating</em> historical events through a montage of shots that bends history to the demands of propaganda.</p>
                <p>The ubiquitous voice-over commentary characteristic of the classic documentary strikes us as dated in the wake of the transformation of documentary methods known as direct cinema. However, it is surprisingly alive today in run-of-the-mill historical documentaries, as tuning into the History Channel quickly demonstrates. However, such documentaries also use an alternative to the voice-over: the filmed interview with historians, most often in the absence of the interviewer. Such narrations often alternate with the voice-over. Filmed historians do not stand outside the film; in their role as secondary narrators, they form in fact part of its diegesis. However, posited as historical authorities and often shot in their studies surrounded by books, they assume the same authority as the “voice-of-God” commentary and indeed become at moments disembodied voices that float above and explicate the flow of visual documents. Instead of being continuously guided by the voice positioned somewhere “above” the visual documents, the spectator assumes the task of piecing together the discontinuous commentaries into a network of historical interpretation.</p>
                <p>Some historical documentaries rely as much on editing as on verbal commentary. This was particularly true in the silent period in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, when theories of montage were based on a comparison between the ordering of shots and sequencing in language. Films such as Eisenstein’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">October</em> attempted to use montage as an intellectual or conceptual operation, as if film were capable of reproducing the paradigmatic and syntagmatic aspects of verbal language. It seems clearer to us now that this kind of montage is not a linguistic but a rhetorical act. In terms of the compilation documentary, placing archival documents in sequence—especially when they are not tied together as simple, linear narrative—is a figurative operation that reveals the organizing presence of the historical narrator. This kind of editing of historical materials tends to deviate from classic narrative structures —for example, through the choice of conceptual editing patterns —or is selfconsciously expressive in the way it juxtaposes filmed or recorded documents. Esther Shub’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fall of the Romanov Dynasty</em>, which I discuss shortly, is the prototype of this form of historical narration.</p>
                <p>We need to make a distinction between compilation documentaries that rely on historical documents and documentaries that center on the testimony of still-living historical participants or witnesses to historical events. The latter documentaries have a strong autobiographical character, even when they include, as they often do, archival documents. Human memory is open to distortions due to forgetfulness, imaginative reinvention, or simple mendacity. The task of the historical filmmaker is to organize and evaluate the voices of memory, and, as the viewing of examples of “memory” films shows, there are many strategies for doing this. The filmmaker may adopt the critical voice of the historian and express his views in the give-and-take of the interview situation. In the case of the mendacious witness, the filmmaker may confront the witness’s testimony with other testimony that contradicts it or may interpolate historical documents that perform that function. Similarly, the filmmaker may use the commentative power of cinematic devices such as framing or the emphasis of a significant detail. Of course, the filmmaker/historian is often interested in exploring the historical significance of testimony and the relevance of the recounted events to the contemporary world. He often uses the resources of editing to create relationships among the witness’s verbal testimony, archival documents, and realities of the present moment. Marcel Ophuls’s and Claude Lanzmann’s investigative documentaries centered on the perpetrators and survivors of Nazi crimes are perhaps the best known of this historical genre.</p>
                <p>When we turn from documentary to the historical film of mise en scene, we seem to leave behind the constraints of the archival document and embrace dramatic structures that tend to silence the historian’s voice. Indeed, historical films make infrequent use of the voice-over commentary, the testimony of historians or witnesses, or conceptual montage. They seem to espouse a kind of narration that is more “self-sufficient,” as in the fiction film, which gradually weaned itself from the conspicuous forms of narration typical of the so-called primitive period. Filmmakers and spectators have come to share the perception that staged scenes and voice-over commentary belong to two quite different forms of discourse. However, since I have argued that there is no historical film in the absence of the historiographic voice, how does the historian/narrator make himself heard in the textual play of his film?</p>
                <p>Robert Rosenstone recognizes the histiographic voice in films with deviant structures, what he calls “history as experiment.” The experimental film addresses us in ways very different from the so-called realist film and constructs a very different historical world: “Rather than opening a window directly onto the past, it opens a window onto a different way of thinking about the past.”26Mainstream products embrace an unproblematic and morally uplifting narrative, foreground the individual protagonist at the expense of the social group, emotionalize and dramatize events, and render the idea of pastness as the fetishistic attention to “period style” emptied of its historical meaning. Experimental film, by contrast, contests the conventions of classic filmmaking, giving us “works that are analytic, unemotional, distanced, multicausal; historical worlds that are expressionist, surrealist, disjunctive, postmodern; histories that don’t just show the past but also talk about how and what it means to the filmmaker (or to us) today.”<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">27 </strong>In experimental films, we see the signs of the historian/filmmaker’s interventions—in the construction of collective characters, the anachronistic “interpenetration of past and present,” dissolves of “competing voices and images,” Brechtian distancing of the spectator, or the patent artificiality of mise en scene.</p>
                <p>As Rosenstone suggests, the experimental filmmaker works on the signifying structures of film. This work is rhetorical in nature, and its figures can be seen as standing against the seeming “transparency” of mainstream cinematic representations. Let us look at some typical strategies.</p>
                <p>In certain historical films, the voice of history is diegeticized, that is, it appears in the form of dialogue spoken by characters. This type of intervention is less “disruptive” because the spectator is less aware of the shift between “dramatic” and discursive modes. The subterfuge is successful only if the character successfully balances between his diegetic and exegetic functions: he does not offend the audience’s sense of verisimilitude while acting as a stand-in for the historical voice. The character may be an incidental presence whose function is to explicate obscure actions or behaviors or a central protagonist who takes pains to explain situations that are unfamiliar to the spectator but would be tacitly understood by the historical characters. As we saw, Rossellini’s historical films employ these types of diegeticized commentary. In a strategy that is the opposite of this game of concealment, the character may look into the camera and engage in direct address of the audience. Breaking the closed space of the diegesis, the character seems to step forward to meet our look, as if the past were capable of discoursing directly with the present. This paradoxical shift in spectator address is an instance of textual “folding over” that allows the film to emerge as narration and signals the presence of the historiographic voice.</p>
                <p>However, the historiographic voice is most often manifest as the rhetorical operation that organizes the represented world. We have already encountered strategies of prefiguration in the films analyzed in the foregoing chapters. Rossellini’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rise to Power of Louis XIV</em> is an example of a rhetorical structure I have called ironic mise en scene. Irony is the figure in which the meaning of a statement is at least partially refuted by a second, unstated meaning. In ironic mise en scene, the filmmaker stages a representation of historical characters and events while purposefully thwarting the spectator’s ability to believe in them fully. The spectator feels at a distance from such representations because they openly display the inadequacy of the signifiers —actors, costumes, sets—to produce the impression of presence. Ironic mise en scene is an “anti-illusionist” strategy that can take many forms. In the Rossellini example, the actor Jean-Marie Patte’s physiognomy does not correspond to the image of the historical Louis XIV in the public mind, and aspects of his performance deliberately thwart the spectator’s desire to conflate actor and historical character. Another ironic strategy is to choose anachronistic locations or costumes or stage actions in ways that violate the public’s sense of cinematic realism. As we saw in Renoir’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise,</em> the rhetorical work of the historical film can also be based in the notion of the “figure in the crowd”—nearly the definition of one type of synecdoche—in which the individual protagonist embodies the attributes and aspirations of his class. In Renoir’s film, there is a balance between the emblematic and realistic qualities in the construction of characters: on the one hand, they are represented as credible beings accomplishing specific actions; on the other hand, they are invested with iconic qualities that place them in a kind of absolute moral sphere. Renoir resists the static figure out of respect for the cinematic realism that favors the concrete detail. The representational tendency tempers the symbolic one.</p>
                <p>The creation of symbolic representations is a general characteristic of historical discourse in film because these representations offer to a medium defined by its strength as denotation a way of speaking about events in more general or abstract ways. I take symbol in its broadest sense: “a kind of figurative language in which what is shown (normally referring to something material) means, by virtue of some sort of resemblance, suggestion, or association, something <em class="notranslate" translate="no">more</em> or something else (normally immaterial).”28In the following analyses of Esther Shub’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty</em> and Theo Angelopoulos’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Traveling Players</em>, I attempt to show two distinct strategies for constructing such a “figurative language” in film.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Weapons of Irony in Esther Shub’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the Fall of the Romanov Dynasty</em> (1927)</strong></p>
                <p>As film historians recognize, Shub produced in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fall of the Romanov</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dynasty</em> (1927) the first feature-length compilation film made for the most part from preexisting archival footage. The film is a documentary because it makes use of filmed documents, but it is a historical film by dint of its subject and its intentions. Like other historians of the Soviet state, Shub researched her subject in the official and private archives that became available to her after the October Revolution. As historian Jacques Le Goff has observed, archives are always <em class="notranslate" translate="no">monuments</em>: records of the past that are intended to perpetuate the memory of persons and events and always for specific purposes. Archives are most often selective remembrances, organized in the interest of justifying a specific tradition and, in the case of official archives, preserving for the future a heritage of power. Faced with the bias of the historical record, the historian is called on to critique documents in order to reveal the intentions of the archivists, the broader context of the events documented, and the materials and points of view that have been excluded. The historian’s task is not to repeat the assertions of the documentary record but to make the documents speak of the past in ways that were not intended. We can imagine Shub, fervent supporter of the revolution, faced with the official archives that glorify the regime of the czar and private archives that extol the life of the ruling classes. Her problem was to construct a revolutionary vision of history based exclusively on archival material that was largely dedicated to the preservation of the reactionary regime and its privileged elite. The question, then, is how does Shub prefigure these materials in a film intended to evoke, in Marxist terms, the historic necessity of the October Revolution?</p>
                <p>I propose the following response. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fall of the Romanov</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dynasty</em>, Shub prefigures her narrative by choosing two basic figurative operations: antithesis and irony. This is not to say that other figures are not discernible in this text that has a distinct rhetorical character, notably synecdoche, which is one of the inescapable structures of historical representation in film. It is easy to understand why antithesis is essential to the development of the deep structure of the film. Roland Barthes’s description of the figure is particularly relevant here: “the battle between two plenitudes set ritually face to face like two fully armed warriors.”<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">29 </strong>The metaphor Barthes chooses is quite apt because Shub’s film concerns the class struggle that opposes two implacable entities: the Romanov regime and the social classes and institutions that are in solidarity with it versus the exploited masses —the peasantry, the proletariat, the army. Beginning with the macrolevel of the narrative, it is obvious that the figure of antithesis plays a central role in the construction of the film’s scenario. The entire preparation for the “final struggle,” which takes up more than half the film’s length, positions the combatants in opposition to each other, very often through a simple structure of alternating sequences in which Shub juxtaposes the conditions of oppressor and oppressed. The same structure of antithesis operates <em class="notranslate" translate="no">within</em> many sequences constructed according to the ideological opposition inherent in parallel editing. Shub opposes, on the basis of contrasting motifs, representatives of the old regime and the social classes subjected to its rule.</p>
                <p>Antithesis operates, then, as the basic figure of the film’s dramatic construction. The long sequences of exposition establish the oppositional posture of the combatants; the miseries of war then awaken the revolutionary masses to their situation; and their new class consciousness explodes in the revolutionary violence of October. However, there is a second rhetorical figure that plays an essential role in the textuality of the film. As we have seen, irony is the ambivalent figure that simultaneously asserts and denies. Shub the revolutionary historian finds herself in a parodoxical relationship with the archives she intends to exploit. They are what exists in terms of filmic testimony on the nature of the Romanov regime—there were no revolutionary documentarists before the revolution offering alternative visions of social classes in Russia. Shub must use the archival material even though it seems, on the face of it, antagonistic to her aims. She engages therefore in a critique of documents intended to force the lying image to speak the truth. Irony is the arm of criticism since it allows the images to assert themselves while subverting the message they were intended to communicate.</p>
                <p>First, irony pierces in the film’s intertitles. Through the tone they adopt and the sarcasm of quotation marks, Shub attacks the obtuseness of the images and makes them reveal what they prefer to hide. Let’s take the example of a shot representing, toward the end of the Russian involvement in the Great War, frontline soldiers in their trenches receiving the visit of a procession of priests who sprinkle them with holy water as they pass. The bite of the intertitle that follows strips the image of its innocence: “The ‘holy fathers’ tried to prop up the troops’ fighting ability with ‘the word of Christ.’” Irony also surfaces in numerous passages in which Shub uses the intertitle to point out the false consciousness of the exploited masses. In these cases, the image presents the worker, the peasant, the soldier engaged in activities whose meaning they misapprehend, preceded by the discursive intertitle that glosses the image in advance. The following example of paired images and commentary, taken from the long sequences representing preparations for war, is typical in this regard:</p>
                <p>Intertitle: “Those who will be led to the carnage”</p>
                <p>Image: Shot showing workers in a factory</p>
                <p>Intertitle: “The hands of the workers prepare the death of their brothers.”</p>
                <p>Image: Shot showing proletarians working in a munitions factory.</p>
                <p>In this example, as elsewhere, intertitles have an exegetic function and produce a combined linguistic/visual statement that is ironic in nature. However, Shub’s discursive intervention is not always so heavy and pointed. As one of the great editors of the Soviet silent period, she seems to prefer, when possible, to make the image speak by means of the ordering of shots. Editing is her chosen instrument of critique. The following extract from the film shows clearly how irony functions at the level of the organization of the image track. This is an example of a parallel sequence based on the ideological opposition of oppressor/oppressed. We reencounter here, of course, the familiar figure of antithesis.</p>
                <p>1. Intertitle: “The czarist governors ruled over the countryside.”</p>
                <p>2. Intertitle: “The peace and tranquility of provincial cities.”</p>
                <p>3. Images: Three shots representing the ease and richness of life for the privileged. (Motif A)</p>
                <p>4. Intertitle: “The lands of the great property owners covered enormous spaces.”</p>
                <p>5. Image: Very long pan (right to left) showing the wealth and extent of the domain. (Motif A)</p>
                <p>6. Intertitle: “And next to them, villages bereft of land and plunged into poverty.”</p>
                <p>7. Image: Very long pan (left to right) showing a village and women drawing water from the communal well. (Motif B)</p>
                <p>8. Intertitle: “The landowners. The governor of Kaluga.”</p>
                <p>9. Images: Three shots representing the governor and his wife, accompanied by their dog, descending the monumental staircase of their mansion; a pond full of ducks and swans ornamented by the play of a fountain; a spacious terrain into which the couple penetrates. (Motif A)</p>
                <p>10. Intertitle: “The peasants work under the yoke of the owners’ land.”</p>
                <p>11. Image: A shot of peasant women harvesting wheat. (Motif B)</p>
                <p>12. Images: Three shots showing the governor and his wife taking coffee in the garden; a vast landscape with a herd of cattle; the couple rising and leaving the garden and the domestics arriving to clear the table. (Motif A, although Motif B returns within the third shot in the contrast between master and servant.)</p>
                <p>13. Image: Shot of harvest time and peasant labor. (Motif B)</p>
                <p>After the long sequence at the beginning of the film in which Shub inventories the groups that make up the old regime in Moscow —nobility, big landowners, bourgeois, priests —she refers us to the countryside, second place of oppression. The irony of the look —and of the voice—is already established. As in most parallel sequences, there are two series of motifs, identified above as motif A and motif B. Motif A refers to all the shots or groups of shots that represent the richness of the land and the ease of life in the countryside where the governors rule: 3, 5, 9, and 12. Motif B refers to the shots that represent the corresponding misery of the peasantry: 7, 11, and 13. The fourth visual shot of the sequence (number 5 above) illustrates the intertitle that precedes it: the enormous spaces of the land controlled by the governor that we discover in the sweep of the panning camera. In response to the shot of land wealth, there is a second sweeping pan, but this time of a village “bereft of land and plunged in poverty.” However, the shot appears to have a strong aesthetic character, suggesting not so much the misery of village life but its picturesqueness, a reading that Shub seeks to undermine by the parallel she constructs between the shots. The false likeness is already established in the juxtaposition of the motifs (space of the rich versus space of the poor) that the camera movements, parallel but juxtaposed, underscore: right to left in the first, left to right in the second. The intertitle provides the metonymic shock, “Next to them<em class="notranslate" translate="no">,</em> the villages bereft of land and plunged into poverty”: these two contradictory spaces are in fact contiguous.</p>
                <p>Shub focuses then on a specific great landowner, the governor of Kaluga. The first group of shots (motif A, number 9 above) shows the governor and his wife making the rounds of their property: the couple, accompanied by their dog, descends the monumental staircase in front of their mansion; ducks and swans swim about in a pond ornamented by the play of a fountain; the couple emerges into a descriptive shot representing the richness of their land. There are so many images of the wealth of the governor, signifiers of his social position and power. A single shot (motif B, number 11) shows us peasant women harvesting wheat. The second group of shots (motif A, number 12) shows us the governor and his wife taking their coffee in the garden. A second shot of a landscape with a large herd of cattle evokes their excessive wealth. In the third, we rediscover the couple getting up from the table and disappearing offscreen as their servants come to clear the table. The motif of domestic labor, which was to signify again the wealth of the governor, is linked, through an ironic reading, to motif B, which asserts itself in the final image of the sequence representing the harsh productive labor of the peasantry.</p>
                <p>The rhetorical work that is everywhere visible in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fall of the</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Romanov Dynasty</em> stems from the relationship between Shub the historian and the archival material she exploits. Shub’s voice ceaselessly intervenes through, either verbal language or the “language” of editing, to correct what the visual record has left as vestiges of the old regime. From her superior position of historical distance and enlightened class consciousness, she imposes the revolutionary vision of the present and realigns the images of the past in terms of the culminating event that makes sense of it all. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty</em> is certainly more heavily rhetorical than most historical films, and the marks of enunciation that signal the presence of revolutionary consciousness, the voice that undercuts and restructures, emerge from the fundamental irony of its historical position.</p>
                <p>In analyzing Theo Angelopoulos’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em>, we deal with the kind of historical film generally recognized as such by the public and film scholars. Unlike Shub’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Traveling Players</em> does not make use of preexisting visual documents. It relies, rather, on the imitation of events by means of mise en scene. The filmmaker selects a location or constructs a set, brings the actors before the camera, rehearses their actions, dresses the set and the actors, chooses the lighting, and so forth. He also establishes camera angle, distance, and camera movement —what Andre Gaudreault calls the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise en cadre</em>, all the work of organizing the visual field within the frame to achieve particular effects. The organization of materials through mise en scene also leads to much greater control at the stage of editing the images and sounds. The filmmaker is not limited to preexisting footage, which can only be cut or intercut, never amended or reshaped. Rather, he has chosen the materials he shoots and fashioned the shots in terms of their eventual montage.</p>
                <p>It is this sense of mastery and overt manipulation that seems to distress historians. It’s one thing, a historian recently told me, to talk about the compilation film that uses documentary footage, although this is in itself no guarantee of a film’s historical character. It’s quite another to consider a film historical that includes no archival material at all and mimics historical events using the techniques of the fiction film. This commonsense position considers the indexical character of the cinematic sign—its real relation to what it represents, as Pierce describes the index—as the guarantor, in the manner of the barometer or the weathervane, of the authenticity of the documentary image. As Martine Joly observes, “If we admit that the strength of the image is linked to its historically dominant character as index, we can understand that we expect from it the strength and the authenticity of the real from which it is taken.”30 The indexical property of the cinematic sign lends it a factual character, but in films of mise en scene, this factuality, Marc Ferro argues in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinema and History</em>,31 applies to the image only insofar as it bears witness to the film’s production: the persons and objects brought before the camera, the locations or sets where they are filmed, and so on. When a historical film is staged, where is one to locate historical facts, those intractable givens of any historic discourse? Referential constraints seem to all but disappear as the filmmaker imagines a concrete diegetic world that he paradoxically asserts really existed. For the historian, the being-there of the imagined diegetic world—the very realism of its presence—overwhelms the more elusive and intangible having-been-there of the past.</p>
                <p>Now it is important not to succumb to the temptation to reduce the cinematic sign to its indexical aspect, what historians consider its “documentary” value. As in all films, the indexical sign in historical films establishes an existential relationship between the cinematic image and its immediate referent—the materials that the camera films. However, the rhetorical work that proposes a relationship of analogy between the film’s audiovisual discourse and the reality of the past necessarily involves an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">iconic</em> activity of reference. I use icon in the Piercean sense of a sign that refers to a denoted object through analogy: “Finally, the icon is that which exhibits the same quality, or the same configuration of qualities, that the denoted object exhibits.”32Fiction films produce the iconic representation of imaginary worlds that exist in the mind of the spectator and nowhere else. Historical films also construct iconic representations in the mind of the spectator, but the spectator takes these representations as references to a world of the past. In the iconic sign, the denoted object is not the materials that the film records but the historical past to which the film refers. As Oswald Ducrot and Tzvetan Todorov describe it, the icon does not establish a simple relationship of resemblance (here, between the audiovisual materials and the reality of the past). The film cannot represent the past by substituting for it a savant imitation. In rhetorical terms, Ducrot and Todorov tell us, “the icon is a synecdoche rather than a metaphor”;<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">33 </strong>it is the part substituted for the whole. The historical film creates a reductive and partial representation that stands for the broad field of events to which it refers.</p>
                <p>Denotation in the historical film operates, then, at two distinct levels. The spectator “reads” the images indexically as representations of the “realities” that the film records in the process of shooting. This reading is a process of “recognition” that appears “automatic” and immediate: we recognize persons, objects, movement, spatial depth, and so forth. The second level of denotation is iconic in nature and is constructed on the first. Here, the process of recognition is not automatic or immediate but requires an intellectual reading. Having recognized the audiovisual field the film literally represents, the spectator is asked to interpret the relationship between the first level of denotation and the ultimate referent of the film: the past that it can represent only indirectly and through a process of intellection. We now examine in some detail how this process of iconic figuration takes place in a specific historical film of mise en scene.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: The Degradation of Tragedy in Theo Angelopoulos’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the Traveling Players</em> (1974–1975)</strong></p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em> belongs to a trilogy of films (with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Days of’36</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunters</em>) that Angelopoulos made on the history of Greece from the Metaxas dictatorship to the end of the dictatorship of the colonels (1936–74). This series of history films is among the most important and innovative in cinema.</p>
                <p>Angelopoulos refers to “The Traveling Players” as “a voyage in time and space” intended to document the period between 1939 and 1952, during which Greece endured a “series of occupations.”34As the film opens, we see the proscenium curtain of a theater. An old actor emerges and addresses the spectators (of the play, of the film) in the following words: “The Play you are about to see in five acts is Spyridon Peresiades’s immortal idyll ‘Golfo the Shepherdess.’” The spectator soon becomes aware of the irony of this speech. We will never see the five acts of “Golfo,” whose performance is repeatedly interrupted by historical events, but we will witness the five acts of a historical drama as refracted through the backstage existence of a troupe of ambulant thespians.</p>
                <p>Although the film does not organize events into acts, it does treat the following moments of Greek history. (a) The Metaxas dictatorship flirts with fascism in the late 1930s, before Greece, dependent on Britain financially, enters into World War II on the side of the Allies. (b) The Germans occupy Greece beginning in 1940 and are met by the forces of resistance led by the Communist Party (the National Liberation Front) and its military arm, the People’s Liberation Army. (c) As liberation approaches in 1944, all parties agree to a Government of National Unity, which was to include the National Liberation Front. However, British General Scobie, head of the occupying forces, orders the People’s Liberation Army disarmed. Protests result in bloodshed and the two month Battle of Athens. The Varkiza agreement ends the conflict with promises of amnesty and representation for the resistance, promises that are not kept. Many members of the National Liberation Front return to the hills to regroup as a guerrilla army. The British force the “disgraceful parody” of an election that legalizes a “monarcho-fascist” regime (1946). (d) The Civil War begins in 1946 pitting the army of occupation and the Greek right wing against the nationalist guerrilla army. In 1947, at the British request, President Truman agrees to participate in the Greek occupation. The People’s Army ultimately acknowledges defeat in 1949. (e) Anticommunist fighter Marshall Papagos is elected president in 1952. American influence in Greece is consolidated as the Cold War begins.</p>
                <p>In the general lines of the film’s scenario, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em> takes up these periods in their linear progression. However, the film is well known for the disconcerting freedom with which it treats historical chronology. Even more disturbing is the way it violates what we presume to be the temporal continuity of shots, so that an apparently continuous sequence of shots may represent two historical periods separated in time. Angelopoulos describes this strategy as a dialectical exchange between “two historical times,” a comparative structure that leads to “historical conclusions.” He is not interested in replicating events in a simple chain of cause and effect; rather, his representation of events is intended as an analytic interpretation of history. Therefore, he disengages events from their linear sequence to resituate them in the present of discourse: “Those links [between historical times] do not level events but bypass the notions of past/present and instead provide a linear developmental interpretation which exists only in the present.”35The asequential ordering Angelopoulos chooses at these moments seems in part rooted in his analysis of the circularity of this period in Greek history: the repetitive cycles of occupation from which Greece seems unable to extricate itself.</p>
                <p>Let’s take the example of the film’s first three sequences in which we are introduced to the troupe of actors in relationship to whom the situations and events of Greek history are presented. The first sequence is made up of a single long take and gives us a distant view of the traveling players, aligned across the screen with their luggage, moving slowly from the train station in the background toward the camera as one of the actors’ offscreen voice comments: “In the fall of 1952 we returned to Aegion. We were tired and hadn’t slept for two days.” In the next sequence, we see the troupe approaching the camera in a street hung with banners proclaiming the candidacy for president of Marshall Paragos, the anticommunist fighter. A voice from a loudspeaker, which emanates, we soon become aware, from a primitive sound truck, broadcasts Paragos’s political slogans. As we learn only retrospectively, we have entered the film’s narrative at what is to be its final moment. In the third sequence, we are again in a street in Aegios approaching a square that will become a familiar place of historical action in the film. The troupe leader emerges into the frame from behind the tracking camera, followed by the other players. The visual cues seem to establish the temporal continuity and the spatial contiguity between this take and the previous two, although a closer examination of the figures reveals that the composition of the troupe has changed: its leader is not the same, a young boy has appeared, and the players carry different burdens. An offscreen voice, soon to be identified as that of a man walking his bicycle into the town square, marks the historical shift: “Tomorrow afternoon the Minister of Propaganda of the Third Reich, Goebbels, accompanied by Ioanis Metaxas, our National Leader, will pass through our town on his way to ancient Olympus.” We find ourselves at the chronological beginning of the film’s fabula, 1939.</p>
                <p>This particular emplotment of events calls for several observations. First, narratologists call this kind of sequencing a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">prolepsis</em> or anticipation of events because the order of the telling does not correspond to the order of the events in their linear progression. We leap forward in time while the film has not yet made reference to chronologically earlier actions. Such movements in time are quite common in historical narratives, and it is not unusual for the historian to begin with the narrative’s final moment (the effect to be elucidated) in order to link it with the situations in which it takes root. Angelopoulos, who is not constrained by the methods of written history, does not immediately make clear the meaning of the juxtaposition of two historical moments. However, the sequence of the telling suggests a retrospective, synoptic vision (Mink) of historical events in which the actions that are still to be narrated are already invested with their narrative finality. Indeed, the Greek audiences who flocked to see <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Players</em> as it was released after the fall of the dictatorship of the colonels certainly had the impression of already <em class="notranslate" translate="no">having followed</em> the story and were doubtless sensitive to the irony of this deliberate confusion of chronology. In this sense, we can call Angelopoulos’s historical view fatalistic: the sequence of historical actions loses the sense of contingency; the end exists, quite literally, already in the beginning.</p>
                <p>At several other moments in the film, Angelopoulos suggests the circularity of events in this period through the interpolation of unmotivated flash-forwards or flashbacks in the progression of events. As the troupe’s leader in 1940 prepares to depart to battle the advancing Italian army, we return briefly and without transition to the election of 1952 and the recognizable motifs of the second sequence: the sound truck and the scattering leaflets. The interpolation is not gratuitous but suggests the irony of this period of Greek history: the tragic failure of initiatives of national defense and liberation that all end in events like the rigged election of 1952. The final ironic reversal of chronology occurs in the last shot sequence of the film: we return to the train station of the film’s first sequence, to the players and their luggage aligned in long shot, and we hear the offscreen commentary voiced by one of the actors. The traveling players, tired and sleep deprived, return to Aegion, but this time the date is 1939. As <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em> opens with the fabula’s concluding moment, the film closes with the event that is its chronological beginning.</p>
                <p>Returning to the first three sequences of the film that I described in narrative terms, let’s examine the rhetorical operations those sequences involve. The visual signs of continuity suggest that sequence three is elliptically related to sequence two through an apparent match on movement: a 180-degree shift in angle represents by ellipsis (a brief jump in time) a second view of the trajectory of the players through the streets of Aegion. These visual clues of continuity are shortly contradicted by the voice that stipulates in effect, “This is not 1952, this is 1939.” However, the authority of the voice is partially undermined by its mise en scene: How can this ostensible public proclamation emanate from a man idly pushing his bicycle across a deserted square? And where is the public to whom the voice is addressed? This lack of verisimilitude already suggests, as it does elsewhere in the film, that we are dealing with a space that is as rhetorical as it is real. It is this space of the town square that will be the locus of many of the film’s representations of collective historical action. In the next sequence, for example, it will be the site for the drill by Greek fascist militia.</p>
                <p>I would suggest that Angelopoulos’s figurative strategy consists in the following. The realistic representation of place and the apparent continuity of action serve as the ground (in the rhetorical lexicon, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tertium comparationis</em>) against which the terms of the figure are cut. Here, we are not dealing with the classical trope or ornaments of discourse; we are dealing with rhetorical operations. The two terms to be compared—the fascist-leaning Metaxis dictatorship and the regime of anticommunist Marshal Papagos at the beginning of the Cold War—meet on the chain of discourse, and their presence together is justified by the codes of cinematic representation that anchor them in the “same” space and time, even if we acknowledge retrospectively that the codes have led us astray. The emerging awareness of the disparity of the historical moments bring the realization that we cannot “understand” the sequence in terms of the “literal” continuity the film seems to construct. Instead, we are led to search out the features of comparison that will reveal the underlying meaning that cannot be determined in terms of narrative logic (the sequence is not in fact sequential) or the spectator’s experience (different moments in time cannot normally be conflated in this way). One might at first assume that the figure that binds the elements together is a metonymy: the two historical moments can substitute for each other, can be compared and “equated,” because of their physical proximity to each other in the space of the scene. However, the two historical moments do not coexist in a referential space; as Angelopoulos clearly indicates, they are brought together only on the chain of discourse. We are therefore dealing with a metaphor, or more properly a metaphoric operation, that establishes an unanticipated resemblance between the two apparently disparate elements.</p>
                <p>A similar rhetorical strategy can be seen in the film’s telescoping of narrative action in which successive historical events are represented as occurring within a single long take. The work of extreme condensation, this paradoxical mode of representation, reveals “a basic doubleness of meaning between what is meant and what is said (the tenor and the vehicle).”36 Thus, the long takes suggest the continuous development of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</em>, in which screen time and story time are taken to be the same (the vehicle, what is said), whereas the spectator understands the long take as an elliptical representation of a much longer duration (the tenor, what is meant).</p>
                <p>Let’s take the example of the dance hall sequence, which follows a reference to the “disgraceful parody” of elections that legitimate a “monarcho-fascist regime” (March 1946). Elektra, stalwart sister of partisan soldier Orestes, enters the dance hall. We learn from a banner stretched across the wall above the band that it is New Year’s Eve 1946. The customers are divided between the anticommunist thugs and the sympathizers of the People’s Army. A song duel ensues between the groups in which the fascists mock the flight of the People’s Army and call for the return of the king, while the rebels sing of their lack of fear for the Scobie regime and their belief in the power of the people. After the confrontation, the fascists, all males, triumphant but isolated, dance with each other. Elektra crosses the dance hall and remains standing to the side of the band. She then exits through a back door and is joined by the troupe’s old accordionist, whom we have seen as part of the dance hall band. Elektra says to the old actor: “Orestes has turned in his arms. The war is over.” But 1946 is just the beginning of the civil war that will end in 1949. This heavily condensed representation of the civil war is symbolic in character. If the combative groups in the dance hall stand for the ideological battles of the period, Elektra is the emblematic figure of the tragic denouement; her demeanor from the beginning of the sequence suggests the defeat of 1949.</p>
                <p>The next shot sequence appears to take place in the early morning hours as the drunken anticommunists, having left the dance hall, stagger down the street singing right-wing songs (preceded by a tracking camera). Again, the continuity of the duration of action is contradicted by the development of the thugs’ actions. The group of men twice crosses the street. With each shift in position, the group becomes more organized until the thugs form a militia marching in lockstep. They emerge onto the square, where a loudspeaker disseminates a political speech, and as the camera pans to show us the speaker and his party aligned on a balcony, we realize that time has shifted once again to the Papagos election in 1952. The shot sequence has condensed the period 1949 to 1952, representing the growing ascendancy of the monarcho-fascists after the civil war, through a synecdoche, the figure in which a part stands for the whole.</p>
                <p>Angelopoulos is one of the great poets of modern cinema, known for his unusual use of imagery. Cinema is the medium richest in signifiers of the real, and the cinematic image can be characterized by the ease with which it denotes real experience. Imagery, however, suggests more than pure denotation; it has special resonance because of the way in which the work, cinematic or literary, calls attention to it. An image can become imagery because of its repetition or, in cinema, because of the way it is emphasized through framing, lighting, or color or the way it detaches itself from other denoted objects in a film. Imagery is the effect, then, of another “doubleness” in which the denotative meaning is invested with meaning at another, symbolic level. In Angelopoulos’s work, imagery appears to emerge from the “real” world he represents, but some aspect of its representation, its mise en scene, associates it with the world of the uncanny.</p>
                <p>We see in his imagery the hand of the artist who pushes the image into the foreground of our awareness. Many striking examples in others of Angelopoulos’s films come to mind: the giant sculpted hand suspended over the sea by a helicopter in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Landscape in the Mist</em>, or in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eternity and a Day</em> the image of men in iridescent yellow slickers riding bicycles through a dark, rain-drenched landscape, or the refugees hung like ciphers on the wire fence at the border protecting Greece from the poorer Balkan states. Such images have a figurative dimension because they appear not so much as visual observation, but as part of a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">vision</em> that must be accounted for in symbolic terms. The tension of Angelopoulos’s imagery derives from the fact that its symbolic meaning often seems elusive and escapes immediate understanding. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em> is full of strong imagery, but while it retains considerable ambiguity, its symbolic intent is clear: to characterize, especially in political terms, the meaning of large historical events.</p>
                <p>Let’s look at an example. Angelopoulos chooses to represent the Varkiya agreement (crafted by the British occupiers and the Greek right wing) through a series of striking images. The power of the occupying forces is rendered as a pompous architectural structure, open in the center and guarded by armed soldiers of the state, its forbidding character suggested by imposing long shots. A voice from a loudspeaker (a metaphoric representation of a distant, disembodied authority) announces the end of the civil war and asserts the benevolent British concern for the future of Greece. A symmetrical 180-degree change of angle reasserts the setting’s crushing institutional structure. The loudspeaker announces the articles of protocol: the free expression of political convictions, the abolition of repressive laws, the disbanding of the People’s Army, and the conditions of amnesty for the rebel forces. In startling contrast, we see the arrival on horseback of a long line of bedraggled soldiers from the People’s Army, who one by one depose their arms in the center of this symbolic space. Their vulnerability and humanness stand in rhetorical opposition to the power that debases them.</p>
                <p>I would like to consider one last aspect of the rhetoric of reference that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em> uses: the troupe of actors. Dressed in dark clothing, the players appear at first as an undifferentiated group, at the train station, for example, where the long shot avoids any individuation. Moving in unison through the streets, they seem visually separate from the events that seem to overwhelm them. However, distinctions do emerge based on the positions that the central characters adopt in relation to historical developments. Certain actors leave to fight in the theaters of war and become subjects of historical action. The father and troupe leader, a national patriot, enlists in the Greek army and leaves for the front and the antifascist fight. In his absence, his wife consorts openly with her lover, and the father is eventually betrayed by the adulterous couple. Orestes, his son, is a member of a Marxist formation, and the film devotes three sequences to presenting the group’s political ideology and its analysis of revolutionary conditions. Orestes, like his father, leaves the troupe to join the People’s Army in the resistance and then in the Civil War. Orestes’s two sisters, Elektra and Chrysothaeme, are foils to each other. Elektra is the implacable representative of political consciousness and personal fidelity. She stands for her father and for Orestes amid the passivity and opportunism of the other actors. She keeps company with the rebel forces, protects her brother and his Marxist comrades, speaks directly into the camera about the British betrayal of Greece, and participates with other militants in the Battle of Athens. Chrysothaeme is a “survivor”: she compromises her Greekness, plays the exhibitionist for a masturbator who rewards her with a bottle of oil, consorts with the British occupiers, and marries an American soldier.</p>
                <p>The film never follows the protagonists of action into the fields of battle. We remain, rather, with the troupe itself as it wanders from place to place, from performance to performance, staging and restaging its irrelevant pastoral tragedy. Objects rather than subjects of action, the traveling players are inconsequential victims of history. As the civil war is represented in the village of Aegion as a stylized skirmish between opposing forces, the troupe moves surreptitiously through the streets, avoiding an encounter with either army. Always off center, on the periphery of meaningful events, the actors do a “command performance” of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Golfo</em> on a beach for members of the British occupying force until they are interrupted by guerrilla gunfire.</p>
                <p>As several characters’ names suggest, Angelopoulos has quite literally emplotted the film on the model of the Oresteia. Why this choice? In an interview, Angelopoulos gave the following explanation: “Greek people have grown up caressing dead stones. I’ve tried to bring mythology down from the heights and directly to the people.”37However, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Traveling Players</em> is something more than the transposition of Greek tragedy into a narrative about relatively recent Greek history. The film works on a trope, to use Hayden White’s language: the Oresteia prefigures the field of history the film seeks to represent. Although the reworking of modern Greek history in terms of a mythological story is an audacious mixture of the fictional and the historical, the seriousness of intent in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em> is not in the slightest undermined.</p>
                <p>On the contrary, Angelopoulos establishes a deep structural relationship between mythological and historical events. The spectator — the Greek spectator in particular —becomes involved in a comparative reading. There is first the overlay of the dramatis personnae. As the characters’ names and the course of the action make clear, the internal drama of the troupe replicates, models itself on the Oresteian tragedy. As the father (the Agamemnon figure) leaves for war, his wife (the Clytemnestra figure) mocks his patriotism and moves in with her lover (the Aesgisthus figure), a fascist sympathizer, who usurps the leadership role in the troupe. Although the father is betrayed but not murdered by the adulterous couple, Orestes, encouraged and abetted by Elektra, kills his mother and her lover while they are performing on stage in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Golfo</em>. As in Greek legend, the crime of Clytemnestra and Aesgisthus is on the one hand personal —the sexual betrayal of Agamemnon; on the other, the crime is one of “lese majesty” against the authority of the father while he is away waging a patriotic war. Indeed, it is the cringing opportunism of the Aesgisthus figure that defines his treacherous character: he is not ennobled by patriotic feeling; rather, he is drawn to fascism as a rising force, fingers the “Englishman” the troupe is hiding, and attempts to save himself from the Nazis who arrest the players (“Me, comrade,” he pleads in pidgin German).</p>
                <p>The constellation of characters mirrors that of the Oresteia, but it is, of course, a distorting mirror. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling Players</em>, the royal family of murderous intent and bloody revenge is reset in the marginal world of ambulant actors. Aegisthus consorts with Clytemnestra in the seedy room of an inn. Agamemnon leaves for the patriotic war as a humble volunteer. Even Orestes’s murder of his mother and her lover takes place within the proscenium arch of a shoddy theater. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Traveling</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Players</em> has therefore something of the classical genre the French call the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">burlesque</em>, in which noble characters are played as rabble. Indeed, the mixture of high and low permeates the film’s representation of serious events and establishes an ambivalent rhetoric based on metaphor (Angelopoulos’s characters and their actions are <em class="notranslate" translate="no">likened</em> to these mythological figures and actions) and irony (how <em class="notranslate" translate="no">unlike</em> are the stations and the deeds of these characters in relation to their mythological counterparts). Similarly, Angelopoulos sets up a disparity between the seriousness of the historical actions to which he refers and the way he represents them. This rhetorical dissonance is infused with irony and sets us at a distance from the events the film references. Thus, the political positions of the combatants in the Civil War are represented in terms of a song duel in a cabaret; the misery of the Greek population during the fascist occupation is evoked by the troupe’s comic pursuit of a chicken across a field of snow; the nearly farcical celebration of Elektra’s sister’s marriage to an American soldier on a beach stands for American domination of Greek culture in the early 1950s.</p>
                <p>However, the film is not so much playful as it is bitterly ironic: this degradation of tragedy does not eliminate the peril experienced by the characters or the real consequences of historical action for the Greek world of the period. Indeed, the momentous events of history continue to reach the scene of representation even if they are “defused” by comic distancing, subjected to a heavily rhetorical mise en scene, or relayed through the account of a secondary narrator, as are the offstage scenes of horrific events in tragic theater. The People’s Army soldier (the Pylades figure) who recounts the torture of political prisoners under the government of “reconciliation” does not speak within the frame of a closed narrative world (the single long take shows us no interlocutor); rather, he directly addresses the spectator. This direct address demolishes verisimilitude—the scene does not conform to expectations of “realism”—and establishes a dialogic link between the (Greek) spectator in the present and the representation of his immediate historical past. The overwhelming response to the film (made under the dictatorship but released during the transition to democracy) demonstrates to what extent the Greek public recognized through Angelopoulos’s strategies of representation the events that shaped their contemporary reality.</p>
