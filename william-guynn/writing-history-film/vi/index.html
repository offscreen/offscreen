                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Film As an Instrument of Public Memory</strong></p>
                <p>This section of my study takes up the question of the role of historical films in managing collective memory. Film—and other “nonprofessional” forms of social remembrance in television, journalism, and the popular press—have not been welcomed by the ranks of academic historians, who have often complained about the media’s lack of method and training and their tendency to sacrifice truth to drama and emotion. However, the importance of cinema in this social endeavor is undeniable. Indeed, historians acknowledge that filmic representation has such power that it overwhelms other forms of recollection by imposing indelible images of the past on the public imagination. They are at a loss in their efforts to combat and correct what they consider erroneous but compelling representations. Historical “fictions,” they argue, tend to replace the real documents of events in the public imagination. Marc Ferro laments in an article from 1987: “Are not the images of the Revolution of 1905 which dominate our memory those from Eisenstein’s work [in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Battleship Potemkin</em>]?”1</p>
                <p>In the domain of the historical documentary, the situation is different, but similar concerns remain. Documentary footage taken of historical events is necessarily fragmentary. The filmmaker has chosen— or circumstances have obliged him—to film only certain events, from certain angles and for certain durations, for reasons that are technical, logistical, or ideological; editing, whether by filmmaker, producer, or sponsor, further reduces and shapes the material destined for public consumption. Yet these fractional and often tendentious representations tend to impose a set of images that is, in the public mind, the essential imagery of events. This is particularly true of the broadcast media, which can operate to the detriment of public memory. Film and television often undermine the collective task of remembering by ceaselessly repeating fetish images of past events: what the media have “captured” on film or video tends to overshadow and replace all other recollection. Anton Kaes contends that “the mass media have become the most effective (and least acknowledged) institutional vehicles for shaping historical consciousness.”2</p>
                <p>The danger is very real and concerns the general tendency in the era of simulation to offer the public packaged substitutes for the act of reminiscence. The Vietnam War, for example, subjected to intense coverage by the media, particularly television, survives in the public imagination in the form of highly selective and distilled images that, once “captured,” are manipulated and repeated. Kaes makes a similar analysis of the “memory” of the Third Reich:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>It is a memory consisting largely of images that have by now become so conventionalized that they determine what is a “correct” representation of the period and what is not. Images of Hitler or of the war have engraved themselves so indelibly on the public consciousness that new images are hard to imagine. Thus history films increasingly replace not only historical experience but also historical imagination.3</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>However, Kaes points out that the New German Cinema produced history films whose aim was not only to reconstruct the past but also to “jog the memory of the living”: “They provide alternative ways of seeing with their self-reflexive narrative and visual style, their refusal for the most part to recycle endlessly repeated and cliched images of the Third Reich.”4</p>
                <p>It would be a mistake to overemphasize the negative impact of the media. If media-packaged events tend to undermine the human responsibility to remember, the media are also, potentially and in reality, capable of stimulating enormous public discussion of collective concerns. In the sphere of history, we could cite the many films or television programs that have served as catalysts to remembering and have brought about a public reflection on the realities of the past and their meaning. One need only think of the social impact of historical documentaries like Alain Resnais’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Night and Fog</em> or Marcel Ophuls’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Chagrin et la Pitié</em> or “fictions” like Fassbinder’s ambitious filmic retelling of the history of Germany in the twentieth century. And one can even quote Ferro himself to contradict his negative assessment of historical fiction. In an article that appeared just two years after the one just cited, Ferro seems mystified by what he calls the “Potemkin paradox”: “How is it possible that this film, better than any historical work, erudite or critical, succeeds in evoking admirably a revolutionary situation, whereas the greater part of the facts that the film evokes, as D. J. Wenden has shown, are purely and simply invented by Eisenstein?” 5 Here, the historian comes close to admitting what elsewhere he found clearly inadmissible. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Potemkin</em> brings together the dramatization of historic events that did not take place (at least in the manner Eisenstein represents them) a carefully constructed mise en scene, a self-conscious aesthetic of composition, and editing—all rudiments of fictional and artistic practice that lead, “paradoxically,” and in the absence of documented facts, to the truthful representation of a historical situation. Moreover, the film was conceived to serve the interest of the new Soviet state—indeed, its propagandistic force was powerfully felt in the West and beyond—and one cannot discount the fact that Eisenstein’s motivation for making the film was in part the desire for “narcissistic prestige.” So many flaws that turn out not to be fatal.</p>
                <p>The paradox is less startling if one examines the elements that seem to justify <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Potemkin</em> as a significant historical film. The first is the seriousness with which Eisenstein undertakes to commemorate a period of revolutionary history for the largely illiterate Russian public, an act of remembrance tied to the survival of the new social order. Eisenstein establishes a meaningful relationship between past and present, one of the primary tasks of the historian. Second, if we look beyond the historian’s concern with the immediate “verifiability” of what the film represents to us, we are struck by the extraordinary structure of representation that Eisenstein invents. He emplots the film’s actions in terms of the social forces that bring them about, and he constructs characters who act in the interest of the antagonistic social classes to which they belong. It is out of this structure of representation that Eisenstein creates his historic model of the revolutionary situation in Russia in 1905. Eisenstein’s film, exceptional in many ways, is not exceptional as an example of films that fulfill the social need to remember.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Defining Collective Memory</strong></p>
                <p>What do we mean when we say that a film, or a history, or a television series has a memorial function? What is meant by “historical memory,” a term that is widely used but little understood? The term seems to derive its meaning from a kind of metaphor in which memory, the individual faculty for reviving images of things past, is extended to an abstract collectivity existing in historical time. Is individual remembrance the foundation of all conceptions of memory? What does it mean to extend the faculty of remembering to a social group? What is the relationship between social memory and the historian’s discourse?</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memory, History, Forgetting</em>, Paul Ricoeur addresses these questions through an examination of the “models” of private and collective memory proposed by the history of philosophy. It is worthwhile summarizing, in admittedly reductive terms, the broad outlines of Ricoeur’s analysis as he charts our way through philosophical concepts. What is particularly interesting for the purposes of this study is the distinctions Ricoeur is able to draw between the private memory represented in the mind of the individual, collective memory that is shared by members of a social group, and historical memory that seems to abandon the phenomenon of presence to the consciousness of mind. Perhaps more important, he considers the possible <em class="notranslate" translate="no">transitions</em> between individual and collective reminiscence and the distant, alienated world of historical representation.</p>
                <p>Private memory is housed in the individual mind and manifests itself for Plato as “the present representation of an absent thing.” The presence of the image in the absence of perception evoked great astonishment in Saint Augustine: how is it that people are not surprised that “when I was speaking of all these things, I was not seeing them with my eyes.”6 Augustine is struck by the “infinite profundity” of human memory, which, although part of the mind, the mind cannot fully understand or control: “Some memories pour out to crowd the mind and, when one is searching and asking for something quite different, leap forward into the center as if saying ‘Surely we are what you want?’ With the hand of my heart I chase them away from the face of my memory until what I want is freed of mist and emerges from its hiding place.”7 Memory refers in fact to two distinct concepts: memory as the (passive) presence of the image to the mind, and memory as the intentional activity of recollection.</p>
                <p>Moreover, for Augustine memory is inseparable from the human experience of time. Past time belongs to the individual consciousness (and not to another’s); it is “my time” that I possess in the continuity of my own existence. Memory as the activity of individual recollection constitutes the past in the present of the mind. It is a reflexive activity. In ordinary language, Ricoeur observes, the reflexive verb of remembering (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">se souvenir</em> in French) suggests that the subject acts on himself as much as on the object of memory: “In remembering (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">se souvenant</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">de quelque chose</em>), one remembers oneself (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">on se souvient de soi</em>).”8 In this conception, then, memory is “radically singular” and exists as the link between the mind and its past. Through remembrance, the individual is able to move back in time to the earliest childhood recollections, which memory evokes and organizes into a linear narrative. In his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Confessions</em>, Augustine offers the metaphor of the “vast palaces of memory,” thus ascribing to internal life a kind of space where memory exercises itself: “Memory’s huge cavern, with its mysterious, secret, and indescribable nooks and crannies, receives all these perceptions, to be recalled when needed and reconsidered.”9</p>
                <p>In the Age of Reason, John Locke also conceived of memory as an activity of consciousness that operates within the individual mind, but he emphasized the role of the memorial function in establishing the identity of the person. Personal identity exists because the human individual, in the process of perceiving, is aware of himself as the entity that perceives. Thinking necessarily involves consciousness, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">self</em>consciousness is the condition of selfhood. The self is always the same, never another, at every moment in the time of his existence. The self possesses continuity in time, and therefore the present person is the same actor who performed actions in the past that persist in memory. The continuity of the life of consciousness maintains itself despite mental distraction, lapses in memory, or any other changes in “substance.” The self, consciousness, and memory are therefore inextricably bound together so that self is the same agent of action who acts now and in the past: “And as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Person;</em> it is the same self now it was then; and ’tis by the same <em class="notranslate" translate="no">self</em> with this present one that now reflects on it, that that Action was done.”10 Locke’s notion of the self and of memory, like Augustine’s, does not allow for any conception of a shared consciousness since consciousness is the very definition of the person. We now need to ask on what basis it is possible to construct a conception of collective memory.</p>
                <p>For Ricoeur, Husserl is a key figure because he “attempts to pass from the solitary <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ego</em> to an other susceptible of becoming in turn a we.”11 Is it possible, asks Ricoeur, that a phenomenology of the intimate consciousness of time can be extended to a phenomenology of collective memory? In the fifth of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cartesian Meditations,</em> Husserl speaks of collective subjects that he calls “intersubjective communities of a higher order” that are constituted on the basis of a process of “<em class="notranslate" translate="no">social</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">communalization.</em>”12 Husserl’s notion of a collective consciousness is startling since his phenomenology of interior consciousness, conceived as pure flow, would seem to set up an insurmountable barrier to any conception of intersubjective memory. Husserl contends, however, that the ego “can be a world-experiencing ego only by being in communion with others like himself: a member of a community of monads, which is given orientedly, starting from himself.”13 Even if the social entity begins in an outward movement of individual consciousness, the plurality of egos “constitutes in itself an Objective world” that “realizes itself” within that world. Intersubjective communities are social entities, and nonetheless they acquire all the “prerogatives of memory”: the community takes possession of memory on the model of individual mine-ness; collective memory exists as a continuity that supposes a plural consciousness; and the community experience of time is structured around the idea of past and future moments. Ricoeur insists that this process of attribution to the collective subject is based in an analogical operation:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>With this hypothesis, which makes intersubjectivity bear all the weight of the constitution of collective entities, it is important, however, not to forget that it is only by analogy, and in relation to individual consciousness and its memory, that collective memory is held to be a collection of traces left by the events that have affected the course of history of the groups concerned, and that it is accorded the power to place on stage these common memories, on the occasion of holidays, rites, and public celebrations.14</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>It is under the sign of the analogical that the collective “we” is authorized to speak about time, memory, and history.</p>
                <p>We turn now from philosophical reflection to the domain of the social sciences, where historians and sociologists have theorized memory as the centripetal force that binds all collective experience. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Collective Memory</em>, Maurice Halbwachs questions the idea that memory has its origin solely in individual consciousness. Individual memory cannot be separated from shared memory; we are, he contends, seldom alone in remembering: “Our confidence in the accuracy of our impression increases, of course, if it can be supported by others’ remembrances. It is as if the very same experience were relived by several persons instead of only one.”15 To remember, Halbwachs argues, we need “an affective community,” a group with which we are closely identified and whose solidarity allows the individual memory to “take possession of itself”; the individual needs to align himself with “the viewpoint of one or several groups and one or several currents of collective thought.”16 The social context throws a bridge across the apparently irreconcilable domains of individual and collective remembrance.</p>
                <p>We could call Halbwachs’s model of memory acquisition <em class="notranslate" translate="no">developmental</em> because it is generated and confirmed in the process of the developing social experience of the child:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>As soon as a child leaves the stage of purely sensory life and becomes interested in the meaning of images and scenes that he perceives, it can be said that he thinks in common with others, that his thought is divided between the flood of wholly personal impressions and the various currents of collective thought.17</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Very early memories do not exist, Halbwachs argues, because the infant is not yet a social being; the process of recollection emerges at the moment when the child begins to take his place within the social “framework of the family.” Moreover, the child learns to situate himself chronologically in the succession of generations. His parents carry with them the vestiges of another period, which give to the child some lived experience of the past: “My parents belonged to this period; they acquired certain habits and characteristics that became part of their personality and made an early impression upon me.”18 The “living bond of generations” extends to the grandparents, with whom the child has close and prolonged contact and who provide the child with “access to an even more distant past.”19 Finally, the bond between generations permits us to conceive a relationship between collective memory, to which we are biographically connected, and the anonymous history that must be learned in the distancing form of written language. The adult the child becomes looks back on his remembered past and learns to integrate it into the framework of contemporary history:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The world of my childhood, as I recover it from memory, fits so naturally into the framework of recent history reconstituted by formal study because it already bears the stamp of that history. What I discover is that by attentive effort I can recover, in my remembrances of my little world, a semblance of the surrounding social milieu.20</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>For Halbwachs, this is the furthest point in time that lived experience is able to reach. Historical distance cuts the bonds of collective memory. History conceives of time as rupture and studies, at a retrospective distance, social groups as they change over time. Memory is living and continuous; history is discontinuous, cut into periods, over and done with.</p>
                <p>In his collection of essays, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">On History</em>, Eric Hobsbawn discusses the reasons why human societies need to remember the past. It is above all, he argues, a question of identity and identification: how does the individual subject establish his place within society? “To be a member of any human community is to situate oneself with regard to one’s (its) past, if only by rejecting it.”21 The individual identifies his place within social groups at all levels of society. In the private sphere of the family, memory relies on memorabilia, personal correspondence, family narratives, and the informal legacy of the oral tradition: “We cannot help situating ourselves in the continuum of our own life, of the family, of the group to which we belong. We cannot help comparing past and present: that is what family photo albums or home movies are there for. We cannot help learning from it, for that is what <em class="notranslate" translate="no">experience</em> means.”22 In his book on the social function of photography, Pierre Bourdieu describes acts of remembrance within families as so many rites that mark the passage of new members into the closed social circle and reaffirm the solidarity of the group: “The images of the past arranged in chronological order, ‘the order of reasons’ of social memory, evoke and transmit the memory of events that are worthy of being preserved because the group sees a unifying factor in the monuments of its past unity or—it comes to the same thing—because it retains from its past the confirmations of its present unity.”23</p>
                <p>In the public sphere, it is the task of memorialists—professional historians among them—to preserve the accumulated experience of the community in order to perpetuate the social group. Andre Leroi- Gourhan calls these acts of remembrance “ethnic” memory because they ensure “the reproduction of behaviors in human societies.”24 Collective remembering is, he argues, the instrument of survival common to all societies, historical or pre-historical: “Beginning with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">homo</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sapiens</em>, the constitution of an apparatus of social memory dominates all the problems of human evolution. … Tradition is biologically as indispensable to the human species as genetic conditioning is to societies of insects.”25 As Hobsbawn observes, memory has functioned as a conservative force; we could say an ahistorical force. The act of remembering links the present moment with the past conceived as an ideal: “For the greater part of history we deal with societies and communities for which the past is essentially the pattern for the present. Ideally each generation copies and reproduces its predecessor so far as is possible, and considers itself as falling short of it, so far as it fails in this endeavor.”26</p>
                <p>The desire of collective memory to preserve the past in the present leads to distortions and “misrepresentations” because memory is steeped in emotion and is often guided by the self-interest of the group. A society’s look back toward the past is infused with nostalgia for the absolute harmony of social relations and the idealized model of social organization and behavior it locates there. The affective and ideological dimensions of social memory are clearly incompatible with the professional historian’s ideal of the objectivity that can come only from the rigorous application of historical critique. However, as tradition, the living perpetuation of the past, has faded with the passage of preindustrial societies—a phenomenon already well advanced at the beginning of the twentieth century—history has stepped into the role of managing public memory. Hobsbawn argues:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Historians are the memory bank of experience. In theory the past—all the past, anything and everything that has happened to date—constitutes history. … And, insofar as they compile and constitute the collective memory of the past, people in contemporary society have to rely on them.27</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In the “historiographical age,” the change in the regime of memory brings with it a radically different character in the public’s experience of the past.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Recovering the Psychological Dimension of History</strong></p>
                <p>In his introductory essay to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Realms of Memory</em>,28 French historian Pierre Nora assesses the relationship between history and memory that obtains in the twentieth century. He begins by observing an irreversible change in the way social groups relate to their past: history, written by professionals, has come to replace traditional memory characteristic of older, particularly agrarian societies. Deprived of the heritage of the past perpetuated as a living part of the present, contemporary societies experience a sense of loss: “What was left of experience, still lived in the warmth of tradition, in the silence of custom, in the repetition of the ancestral, has been swept away by a surge of deeply historical sensibility. Memory is constantly on our lips because it no longer exists.”29</p>
                <p>The social and political events that spell the end of memory can be summed up in terms like globalization, democratization, or the liberation movements that bring old cultures into the era of nationhood and history. Historical perception, reinforced by the power of the media, has triumphed over the process of remembrance that regulated the passage from the past into the future; it substitutes for the depth and intimacy of collective memory the thin skin of the reality it is possible to know through the fragmentary traces it has left. For Nora, history and memory have parted company and are opposed to each other, in absolute terms, in their phenomenological perspective on the past:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Memory, history, far from being synonymous, are thus in many respects opposed. Memory is life, always embodied in living societies and as such in permanent evolution, subject to the dialectic of remembering and forgetting, unconscious of the distortions to which it is subject, vulnerable in various ways to appropriation and manipulation, and capable of lying dormant for long periods only to be suddenly reawakened. History, on the other hand, is the reconstruction, always problematic and incomplete, of what is no longer. Memory is always a phenomenon of the present, a bond tying us to the eternal present; history is a representation of the past. Memory, being a phenomenon of emotion and magic, accommodates only those facts that suit it. It thrives on vague, telescoping reminiscences, on hazy general impression or specific symbolic details. It is vulnerable to transferences, screen memories, censorings, and projections of all kinds. History, being an intellectual, nonreligious activity, calls for analysis and critical discourse. Memory situates remembrance in a sacred context. History ferrets it out; it turns whatever it touches into prose. Memory wells up from groups that it welds together. … By contrast, history belongs to everyone and to no one and therefore has a universal vocation. Memory is rooted in the concrete: in space, gesture, image, and object. History dwells exclusively on temporal continuities, on changes in things and in the relations among things. Memory is an absolute, while history is always relative.30</p>
                    <p>The past is no longer alive in the collective present of the group. Memory belongs thenceforth to the human individual, who is the only entity that remembers, and to the disciplines of psychoanalytic theory and the therapeutic practices of psychology. Once memory has been consigned to archives and historians have imposed the detached gaze that is the ideal of the profession, public experience of the past becomes contemplative rather than direct. However, as Pierre Nora suggests, because our relationship to the historical past has become irreversibly fractured and discontinuous, we engage in a paradoxical search for proximity; we “rediscover” the closeness and intimacy of the past through the burgeoning testimony of its witnesses and the concrete vestiges collected in museums obsessed with preserving artifacts. If history holds us at a distance, the materials of memory put us in touch with the palpable traces of dead reality.</p>
                    <p>Nora describes the effect as “hallucinatory re-creations of the past”31 that are generated out of our desire to possess what has forever flown out of our grasp. “Old” history aimed at the resurrection of the past, as if we could experience, through the historian’s narration, the past “as it really was”; “new” history seeks to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">represent</em> the past through the material existence of artifacts. Such representations, fragmentary but specific, allow us to recover some of the psychological and emotional dimension of historical events embedded within them. It becomes the mission of the historian to trace itineraries through the realia of archives and construct, for the collectivity, the meaningful links between past and present. Thus, in contemporary societies deprived of an immediate relation to their own past, history exercises the memorial function crucial to the survival and maintenance of a social group. Indeed, as Jacques Le Goff reminds us, the loss of collective memory would threaten the social organism with disorder and crisis, just as aphasia and amnesia can endanger the very identity of the individual human subject.32</p>
                    <p>The reorientation of history toward the total life of a people over time and the opening up of new archives of all sorts correspond to a growing public taste for the direct experience of historical traces. In the 1970s, the institutions of memory began to multiply exponentially. This is the period of the emergence of oral histories, the proliferation of museums dedicated to lost traditions, the revival of folklore and festivals, the memoirs that public figures of any consequence felt compelled to write, the vogue of historical programming on television—in short, the emergence of the salvage mentality. The imperative is to save it all, even if one does not know what it is being saved for. Pierre Nora describes the effect produced by this memory mania: “We cannot know in advance what should be remembered, hence we refrain from destroying anything and put everything in archives instead. The realm of the memorable has expanded without reason: we suffer from hypertrophy of memory, which is inextricably intertwined with our sense of memory’s loss and concomitant institutionalization.”33</p>
                    <p>Memory demands representation. This is what Nora calls the “problem of incarnation.” How do the proliferating vestiges of past experience take on meaning within contemporary institutions? They come to reside in specific cultural spaces, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lieux de mémoire</em> (places of memory) of the work’s title. As Nora puts it, memory clings to places just as history clings to events. However, not all accumulations of artifacts constitute such places of memory, which, Nora argues, must correspond to the three aspects of the meaning of the word “place”: the material, the functional, and the symbolic.</p>
                    <p>The place must be material, that is, it must have a concrete existence; however, it is not necessarily topographical and may take different material forms: World War I memorials to the dead that have their place in every French village; a veteran’s organization dedicated to not forgetting past heroism and sacrifice; a historical journal that serves as an inculcation of a vision of the national past. The place must be functional in the sense that the vestiges of the past it collects and displays are part of a social effort to transmit memories, an activation of the past embodied in rites of remembering: public holidays that commemorate the origins of a nation; the folkloric reenactment of traditions and events (e.g., in associations dedicated to the accurate depiction of life in and near the battlefields of the Civil War); Washington’s Vietnam Memorial, Auschwitz, and other places of pilgrimage. In addition, each of these material and functional places must be endowed with a “symbolic aura” that resonates in the public imagination: a site that organizes and condenses the public’s emotional and ideological experience of the past. Finally, Nora argues, a place of memory is constituted through a “will to remember,” the desire to “stop time, to inhibit forgetting, to fix a state of things, to immortalize death, and to materialize the immaterial.”34 Memory in the active sense implies a collective determination to remember. Without this elemental motivation, traces of the past are simply irrelevant to public life and are relegated to the sphere of historical erudition. As far as collective remembrance is concerned, it is “memory that dictates and history that takes dictation.”</p>
                    <p>Places of memory emerge rather spontaneously as their need becomes expressed. The public practice of memory is particularly selfconscious in France, where the will to remember is accompanied by calculated attempts to create an institution of memory. Not long ago, I encountered the following example of a specific place of memory in which film plays a central role. The rite of commemoration took place on October 7, 2000, in the small village of Les Mees in the rural French backcountry of the Alpes de Haute Provence (formerly known as the Basses Alpes). The historical memory evoked was the peasant insurrection that contested the coup d’etat carried out by Louis Napoleon on December 2, 1851, which toppled the Second Republic and created the Second Empire. The insurgents, isolated from the cities with which communication was slow at best, displayed enormous courage in defending the Republic against the usurper, not realizing that the urban masses had accepted the advent of the Empire with general passivity. Launching their resistance from the base of the village commune—the same base of action that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">communards</em> adopted in Paris in 1871—and led by a cadre of artisans organized in secret societies, the insurgents worked militarily and politically toward the goal of assuming power at the level of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">préfecture</em> of the department. They waited in vain for an uprising in Marseille that would amplify a peasant revolt into a powerful regional insurrection. Despite a few glorious victories in the Basses Alpes and in the Var, the rebellion was crushed by the military forces of the Empire, and thousands of the movement’s leaders and peasant troublemakers were sent to the miseries of the French colonial prisons in Algeria.</p>
                    <p>The commemoration of the insurrection was sponsored and organized by the Friends of Les Mees, and the Association 1851–2001, a society composed of descendents of the insurrectionists, historians, schoolteachers, and citizens of republican persuasion in this traditionally “red” area of the French southeast. The events of the day included a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">débat</em>, chaired by the president of the association, with the participation of two professional historians from nearby universities, a history teacher from a local high school, and amateur historians with roots in the communities. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">débat</em> was followed by a ceremony renaming the street that starts from the central fountain of Les Mees, bearing a plaque to the memory of the insurgents, and leads down to the former battlefield where the peasant forces won a brief victory against the armies of Napoleon III. The street now bears the emphatic name of the Rue de la Liberte and des Insurges. The inauguration was presided over by the town’s mayor, a man of clearly republican sympathies, and featured a chorus of young schoolchildren impersonating the spirit of the insurrection. The mayor invited the assembled crowd to participate in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">apéritif</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">repas républicain</em>. The afternoon featured an exhibition of documents—letters, proclamations by revolutionary leaders, public communications from Napoleon III’s counterinsurgent administration—and the projection of the film, a “historical documentary” entitled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">1851: Ils se levèrent pour la République</em> (“They Stood Up for the Republic”). The screening was followed by a public discussion in the presence of the filmmaker, Christian Philibert, and some of his collaborators, the film’s producer, and one of the historians featured in the film.</p>
                    <p>As Nora observes, “memory clings to places.” The choice of the site of this day of remembrance was significant: Les Mees, the place of a victorious battle against the forces of Napoleon III, possesses prominently displayed in its central square, possesses the only public memorial to the insurrection in the department of the Alpes de Haute Provence. The objective of the day’s events was not only to revivify the events of 1851, but also to establish in the village another visible marker of the insurrection to “block the work of forgetting” and “materialize the immaterial.” Moreover, this most recent commemoration was linked to other historical moments when the memory of 1851 emerged from its latency to serve as a major historical reference for the present, notably in the twentieth century in the antifascist movement of 1934 and at the moment of the liberation from Nazi occupation. That there was a strong public “will to remember” was evidenced by the crowds that filled the local movie theater for the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">débat</em> and the film. Discussions were punctuated by emotional statements by participants and the public, particularly those of the descendents of the insurgents who conserve as family treasures the letters from their ancestors writing home from prison in Algeria.</p>
                    <p>The overriding concern expressed by participants and the public was the exclusion of this important piece of republican history from the national curriculum of the public schools, which is centered, they asserted, around the kings and dominant political leaders. Positioned against “official history,” the evocation of the insurrection of 1851 is an example of history from below and involves a pedagogical campaign to restore events to the regional and even national memory. The film is a crucial element in the strategy. Produced independently, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">1851: They</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stood Up for the Republic</em> was scheduled for release on regional television. However, channel FR3 broadcast the film nationally in February 2001. Subsequently, the film was offered to history teachers in regional schools as a supplement to the official curriculum, and a theatrical collective used the film as part of a traveling spectacle to be featured at local fetes in the region.</p>
                    <p>As this example illustrates, film can be a place of memory insofar as it engages the public in a collective recollection that revivifies or creates a meaningful link between a past event and the identity of the social group in the present. Such films often call on the social group to remake its future on the basis of its reawakened knowledge of the past. In the following case studies, I describe two historical documentaries that constitute such places of memory. Ken Burns’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> was broadcast repeatedly on public television and has been preserved on videocassette in nearly every public library in America. Rithy Panh’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine</em> received the International Human Rights Award in 2004 for its interrogation of memory of the Cambodian genocide.</p>
                    <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Losses of Memory—Ken Burns’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the Civil War</em> (1990)</strong></p>
                    <p>Ken Burns’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> sets out to recount the historical events of the Civil War as the founding moment of the American nation-state. Writer Shelby Foote comments in the concluding moments of the series that a significant change in subject-verb agreement denotes this shift from the relatively loose federation of states to the indivisible nation: before the war the United States was a plural noun requiring a plural verb, “the United States are”; after the war, the United States became singular, “the United States is.” The project of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> is to endow this large-scale social entity, whose origins are rife with divisions that will also “long endure,” with something like a collective memory. As the film’s montage will make concrete, the war can be reenacted only as a structure of conflict and pain.</p>
                    <p>In the first episode of the series, Burns raises the problematic of memory in relation to historical events. How is it possible to bridge the distance between the collectivity—the American nation in 1990, embodied in the public television audience to whom the film is addressed—and the historical past, which is cut off from personal experience and perception? Can there be communication between generations at such a historical remove? Ricoeur’s notion of the “triple reign of the predecessors, contemporaries, and successors” in which the dead are constantly replaced by the living, suggests that the succession of generations is both breech and continuity. The successor belongs to the new generation but maintains a biographical link with the predecessor. Moreover, heredity has a social as well as biological character: the fact of reproduction becomes a symbolic value of the highest significance.35Collective memory belongs then to the realm of the symbolic; that is, it is tied to ordinary language and the social fact of the oral transmission of family narratives. Halbwachs sees in the stories told by one generation to the next a “broadening of the temporal horizon,” a partial bridge, an initial link to the anonymous realm of history.</p>
                    <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil</em> War, Burns presents us with filmed footage of such acts of transmission: an ancient veteran of the war recounting his experiences to the young listeners surrounding him, newsreel footage of Civil War veterans of North and South shaking hands across the murderous wall of the battle of Fredericksburg, or the Veteran’s Day parade in which the last human vestiges of the war are displayed in motorcades for public commemoration. But between these archival images that record the last experiential contact with the elders and 1990, the moment of the film’s broadcast, we fall into the anonymity of historical memory, the breach that can be only partially mended through writing. Alienated from our heritage, we can know the past only through mediation: “the distancing in time is thus consecrated by the distancing of writing.”<strong class="notranslate" translate="no">36 </strong>However, as Burns’s film shows, writing history is not reserved exclusively to the domain of verbal narrative but includes the filmmaker’s act of montage, taken in its broadest sense, which constructs a discourse out of visual and verbal material. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em>, like written history, is the product of mediation and speaks with a discursive voice, but the film constantly meditates on this loss, we could even say, rebels against the gap that alienates us from living history.</p>
                    <p>Writing history begins with traces, which are, on the one hand, material vestiges of the past (of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">passage</em> of human actors, to use Ricoeur’s notion), and systems of signs that refer to the past according to their specific modes of signification. The historical events known as the Civil War have left their marks in the visual and verbal documents the film organizes into a discourse. Visual documents include photographic images of events, pictorial renderings of historical scenes, maps, newspaper articles, death notices, and so forth. The verbal documents aurally transmitted include readings from letters, diaries, memoirs, public statements, and proclamations. Such material testimony is not part of a living public memory but lies dormant in archives and libraries and is awakened by the occasional focused exhibition (e.g., the Chicago Historical Society’s exhibit, “A House Divided,” cited in the film’s credits) or commemorative activity (for example, historical reconstructions on the battlefields of the war performed by “reenacters”). Most Americans do not consciously maintain a living link to the past of the Civil War; this collective remembrance, as Nora suggests, must be artificially constructed through places of memory. In producing <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> as such a place of memory, Burns attempts to block the work of forgetting and to memorialize death: to remedy the loss of a whole period of history and to do the quite literal work of remembering the dead, whose lives have been perpetuated through the fractured testimony of archives. What are the strategies of representation the television series uses to construct a collective memory of the war?</p>
                    <p>One might have expected in a film about the Civil War a classical piece of military history, whose perspective is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">from above</em>, and indeed the film intermittently espouses this point of view: the overarching strategies of war (described by the voice-over and symbolically rendered in maps); the major military and political figures whose character and actions determine the unfolding of military events; and the anonymous troops, who can be only represented as masses in action, reduced visually to the abstraction of arrows of movement on the map of a military campaign. However, Burns often prefers to represent the experience of the normally anonymous actors of military history: the officer, the foot soldier, the private citizen who chronicle what they see of the war and their personal reactions to it.</p>
                    <p>In the pretitle sequence that opens episode 4, for example, the film makes its multiple focal points clear. The first shot shows us a detail from a photograph representing a domestic rather than a military scene: a washtub and a pair of hands (accompanied by sounds of rubbing and splashing). The camera then pans up to the face of the soldier at the washboard. The second shot reframes the whole of the original photograph and places the figure of the soldier, previously caught in close-up, as a member of a group engaged in similar activities. The voice-over that accompanies these two shots seeks to “level” the wars’ actors: “In this army, one hole in the seat of the britches indicates a captain, two holes a lieutenant, and the seat of the pants all out indicates the individual is a private” (unattributed statement). Although the members of the group remain anonymous, one at least has been individuated through the use of the panning camera. Such “smallscale” actors constitute what Ann Rigney calls “figures in the crowd,” modest individuals who stand for the group through their status of participatory belonging.37 Some minor actors of history are identified by name and raised to the status of individual historical witnesses.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the characters mandated by history—presidents and generals— are accompanied by a second string of protagonists—officers, foot soldiers, or private citizens. History from above is balanced by history from below. In the opening moments of episode 4, Burns democratizes his dramatis personae by evoking with equal attention the figures of Stonewall Jackson; Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, college professor and officer; Robert E. Lee; Ulysses S. Grant; and Privates Sam Watson and Elisha Hunt Rhodes. Each of the small-scale historical actors, like their big-scale counterparts, is individuated by a photographic portrait in close-up. The intermittent presence of such historically “insignificant” figures across the chain of events that constitute the war places us in the realm of personal experience. Moreover, Burns does not neglect the psychological dimension of major historical actors: Robert E. Lee’s compassion for the Northern troops massacred in the battle of Fredericksburg or General Burnside weeping at his men’s defeat. Thus, the film constructs a counterpoint of public and private voices whose shifting harmonies are intended to evoke the complexity of historical situations. Moreover, the affective dimension of experience expressed through the observations of secondary narrators is redoubled by mise en scene. The voiceless written narratives found in archives are reincarnated by the voices of actors, which give back to the witnesses the partial illusion of their bodily existence.</p>
                    <p>We may ask why it is that this vocal theatricalism seems more acceptable in historical representation than the visual duplication of the historical character through the body of the actor. The answer lies, I think, in the reasoning implicit in the filmmaker’s choices. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">War</em>, like most serious history films, embodies the central dilemma of historical representation in film: on the one hand, there is the desire to “resurrect” the past, to bring it to life, which is a fundamental impulse of the historical filmmaker; on the other hand, there are the limits imposed by historical reference—we can only speak about what it is possible to know about the past. As sensitive spectators of historical films, we continually assess whether a historical film remains within the bounds of justifiable representations.</p>
                    <p>In the interest of accommodating the impulse to reenact, we tolerate infractions against the limits of knowability on the condition of their discretion. The actor’s voice is a discreet reembodiment since the voice of the historical character, unlike his image, has not been documented. The sound of rubbing and splashing water that accompanies the still photograph of the soldier doing his laundry is an “acceptable” real effect because noise, in Western cultures, is not being itself but an attribute of being. Moreover, the sound of water on a washboard or the sound of wind blowing through the steeple at Fredericksburg or in the surrounding forests is part of the universal and unchanging soundscape that can bridge between living presence and the absence of being in the past. The same can be said for the moments in which Burns films natural phenomena in movement in the very locations where historical events took place. In a film that uses essentially static visual representations— photographic or pictorial—the moving image is a startling anomaly. However, because nature is presumably immutable, its representation in moving images constitutes an approximate “sameness” that lends to historical narrative the effect of being in time.</p>
                    <p>At their best, such passages avoid the gratuity of the real effect. For example, Burns evokes the night of horror that follows on the massacre of Union troops at Fredericksburg. A secondary narrator, the eloquent Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, describes night sounds on the battlefield littered with the dead and dying: the “strange ventriloquism” of sounds, “weird, unearthly, terrible to hear and bear,” the cries for help and for death, the “delirious voices, murmuring loved names as if the dearest were bending over them, and, underneath, all the time, the deep base note from closed lips, too hopeless or too heroic to articulate their agony.”</p>
                    <p>Visually, the sequence begins with a close-up of Chamberlain’s photographic portrait: the look that introduces the subjectivity of the witness’s testimony. To the static portrait, the eyes unreadable but suggestive of inner life, the actor’s voice will lend the attribute of real being. The succeeding shots do not depict the human presence that is the center of the narrator’s description; rather, they are filmed nocturnal landscapes, tinted in red and linked by dissolves: the steeple of the Fredericksburg church, light reflecting off ripples in the river, a quarter moon in a dark sky, two shots repeating the visual motif of light on water, and, finally, the moon rising from behind a darkened house and illuminating a scene of trees and cloud-filled sky. The images’ quiet movement is accompanied by the sound of wind, giving the landscapes a full diegetic effect. Here, as very often in the film, the image track and the sound track are set off by a certain disparity: the verbal narration does not find its exact object in the image. Against the last image of the rising moon, the narrator speaks of his state of mind as he lies down among the dead: “At last wearied and depressed, I moved two dead men a little and lay down between them, making a pillow of the breast of a third.” The effect is one of poetic irony: the quietude of the living landscapes belies Chamberlain’s agonizing account of death and dying. At the same time, the landscape’s emptiness resonates as a metaphor for loss.</p>
                    <p>The photographic images, which make up the great majority of the image track of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em>, are historical traces—a million photographs were taken on the battlefields of the war. Like all historical traces, the photograph combines presence and absence: the presence of the rich signifier of being, the absence of the subjects which have fallen away into the past. This presence/absence can be expressed, following Roland Barthes, as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">having-been-there</em> of the image. Thus, the photograph, despite its material existence, is arrested movement; it does not evolve in time. It is the most poignant expression of loss: the phenomenological richness of the image serves to intensify the sense of absence. Indeed, loss is one of the fundamental themes of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">War</em>. In episode 9, the narrator describes how the photographic plates, which produced the images so sought after during the war, were sold after the war as glass for greenhouses, where the sun gradually burnt away the last traces of the events the plates had documented.</p>
                    <p>Is it possible, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> asks, to recapture some aspect of being? The desire to reanimate is palpable in many of the techniques of representation that Burns uses in his film. The sound track, for example, often juxtaposes the animation of the noise track against the arrested life of the photographic image. The photograph preexists, but the sound track belongs to the film’s moment of enunciation. The fabricated noise of battle—drum rolls, rifle and cannon fire, soldiers’ screams, the whinnying of horses—evolves through time, the very condition of its representation.</p>
                    <p>The film’s use of the zooming and panning camera is a second technique of animation. Its purpose is to give the already-framed photographic or pictorial image, normally read as whole and as a trajectory across the work imposed by its composition, some qualities of being. Panning can reinstall a sense of discovery—the suspense that gradual revelation creates—and the enigma the moving camera promises to resolve. For example, the film very often presents the human figure through an upward pan from the feet (the point of minimum individuation) across the body (the more expressive elements of posture and hands), to the face as the ultimate locus of identification. The photograph is thus experienced through time, despite its static character. Lateral panning performs a similar function, particularly in the panoramic scenes of battles. The zoom-in on photographs with great depth of field reveals the detail that was lost in the expanse of the broader view. In a less dynamic fashion, reframing the same photograph at various distances allows for a similar exploration of the image according to the technique of analytic editing so crucial to filmic representation: isolating and relating details or contextualizing partial views in a broader shot.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that such techniques of presence run the risk of transgressing the boundaries of historical narrative, and that is why I have emphasized the discretion with which Burns uses them. Not all historical documentaries avoid the sins of revivification. The History Channel, for example, endlessly recycles films in which historical documents are mixed with open appeals to the spectator’s imaginary. Static documents such as photographs and drawings give way to romanticized tableaus, filmed historical scenes with their human actors, whose identifying features must, paradoxically, be hidden from the viewer. The bad faith of these representations is signaled by cliched techniques of effacement: the historic actors are seen at a great distance, from behind as they retreat from us or from below where they exhibit only legs and costume, or they are suffused into unrecognizability by lenses or gauze.</p>
                    <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> is, by contrast, serious history, and its deepest moments are a meditation on memory and loss. Moreover, the admixture of materials is rich and varied. The voice-over narration assumes several positions. It is the knowing voice of history whose retrospective viewpoint embraces the distant horizon of events: “But the biggest tests were coming that summer where the Mississippi took a sharp turn at Vicksburg and at a sleepy corner of Pennsylvania.” It interprets the character of the events’ major actors: “Bold action did not come naturally to Ambrose Burnside, though he had come to Fredericksburg determined to display the fighting spirit his predecessor, George McClellan, had so conspicuously lacked.” It marshals the support of participants and witnesses through citation: “Some wondered why the Confederates didn’t make it harder for them to cross [the Rappahannock at Vicksburg]. ‘They want to get us in,’ one private said. ‘Getting out won’t be so smart and easy.’” It reinvests the photographic image with the historic meaning it has lost. While a long shot, empty of human presence, shows us a country lane bordered by a stone wall, the voice-over endows it with the specificity of the historical event: “Four lines of riflemen waited behind a stone wall that ran along the base of the hill. General and officers assured James Longstreet, ‘A chicken couldn’t live in that field when we open upon it.’”</p>
                    <p>As I have observed, the voice of history often yields to the plurality of secondary narrators, who, through the actors’ voices, appear to speak in their own names. The narrative function is intermittently held by individual historians, who recount events or reflect on their meaning, either directly in addressing the camera/interviewer or commenting from offscreen the succession of visual documents. The talented raconteur, Shelby Foote, allows us to savor the Confederate soldiers’ legendary “rebel” yell or the display of northern lights that occurred after the battle of Fredericksburg: “But the whole heavens were lit up with streamers of fire and whatever the northern lights are. And the Confederates took it that God Almighty Himself was celebrating a Confederate victory.” The colloquial and poetic quality of Foote’s language, his southern accent, and the intimate quality of the close-up evoke something of the intimacy of oral history. The film’s score, based in period folk music, also plays on familiarity and works to humanize the transpersonal events of the war. We have already seen Burns’s telling use of photographs and drawings, the way diegetic sound quickens the image, and his meditative use of beautiful filmed landscapes.</p>
                    <p>Collective memory can never be reduced to an objective causal sequence of dated events. If collective memory is to be held in the consciousness of a social group, it must be endowed with qualities that replicate to some degree the intimate relationship that personal memory establishes between reminiscences and the mind that holds them. As <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> reminds us, collective memory is alwaysalready a social phenomenon because it is generated out of the social practice of narrative. If history is a large-scale narrative that stands above, and aloof from, the small-scale forces that play themselves out in historical events, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em> attempts to reinvest abstract history with the innumerable minor narratives generated from the experience of human groups and individuals. The voices of the witnesses we hear in Burns’s film call for the spectator’s identification: we listen to their accounts of events as if we had become parties to the intimacy of a dialogic exchange. The voices imbue their photographic likenesses with the subjectivity of being. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Civil War</em>, collective memory is a construct, a discursive strategy that attempts to reconnect us with the living reality of the past. The strength of the film resides in the fact that, all the while seeking the illusion of real being, it acknowledges the impossibility of resurrection and confronts us with inescapable loss.</p>
                    <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Compelling Memory in Rithy Panh’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21—the Khmer Rouge Killing Machine</em> (2003)</strong></p>
                    <p>Rithy Panh’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> is a film of rare urgency: it reopens the wound of the Cambodian genocide, even today largely unacknowledged by the perpetrators of the genocidal acts and repressed in the deepest layers of consciousness of their victims. Few works in the history of cinema embody such a moral imperative to speak about historical events. Between 1975 and 1979, the Pol Pot regime, in the name of creating a classless society, pursued unconscionable policies of deportation and forced labor that led to the death of many hundreds of thousands of people from starvation and exhaustion. Moreover, it prosecuted a paranoid program of annihilation directed against the perceived enemies of Angkar, the revolutionary party of Democratic Kampuchea: the victims included the educated classes—teachers, students, professionals, intellectuals—anyone suspected of ties with the overthrown government of Prince Sihanouk or foreign agencies, or simple people who breached rules or were suspected of harboring antiparty ideas. In a period of four years, nearly two million people perished at the hands of the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                    <p>Rithy Panh is haunted by his personal memories of genocide. He was eleven years old when his family was deported from Phnom Penh to the countryside, victims of the plan to empty the city of its two-and-a-half million inhabitants in a matter of days. In the horrifying conditions imposed by the Khmer Rouge program of reeducation, he witnessed his parents and sisters dying of hunger and exhaustion. At the fall of the Pol Pot regime in 1979, he was granted refugee status in France, where he hoped to “erase everything and begin again at zero.”38However, Panh would not be able to suppress the psychic aftermath of the experience of genocide. In Paris, he decided to study film and enrolled in the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques (Idhec). His emigration had made possible his choice to become a professional filmmaker, but his motivation ran deeper. “Irradiated” by the horror of his experiences, Panh waited for the maturity he needed to reflect meaningfully on a past that haunted his existence. He was determined to speak about the unspeakable human experience of genocide and use the filmmaking process as an instrument of persuasion and pragmatic action:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Without genocide, without wars, I would probably not have become a filmmaker. But life after genocide is a terrifying void. It is impossible to live in forgetfulness. You risk losing your soul. Day after day, I felt myself sucked into the void. As if keeping silent was capitulation, death. Contrary to what I at first thought, to relive is also to take back your memory and your ability to speak.39</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In 1996, while he was making a film called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bophana, a Cambodian</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tragedy</em>, based on the case of a woman who was tortured and executed for sending love letters to her husband, Panh staged the extraordinary encounter between survivor and artist Vann Nath, who painted from memory scenes of abuse and victimization, and the guards responsible for holding, torturing, and executing prisoners in the death camp named S21. In an ironic twist of history, Nath, who survived S21 because the Khmer Rouge designated him as the prison’s official painter, turned his art against those he was formerly forced to serve. It was this experience of delayed confrontation that led Panh to conceive the project that would become <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine</em>. Panh writes that Vann Nath, whom he had first met at the Paris Peace Accords in 1991, would “become the central character of my work on memory during the succeeding ten years.”</p>
                    <p>The film takes place at Tuol Sleng, a former high school in Phnom Penh that the Khmer Rouge transformed into S21 (S for security, 2 for second bureau, 1 for brother number 1, Pol Pot). For Panh, S21 is the central character of the film, a place “haunted and as if impregnated with the drama that unfolded there.”40Seventeen thousand people, rounded up on the least suspicion of resistance to party policy, were brought here, kept in barbaric conditions, tortured, and made to confess to absurd acts of treason. Once their treachery was documented (the Khmer Rouge kept meticulous records, both written and photographic), they were summarily executed. Of the 17,000 victims, seven survived. At the time of shooting <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em>, there remained only three.</p>
                    <p>How, Rithy Panh asks himself, does one approach the reality of lived experience when memory is “in shambles”? It was not enough for the Khmer Rouge to obliterate all the institutions of Cambodian society— they closed schools, factories, and hospitals; shut down the banking system; attacked the family; and outlawed religion. They also moved to eradicate what Leroi-Gourhan terms <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ethnic memory</em>: the collective recollection of traditions that ensures the survival of a society.41 To brainwash an entire people and instill in them the ideology of the Angkar, the Khmer Rouge needed to disrupt traditions, wipe out altogether the memory of shared experience, and impose a new collective life modeled on party dicta. This was the purpose of the massive displacement of populations, the infliction of forced labor, and the suppression of all modes of communication not controlled by the party.</p>
                    <p>In prisons like S21, the attack against memory was also an attack against individual consciousness. Brutal means of extortion were devised to coerce victims into “reconstructing” their lives in the form of “biographies,” preferably written in their own hand. These tissues of lies were intended to extirpate personal memory and wipe out the victims’ sense of themselves as human beings. Under such traumatic treatment, dehumanized individuals are no longer able to perform the essential operation of memory: to reconstitute the past of their experience in the present of the mind. Self-consciousness and memory are no longer inextricably bound. Thus, it becomes impossible for victims, who never act but are acted upon, to conceive of the continuity of the self (Locke’s personhood) because they are no longer able to establish the link between the present, where action is impossible, and their actions in the past, now obliterated from memory. The victims of torture are deprived of subjectivity: unable to remember, they cannot remember themselves.</p>
                    <p>The heart of Panh’s project is not therefore the reconstruction of the past in historical terms, if we mean by that objective analyses of the Cambodian genocide. Rather, he wants to deal with collective “amnesia,” the “retrospective bewilderment of a people” still traumatized by genocidal events never acknowledged by the Khmer Rouge leaders, some of whom continue to hold positions of power. The victims of genocide still live with terror; and terror, the filmmaker reminds us, acts “like an anesthesia, blocking memory, favoring forgetfulness and denial.” To bring repressed memories to mind, the survivors of S21 must resist their defensive instincts and subject themselves to the pain of traumatic recollection. On the side of the torturers—those among them who are driven to acknowledge their participation in the Khmer Rouge killing machine—memory is blocked by guilty defense against the reality of their acts. They are caught between the necessity to speak and the unspeakable.</p>
                    <p>Panh, as the film’s guiding consciousness, is not an objective observer; he is himself a victim of genocide and therefore a subject in search of his position within the genocidal narrative. He has come to his task after a period of “maturation” of twenty years. He has brought together and trained his Cambodian production crew, who were not chosen because of their technical expertise, but because they shared the common experience of genocide. The film’s crew is characterized by their participatory belonging to an affective community in the name of which they act as instruments of memory. “I needed a team,” Panh explains, “who spoke the same language, who had lived through the same history. It is a force, this cohesive team, who never hesitated even at the most delicate even dangerous moments.”42 Panh chooses Vann Nath as the film’s central protagonist because Nath has already taken up the position of the heroic subject who refuses to forget and pits himself against the recalcitrant opponents of memory.</p>
                    <p>Panh’s method aims at unleashing memory in the most immediate sense. He is not interested in the documentary method that illustrates the past through the montage of documents organized and directed by the voice-over commentary. Such films, he believes, manufacture events, furnishing answers determined in advance. Panh prefers to remain in the interrogative mode; his documentary method consists in listening. Moreover, he remains resolutely in the present: he sets himself the task of staging the return of memories of genocide by stimulating and provoking its living witnesses. He does not intervene directly in the film, in the manner of a Claude Lanzmann or Marcel Ophuls, but one detects at every moment the signs of his rigorous mise en scene: “I deliberately chose to stage this situation, by imposing on myself a moral rigor that requires I keep the necessary distance from the witnesses and that I not let them deviate from the goal we had set.”43 Panh’s approach is confrontational: he brings his witnesses back to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em>, the now empty spaces that were once the scenes of their crimes or suffering; he blocks them into uncomfortable positions and pressures them with his interrogating camera; he compels them to confront the traces of their past experience. He stages the return of the repressed: the revivification of stifled memory in the minds of the individual torturer or victim. The result is what Panh calls a “look from the inside of our collective memory.”</p>
                    <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em>’s staging is profoundly psychological and involves the most painful of realizations. Pahn focuses on individuals: two remaining survivors of S21 on the one hand and, on the other, a small number of guards, interrogators, the prison “doctor,” the keeper of the records, a driver of the trucks of death, with particular emphasis on Him Houy, the “chefadjoint du Santebal.”“I wanted to be able to put a name to a face,” Panh tells us, “I didn’t want anonymous victims or torturers with masked faces.”44 Indeed, our introduction to the traumatized world of contemporary Cambodia occurs in the rice paddies and the house where Houy lives with his parents and his wife and two children. In a moment of terrible irony, Houy the mass murderer takes his newly bathed baby on his lap. How is it possible to admit that such a gesture of tenderness comes so easily to a man guilty of monstrous acts? In the warm penumbra of the house, he complains of his symptoms (headaches, lack of appetite) and denies his responsibility (“The evil is the leaders who gave the orders”), while his parents suggest how he can assuage the bad karma of so many deaths (“Tell the truth, then have a ceremony”).</p>
                    <p>The scene that follows serves as a rejoinder to Houy’s denial, part of the patterns of confrontation that structure the film. It begins with a close-up of Nath’s hand and brush applying color to a painting in progress as he begins to tell the story of his arrest and his arrival, along with thirty others, at S21. The words he speaks are also denoted in the painting: the blindfolded and shackled prisoners are being dragged along by a rope around their necks. The victims massed in the dark foreground are indistinguishable from each other, except for the figure Nath individualizes by applying touches of light blue; the background is dominated by an ominously lit building. The scene of Nath painting is shot in a single take. The camera pans repeatedly between the painter’s hand and brush, the palette, the painting, the painter’s face, sometimes tracking forward on the painting to isolate elements of Nath’s account (the shackled feet) or panning up to the prison’s lighted windows as Nath describes his sensations as he is being pulled up the stairs of the cell block.</p>
                    <p>Memory demands representation. What could be more evocative of the process of the representation of memory in both verbal and visual forms? Nath’s verbal narration of events implicates the presence of the camera and the filmmaker (instruments of communication) and the audience for whom he is bearing witness. The camera’s movements create the links between Nath’s face (the locus of memory), the instruments of visualization (the hand, the brush, the palette), and the painting through which memories are rendered. As if guided by the voice, the camera emphasizes the relationship between the verbal and the visual, complementary vehicles of memory.</p>
                    <p>If <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> begins with the individual consciousness, its goal is to represent collective subjects. Nath describes and paints a scene of shared experience: the common plight of thirty prisoners. It is through remembrance that Nath the individual takes his place within a social group; in this case, it is the relationship he establishes between himself, the solitary survivor, and the collective mass of the dead on whose behalf he feels called on to bear witness. To recall Ricoeur’s principle of fidelity that animates historical representations, Nath quite literally documents the horrors of S21 to exonerate his debt toward the dead. Out of the void of S21, he recreates Halbwach’s affective community— the group with which he is closely identified and that allows his individual memory to “take possession of itself.” Ethnic memory, to recall Leroi-Gourhan’s notion, has been nearly silenced, and the danger is, Panh suggests, that Cambodian society may not survive the fracture of genocide.</p>
                    <p>As we soon learn, Nath’s paintings are not only intended as part of the recovery of social memory, they are also the locus of confrontation between the society of victims and the Khmer Rouge functionaries of terror. The film’s ninth sequence, to take an example, begins with a long shot: Nath stands in the background next to a painting; five former guards on his right look on, as if they were pupils taking a lesson. The painting represents a cell: inmates, seen from above, are arranged symmetrically on the floor, feet to feet, head to head, in four rows of ten, their bodies and faces cast in the same mold of suffering. A final row, asymmetrical to the others, occupies the far background. Beyond the rows of palettes stands a guard with a whip. Nath, in close-up, looks offscreen at his interlocutors while he begins not only to describe the conditions of incarceration (“Death came every day.”“So we slept with corpses.”) but also to individuate the apparently identical figures by pointing at them (“I was here.”“This one was hanging between life and death.”).</p>
                    <p>In the confrontations Panh stages between victims and torturers, the scale of the shots is important. The close-up emphasizes the subjective, calling on the spectator to identify with the thoughts or emotions of the former victim or, in the close-ups on the persecutors, to sense their psychological response to evidence of their guilt or the truthfulness of their confessions. In the close-up in the sequence cited above, our proximity to Nath as he confronts the guards intensifies our identification with him as the victim become interrogator. The medium shot, on the other hand, produces, Panh tells us, the appropriate distance between the spectator and the witness to allow for critical judgment. In response to the close-up on Nath, Panh gives us a reverse angle of two guards in medium shot, expressing their adversarial position as they listen to the painter’s admonition: “How could you get used to such acts, seeing such suffering.” The blocking of the shot has the two men, Prak Khan and Him Houy, staggered in depth, an artificial disposition of men in awkward poses, suggesting they have been called on the carpet. The scale of the shot allows us to read the guards’ stiff body language, their defensiveness, and the desperation of their denial.</p>
                    <p>One guard justifies his acts as the result of indoctrination by the party: “We were the party’s right hand. … We couldn’t hesitate in the face of the enemy.” At the word <em class="notranslate" translate="no">enemy</em>, we cut back to a close-up of the painting, the camera refuting the epithet of “enemy” by reference to the pathetic victims. The camera then pans up to a close shot of Nath, who asks, “What about the children? They were against whom?” In response, we are given a closer medium shot of the two guards. Houy, who is placed further in depth, replies: “When the Party makes an arrest, it arrests an enemy of the people,” and the enemy’s family is guilty by association. The sequence ends in a close-up of Nath, who listens to the guards reiterate Angkar doctrine (“The Party, S21, never made arrests by mistake.”) as we read the pain and anger in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>It was this resistance on the part of the perpetrators that Pahn hoped to break down through techniques of mise en scene. How could the guards be persuaded to bear witness to actions that were unspeakable? What mechanism might trigger remembrance in those who were desperately defended against it? Panh noticed that a younger guard, who had been abducted as a child and brought to S21, where he was indoctrinated and recruited by the Khmer Rouge, could evoke his role only by shouting slogans: “His words, delivered in a hard, hammered tone, were accompanied and completed by gestures, as if another mechanism of memory had been set in motion: the automatism of gesture, the routine of crime.”45</p>
                    <p>This insight led Panh to the technique of reenactment: he would place the guards in the cellblock in S21 where they had worked and would ask them to reenact their daily activities. The space of the scene is no longer that of Nath’s paintings; the palettes and the suffering bodies are gone. The guards perform their rounds and inspect rooms that are nothing more than vast, empty spaces. Deprived of a set and props, they must describe in words and mimic in gesture their patterns of behavior. Thus, the guards become both the narrators of their actions—a position that assumes a certain distance from what is being narrated—and the actors who place themselves in the roles of their former selves. The film contains several scenes staged in this manner, the most explosive of which feature the guard recruited as a child. As he mimics a search of a cell with another guard, his voice fills with anger at the prisoners’ misbehavior: “‘Get up! On your feet! Hands up!’ I start my search. I look, I feel.” And then: “‘You! Taking your shirt off? Without the guard’s permission? To hang yourself by your shirt? Give me that!’ I grab it and take it away.”</p>
                    <p>Rithy Panh’s methodical assault on the repression of memory aims at recovering not only truth but also the psychological and emotional dimension of past experience. As Pierre Nora suggests, such closeness to the past can be rediscovered only through the testimony of witnesses and the concrete vestiges of the past collected in museums and archives. S21 the museum of the Cambodian genocide and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> the film possess all the characteristics Nora ascribes to places of memory. S21 is a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">material</em> place. Panh’s cinematography reveals it as a series of vast, empty rooms, haunted by memories. Moreover, his assertive mise en scene transforms the museum into a place where participants bear witness to genocide and bring alive the traces left behind in the written and photographic archives the Khmer Rouge fanatically accumulated. The museum and the film are both <em class="notranslate" translate="no">functional</em> places committed to lifting the “taboo of silence” and transmitting to the public meaningful traces of the Cambodian genocide. Panh hopes his film will become a pedagogical tool and fill out the few pages consecrated to the subject in Cambodian school textbooks. S21 has a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">symbolic</em> aura; it resonates in the public imagination and organizes and condenses the public’s experience of the past. Finally, it embodies <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a will to remember</em>: S21, the museum and the film, operate to “stop time, to inhibit forgetting, to fix a state of things, to immortalize death, and to materialize the immaterial.”46</p>
                    <p>However, it is one thing for the young Cambodian public—to whom Panh particularly addresses his film—to discover the vestiges of their national past in S21 the museum. It is quite another to confront the actors of the Cambodian genocide with the painful traces of their own existence. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> the film, the archives, far from objective traces of events, are powerful catalysts of memory. They stir the ashes of experiences that are not entirely extinguished for either victims or perpetrators. We first meet Chum Mey, the prisoner who survived because he could repair the Khmer Rouge’s busy typewriters, as he approaches the building in S21 where he was imprisoned. The encounter is traumatic, and he weeps as he says to Nath, who tries to comfort him, “My wife, my children. … I lost everything. Nath, help me.” In the next sequence, Nath reads to Mey from the record of his confession and shows him the list of the names of people he denounced under torture. Mey responds, “They beat me so badly, Nath, I couldn’t take it.”</p>
                    <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> focuses particularly on the process of confrontation involving the prison personnel and the archival evidence of their acts. In sequence 12, for example, a guard seated at a desk at some distance from the camera reads the Khmer Rouge manual entitled “Method for Writing a Document,” that is, techniques ranging from political pressure to torture used to extract confessions. As the reader’s voice describes the “interrogation procedures,” four guards move from the far background toward the camera and put in place a torture chair. In sequence 13, the reading of the text continues over the reenactment in which two guards enter a cell and mimic taking a prisoner away, blindfolded and handcuffed, to be interrogated. Sequence 14 returns us to a close-up of the document being read and the guard’s finger following the text. Torture, we learn, is divided into three levels: “mild, hot, and rabid.” A document shows us the record of the rabid group’s activity and at the bottom the name of the reader, Prak Khan. The camera pans over the photos of victims lying in disorder across the desk. Then Prak Khan points out the members of the rabid group in a photograph. The camera returns to panning across the victims’ photos as we hear the first words of a confession Khan has prepared: “I was arrogant and had power over the enemy. I never thought of his life. I saw him as an animal.” The camera returns to a shot of the reader, Khan, in close-up, as he says, “My heart never checked my brain.”</p>
                    <p>Other moments involve the perpetrators in more spontaneous confrontations. In sequence 39, for example, three former guards in a vacant room unroll a huge photographic print. One of them recognizes the subject—“It’s Choeung Ek base where we killed the prisoners”— and points out the landmarks: the hut where the prisoners waited execution, the already-dug pit where the executed would be buried. Houy recalls the stench that rose up from the cracked earth. Sequence 41 places the executioners in the real site of the photograph. It is night, and a few lights illuminate Houy and a second guard, near a pit filled with water. To the incongruous sound of croaking frogs, they recount in grisly detail the procedures of execution and their own indifference to death and suffering.</p>
                    <p>The absurd documents intended to demonstrate the guilt of the victims of S21 “today turn against their authors, proving in the eyes of history the implacable logic of genocidal crime.” If one examines the archives with the eye of the archaeologist, Panh asserts, one can also detect the traces of human resistance: “You discover at the turn of a phrase, behind a look, the will to resist in someone who is going to be tortured and executed in the coming days or weeks.”47 If Panh has constructed his film around the acts of remembrance of individual victims and perpetrators, his intention is to reclaim from anonymity and meaninglessness the thousands who died at S21. How is it possible to negotiate between the psychological experience of victims and perpetrators and at the same time construct a history of the Cambodian genocide? Panh’s response is that historical meaning must come “through the prism of individual histories placed end-to-end.”</p>
                    <p>Near the end of the film, the camera shows us a wall of photographs of victims, part of the museum’s exhibition: the Khmer Rouge’s photographic documentation of prisoners was as complete as the records of their confessions. The camera tracks right and reveals in depth other panels of photographs displayed on other walls—still only a sampling of the collectivity of victims. The camera continues to pan across hundreds of photographs and stops in front of the images of three young women. In the center is the face of the young woman we have seen repeatedly on the desk where the victims’ confessions were recorded. We know her name, Nay Nan, and that she worked in a hospital. We have listened to Prak Khan’s confession (taken in close-up by the interrogating camera) in which he describes how he abused and beat her, how he prodded her into collaborating in the fabrication of fictitious acts of sabotage—defecating in the operating room in order to discredit a model hospital—and how he coaxed her into choosing between the CIA, the KGB, or the Vietnamese as the foreign agency she worked for. She is the “face in the crowd,” the human individual whose identity radiates across the apparent anonymity of the victims’ photographs and brings us to the realization of the enormity of their suffering.</p>
                    <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> demonstrates one of Pierre Nora’s most insightful formulations: “Memory is rooted in the concrete: in space, gesture, image, and object.” Without the disturbing reality of S21, whose vast, dusty spaces haunt memory; without the gestures through which the guards reconnect with their past actions; without the images—painterly and photographic— that draw out the witnesses and make them speak about their past; without the objects abandoned in S21, like the button Nath discovers amid the rubble of a vacant room at the end of the film, the Cambodian genocide cannot be remembered. However, there is nothing magical or nostalgic about the memories that emerge. They are not given to the “hazy impressions” and “symbolic details” that Nora attributes to memory; they are brutally real. History and memory, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> seems to suggest, are not necessarily in opposition. In this film, memory is not “a vague telescoping of reminiscences,” and it does not “accommodate only facts that suit it.” Rithy Panh, through his implacable methods of mise en scene, makes himself into the cruel instrument of history who ferrets out the truth of memory. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">S21</em> disavows the notion that history “belongs to everyone and to no one.”</p>
