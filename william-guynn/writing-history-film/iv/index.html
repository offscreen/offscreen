                <p>This chapter addresses a central problematic of historical representation in the cinema: is it possible to construct a properly historical character in film?</p>
                <p>The term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">character</em> seems hardly appropriate since it is defined in many dictionaries as “ one of the imaginary persons who figure in a work of fiction.” The term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">historical actor</em> presents a similar problem since the actor plays a role, and the theatrical notion is not applicable to history except, one assumes, as metaphor: the role played by Napoleon in “ exporting” the French Revolution. In defense of the epistemological break between history and fiction, historians have resisted conceiving of history as narrative because they associate narrative with the creation of imaginary worlds. They are not given therefore to examining the nature of those narrative agents that act upon and are acted upon in the course of historical events. It is no wonder, then, that historians confronted with representations of historical figures in film are highly skeptical. They consider cinema as a spectacle irremediably tied to the imaginary, particularly because of the feature that characterizes all visual representation of historical action: doubling. There is the doubling of mise en scene, in which a set in a theater or a location in a film, so clearly part of the here-and-now of the act of representation, are intended to stand in for the real place in the past. Similarly, there is the doubling of the actor and his role: the actor belongs to the moment of performance, the role to the person or social entity that acted in the historical past.</p>
                <p>The doubling implicit in mise en scene and the actor’ s performance correspond to the two moments in time that referential narratives necessarily embody: the moment of enunciation from which the historian/ narrator speaks and the historical moment to which his discourse refers. But, historians would argue, fiction, particularly dramatic or filmic fiction, is characterized by excess. There is first the excessive presence of its mechanisms of representation: film needs to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">show</em> us characters, settings, and actions in their phenomenal reality, a duplicated reality mediated by filmic processes. By contrast, history <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tells</em> us about the past; it retreats into the discretion and distance of written discourse, where narration becomes the act of aligning verbal facts on a chain of cause and effect so that the already constituted characters and events would seem to speak for themselves. The historian does not <em class="notranslate" translate="no">represent</em> the past— representation is too close to resurrection — he <em class="notranslate" translate="no">refers</em> to it. Moreover, under the ethical constraints of a referential discourse, he removes all the supports that sustain the notion of character in fiction: he rejects the representation of historical scenes in descriptive detail and the use of dialogue <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in extenso</em> ; embracing truth rather than verisimilitude, he resists the anachronistic urge to psychologize the historical character using what Kate Hamburger calls“ verbs of internal action ” ; and he refuses to reduce the collective forces of history to a configuration of protagonists and antagonists acting out their roles according to the conventional codes of narrative.</p>
                <p>One cannot, of course, argue with the ethical constraints that govern historical discourse or defend the historical spectacle film and its fictionalized characters, which clearly belong to the realm of the imaginary. If film is capable of constructing historical characters, then it also must eschew the techniques of the imaginary and operate under the constraints that govern what can be said about the past. However, I argue in the following that history— written or filmed— <em class="notranslate" translate="no">is</em> narrative; therefore, there is a fundamental kinship between factual and fictional storytelling. As Jean-Marie Schaeffer compellingly argues (see Chapter Two), narrative is always a mimetic activity: novels, histories, plays, and films all imitate events, and events are all representations of the actions of the actors, whether historical or not. So, we are faced with a dilemma: is it possible to acknowledge on the one hand the kinship between history and fiction as narrative and on the other hand preserve the specific identity of the historical actor?</p>
                <p>I propose to approach the problem from the perspectives of two disciplines: narrative theory and philosophy of history. Narratology reflects on the general question of the nature and function of the character in narratives, whether written, theatrical, or filmic. I emphasize the work of Philippe Hamon in“ Pour un statut semiologique du personnage ” ( “ For a Semiological Status of the Character ” ) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Personnel</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">du roman: Le système des personnages dans les</em> Rougon-Macquart <em class="notranslate" translate="no">d’Emile Zola (The Personnel of the Novel: The System of Characters in</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Emile Zola’s</em> Rougon-Macquart) <em class="notranslate" translate="no">,</em> which offers a semiological model of the character, supported by the work of structural linguists and narratologists. Philosophy of history, on the other hand, establishes a special notion of the character, the subject/object of historical actions, which is consistent with the scale of historic discourse and in large measure serves to define the nature of historical representation. The work of Maurice Mandelbaum in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Anatomy of Historical Knowledge</em> and the meditation Paul Ricoeur offers in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Time and Narrative</em> on Mandelbaum’ s notions are rich in ideas relevant to our discussion. By calling on these two domains of theory, I look first for a broader notion of character that includes the agents of history and second for the criteria according to which historiography specifies the nature of the historic character.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Narratological Approaches to Character</strong></p>
                <p>In his introduction to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le personnel du roman</em> , Philippe Hamon describes the concept of the character as a“ complex field of study ” with three major aspects. There is first the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">figurative</em> , which presents the character as modeled on experience and therefore contributes a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">reality effect</em> to the narrative. The work of figuration endows the narrative actor with the apparently arbitrary features of existence: descriptive details of behavior that have no function other than to connote the real. The use of details by nineteenth-century historians, for example, provides the reader with images of individual personalities that go well beyond the functional demands of narrative: Louis Blanc represents Robespierre as the revolutionary who takes his solitary walks“ accompanied by his faithful dog and, occasionally, stops to listen to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">petits</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">savoyards</em> … as they sing their songs from the mountains. ” 1 Indeed, what historian does not relish the documented detail, the sign of real existence, even as he describes the“ anonymous” actors who perform the fundamental actions of history.</p>
                <p>Second, the character is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">anthropomorphization</em> of the narrative, which attributes to the narrative agent certain capacities of the person. In his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dictionary of Narratology</em> , Gerald Prince defines the character in precisely the same anthropomorphic terms:“ An EXISTENT endowed with anthropomorphic traits and engaged in anthropomorphic actions; an ACTOR with anthropomorphic traits.” 2 The character is, then, the entity capable of taking the position of the subject or object of an action. As I discuss, the historical character may be a human being, but may also be an abstraction or a force of nature.</p>
                <p>Finally, the character is a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">crossroads of projection</em> , where the desires of the author, the reader, and the critic or scholar meet and are satisfied or not.3 As many philosophers of history acknowledge, desire, at least part of which is unconscious, is at the root of scientific curiosity and the commitment the historian makes to specific events and actors. Therefore the historian has the moral duty to talk about what he is searching for. As Henri-Irenee Marrou puts it, he must“ describe his internal itinerary, for all historical research, if it is truly fecund, implies progress in the soul of its author.” 4 The reader, scientific or not, also searches for satisfactions that cannot entirely be defined as intellectual. The reader of history, who seeks historical comprehension of events, all the same chooses histories of a particular kind and finds pleasure in the exploits of the protagonists, even though historic actors are often collectivities or even“ impersonal” forces of nature.</p>
                <p>Why, then, in the contemporary era, have we held to the model of the character as the psychological individual, a kind of quasi person? Hamon describes the dominant trend, beginning in the seventeenth century, that subjects the character, explicitly or implicitly, to a psychological analysis that “ systematically conflates <em class="notranslate" translate="no">person</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">personnage</em> , <em class="notranslate" translate="no">experience</em> (the real) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">experimentation</em> (the textual).” 5 Hamon identifies the sources for what he calls this“ overvaluation” of the individual subject: the rise of the individual in the modern period as “ the juridical and philosophical essence,” as “ universal value,” in contrast to the exemplary quality of characters in medieval literature; the increasing valorization of the novel and its aesthetics of representation since the seventeenth century; and the“ influence of theories of history that continue to privilege the perspective of the human individual as the center of creation, ” that is, the conception of political history of personalities, dominant well into the twentieth century.</p>
                <p>This “ personalist” conception of character is supported by the attitudes adopted by readers, authors, and critics. The reader, through the process of identification reinforced by the solitary nature of reading, takes pleasure in the projective impression that characters really “ come alive.” The author, for his part, indulges in a fantasy about his characters ’ autonomous“ lives” : how many novelists in interviews have spoken about how their characters“ take off on their own, ” as if liberated from the constraints of the writing process? In much critical discourse, the “ living” quality of characters becomes the hallmark of good literature and overshadows consideration of the rhetoric or stylistics of the textual construction of characters.</p>
                <p>From a semiological perspective, Hamon observes, the character cannot be a corporal entity because there is no way to localize“ him. ” The character is “ everywhere and nowhere” in the text: he is glimpsed in the textual web of dialogues in which he speaks or which speak about him, in the descriptive and narrative passages, in the themes that emerge from the telling and the reading. Like other products of narration, the character is a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semantic effect</em> of the accumulating text: “ Manifest in the form of a discontinuous group of traits, the character is a diffuse unit of meaning, progressively <em class="notranslate" translate="no">constructed</em> by the narrative. … A character is then the base [ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">support</em> ] on which rest the semantic constants [ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">préservations</em> ] and transformations of narrative;‘ he ’ is composed of the sum of the information provided about what he <em class="notranslate" translate="no">is</em> and what he <em class="notranslate" translate="no">does</em> . ” 6</p>
                <p>A semiological analysis of the notion of character argues, then, that the character is a unit of signification and not a human individual. However, the twentieth century is still under the sway of the psychological conception of the character as pseudo person and the pronouncements of Henry James and others, who see in the internal states and movements of individualized characters the wellspring of all action and meaning. Semiologists struggle, Hamon argues, to disengage literary criticism from the “ psychoanalytic” perspective that tends to confuse the experience of the real individual and the construction of the textual unit that acts in the manner of a subject. In discussions of the psychological sort, still quite common in courses on literature or cinema, the critical act consists in“ discovering” the key to the behavior of characters. As Hamon puts it,“ We plunge into full judicial arguments, exactly as if we were speaking of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">living</em> beings whose incoherent behavior must be justified.” 7</p>
                <p>Major theoreticians of narrative agree with Hamon that characters in narratives are <em class="notranslate" translate="no">constructed</em> entities. For Claude Levi-Strauss, “ the character can be compared to a word encountered in a document that cannot be found in the dictionary, or to a proper name, that is, a term stripped of its context, ” 8 which only the unfolding of the narrative can provide. For Tzvetan Todorov,“ the‘ semantic label ’ of the character is not a stable ‘ given’ that exists a priori and that the reader only needs to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">recognize</em> , but a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">construction</em> that takes place during the time of a reading. ” 9 In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Structural Semantics</em> A. J. Greimas takes a further step in disassociating the entities acting in narrative from the notion of the personalized character.10 <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Actants</em> are defined not by“ who they are” but as narrative functions, a limited number of positions adopted by various actors in relation to the narrative’ s trajectory. The character may have one or more functions, and a function may be assumed by more than one actor according to Greimas’ s classification: the subject (the protagonist, the searcher) and the object (what the subject looks for); the sender (the motivator of the search) and the receiver (of the searched-for object); the helper (who/which favors the subject’ s action) and the opponent (who/which opposes the subject’ s action). Moreover, actantial functions may be fulfilled by nonhuman entities (the grail as the object of the quest or the contrary winds that impede the ship’ s progress as opponent) or ideas (the religious concepts that propel the subject-crusaders on their mission). This kind of functional analysis of character is just as pertinent to history as it is to fiction. Indeed, as I attempt to show in the case studies to follow, Greimas’ s functions have parallels with the categories historians employ in asking questions about historical events. What entities constitute the historical protagonists? What is the object of the action? What forces propel the protagonists into action? For whom or what are the actions undertaken? What elements favor or thwart the subject’ s goals?</p>
                <p>Semiology, then, proposes a broader notion of the character that is not limited to mimicking the psychological individual, the privileged character in novelistic fiction, but allows us to consider fictional and historical characters as performing similar functions in narrative texts. Indeed, semiologists would argue that the analyst is unable to differentiate, in functional terms, between historical figures, individual, collective, or inanimate, as they appear in historical fiction and as they appear in legitimate historical narratives. It is much easier to distinguish between the “ real” and the“ fictional ” characters of the same name on the basis of the work of construction that each entails.</p>
                <p>Hamon proposes a category of actors he calls <em class="notranslate" translate="no">referential characters</em> . These are not only historical characters, but also mythological and allegorical ones, which bring with them into the world of the fiction a set of actions, behaviors, and especially images that are part of the shared cultural baggage of the reading public. They appear, Roland Barthes observes, as “ citations,” ready-made figures lifted from the commonplaces of the cultural codes, to which the author refers without making any effort to “ to construct— or reconstruct— the culture they give voice to. ” 11 Unlike other narrative actors, these referential characters do not “ come alive.” They make relatively short appearances in fictional texts — Napoleon in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">War and Peace</em> or Abraham Lincoln in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Birth of</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a Nation</em> — where they signify for the reader/spectator a place, a time, a situation, their meaning and destinies fixed in advance. Fictional protagonists, on the other hand, are semantic“ blanks,” unknown characters with proper names that are gradually characterized as the narrative develops. I would add a second type of ostensibly historical characters: the protagonist who adopts the name, the position, and some of the acts of the historical person— but is taken over by the fictional imagination. Thus, the historical figure is“ filled out” with anecdotal details of behavior and signs of inner subjectivity that belong to the unknowable of the historical past. The cinematic costume drama, the Hollywood biopic, and other subgenres of the history film provide countless examples of such pseudohistorical characters.</p>
                <p>We can make some initial assertions about narrative actors in history by comparing them to the types of characters that appear in fiction. In contrast to the referential character, the character in historical narrative is not a citation, an unexamined figure lifted from the already known of a culture; he, she, or it is an entity reconstructed by the labor of the historian. He is not a semantic“ blank,” even if the historian proposes to study a figure neglected by previous histories, since the historian ’ s work is based on what it is possible to know about the real past of the protagonist of an action. The historical character exists, more or less latently, more or less formed, before the historian begins to research or write about his existence. In contrast to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fabulations</em> of the costume drama, the historical character is constrained by the traces of his existence and all the other histories of which he has been the subject. However, he retains something of the fictional protagonist because the historical character is not prewritten: the historian assigns the historical actor to his proper place in the chain of events, charting his role in the teleology he is reconstructing.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Historiographical Approaches to Character</strong></p>
                <p>We pass now to the camp of the historians to consider how they describe the nature of the character in history. As Antoine Prost observes, historians are largely in agreement about the nature of the objects of their study; he demonstrates this by citing statements by many major figures of modern history. Fustel de Coulanges asserts that history is“ the study of human societies. ” Charles Seignobos echoes him:“ History, in the modern sense, is reduced to the study of men living in society.” Lucien Febvre separates history from metaphysics: history is not interested in the human as universal essence,“ some notion of man as abstract, eternal, at bottom immovable, perpetually identical to himself,” but in a concrete notion of organized human activity,“ men always captured in the framework of societies of which they are members.” Marc Bloch emphasizes that the historical subject is always the group, not the individual: “ Rather than the singular, favorable to abstraction, the plural, which is the grammatical mode of relativity, is suited to a science of the diverse. ” 12 The historical character is normally, then, a collectivity, a social group of varying proportions: the Nation, the International Community, the Arab World are large-scale historical characters; a political faction, a trade union, or a militia are smaller-scale historical characters. As for the individual human subject, he may be considered as a historical character under specific conditions:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>In order for an individual man to interest history, he must be, as we say, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">representative</em> , that is representative of many others, or else he must have had a verifiable influence over the life and destiny of others, or finally that he brings out, by his very singularity, the norms and habits of a group in a given time.13</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The historical individual embodies, in the manner of the synecdoche, the traits of his class, acts“ alone” on the stage of history in relation to collective actors, or serves as a foil whose difference paradoxically signals the general social patterns from which he deviates.</p>
                <p>The subjects of all historical narrative are human beings, organized in groups and living in society. The field of historical characters can only rarely be reduced to an individual or a number of identifiable individuals. Historical narrative is, then, more abstract than psychological fiction in that historical characters do not conform to the fictional model of a configuration of individual protagonists. The historical actor is a collective figure involved in collective actions. On the other hand, the historical character is not abstract in the philosophical sense of the universally human, always and everywhere the same. As Paul Veyne would say, history is a sublunary form, attached to concrete time and space.</p>
                <p>As the privileged subject of social discourses, the collective actor can act, desire, or feel like the individual actor. In the following passage, Prost brings out the anthropomorphic qualities history attributes to abstract entities:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Society</em> , <em class="notranslate" translate="no">France</em> , the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie</em> , the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">working class</em> , <em class="notranslate" translate="no">intellectuals</em> , <em class="notranslate" translate="no">public opinion</em> , the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">country</em> , the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">people</em> : so many concepts that have as their characteristic feature the fact that they subsume a group of concrete individuals and appear in the historian’ s discourses as plural singulars, collective actors. They are used as the subject of verbs of action or volition, even sometimes under the reflexive form: the bourgeoisie <em class="notranslate" translate="no">wants</em> , <em class="notranslate" translate="no">thinks that</em> , <em class="notranslate" translate="no">feels</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">itself secure</em> or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">menaced</em> , etc., the working class is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dissatisfied</em> , it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">revolts</em> . Public opinion is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">anxious</em> , <em class="notranslate" translate="no">divided</em> , it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">reacts</em> , unless it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">resigns itself</em> .14</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>But is it proper to assign to the collective actors of history the qualities that seem to belong to characters in novels? Historians and sociologists have long resisted this transference and have denounced as“ naive realism ” the act of giving to social groups the attributes belonging to the novel ’ s human“ individuals.” But faced with the common phrases that Prost offers as examples in the passage just cited, we have to yield to the fact: historians cannot help but use the language of individual intentions and psychology in representing the actions, feelings, desires, and even emotional states of historical actors. What does the use of such a vocabulary mean? If fictive and historic actors are defined by the same process of attribution, then can we conclude there is a direct relationship linking them together?</p>
                <p>It is Paul Ricoeur who has reflected in the deepest and most subtle ways on this question. At the beginning of the first volume of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Time and</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Narrative</em> , Ricoeur observes that there is a deep split between narrative discourse in historiography and narrative in fiction, and an essential part of this split hinges on the differentiation between actors in history and actors in fiction. At the end of this same volume, Ricoeur retraces “ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">an indirect filiation</em> linking historiography to narrative intelligence ” that does not deny in any way the“ epistemological <em class="notranslate" translate="no">break</em> between the historiographical entities and narrative characters.” The break resides in the distance separating the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">anonymous</em> historical entities who act “ in the background of individual actions” and individual narrative agents.15</p>
                <p>To respect the epistemological break, Ricoeur proposes a notion of the historical actor that maintains with the fictional actor an indirect link of kinship. He calls the societal agents of history <em class="notranslate" translate="no">entities of participatory</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">belonging</em> . This formulation rests on the definition of society that Maurice Mandelbaum gives in his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Anatomy of Historical</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Knowledge</em> : “ A <em class="notranslate" translate="no">society</em> , I shall hold, consists of individuals living in an organized community that controls a particular territory; the organization of such a community is provided by institutions that serve to define the status occupied by different individuals and ascribe to them the roles they are expected to play in perpetuating the continuing existence of the community.” 16 Ricoeur underscores the importance of the three aspects of the definition: the community’ s link to a territory; the institutional regulation of the social identity of the individual; and the community ’ s continuity of existence.</p>
                <p>Mandelbaum permits us therefore to envisage a single society as a quasi person located in a specific space, made up of organized groups of individuals, and acting within a duration that articulates past, present, and future. The historical character resembles, then, other narrative agents. Like the individual human agent, the historical character is capable of having desires and intentions, behaves as the subject or object of verbs of action, and accumulates attributes, as novelistic agents accumulate “ character traits.” Moreover, he operates within a narrative world that has spatial coherence and temporal continuity. In his definition of society, Mandelbaum insists on the collective nature of social entities while at the same time making what Ricoeur terms <em class="notranslate" translate="no">oblique reference</em> to the individuals who make them up. Society, since it is made up of individuals, acts like a great collective individual. The relationship between the individuals and the society is based in the notion of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">participatory belonging</em> , and the individual actors participate in collective action through their attribution as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">members of</em> . To quote Ricoeur ’ s summation:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>It is because each society is made up of individuals that it behaves like one great individual on the stage of history and that historians can attribute to these singular entities the initiative for certain courses of action and the historical responsibility — in Aron ’ s sense— for certain results, even when these were not intentionally aimed at. But it is because the technique of narrative has taught us to dissociate characters from individuals that historical discourse can perform this transfer on the syntactical level.17</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Techniques of Representing Historical Actors</strong></p>
                <p>I would like to return to a work of theory on historical representation that proceeds inductively from the study of specific historical texts. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Rhetoric of Historical Representation</em> , Ann Rigney approaches the problem of the construction of historical actors through an analysis of three histories of the French Revolution written in the nineteenth century: Alphonse de Lamartine ’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Histoire des Girondins</em> , Jules Michelet ’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Histoire de la Révolution française</em> , and Louis Blanc’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Histoire</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">de la Révolution française</em> . Her work, informed by contemporary narratology, analyzes historical writing in terms of the pragmatics of textual construction. Rigney underscores the problems the historian/ narrator faces in conceptualizing and developing a discourse on the French Revolution. What is called the revolution is in fact a vast“ eventworthy ” field (Veyne) that can be traversed in many ways, according to the perspective the historian adopts. The revolution is made up of events in which a multitude of characters, individual and collective, participate. For the most part, the actors of the revolution do not occupy the scene of history in continuity; subjects or objects of action, they appear and disappear at the dictate of the broad concerns of the macronarrative. Thus, the historian, unlike the novelist, cannot organize his narrative around a stable configuration of characters“ whose recurrence across the narrative syntagma provides ground against which the continuities and transformations in the represented world can be measured, and whose hopes and fears provide the basis upon which any such changes can be evaluated.” 18 Rather, it is the historian ’ s task to identify and configure a shifting field of actors that embodies the collective development of the revolution and shows the way to its ultimate effect. As Rigney demonstrates, the choice to include or exclude particular figures determines how the“ collective historical subject ” is identified at each moment of the drama.</p>
                <p>What is at issue in the macronarratives of the revolution is the development of a grand social entity — the Nation or France, for example — “ the subject of‘ History’”— which is by definition impersonal or, rather, “ transpersonal.” Its evolution is manifested in the actions and interactions between individuals, institutions, and groups at each moment of narrative development. Groups may be“ ad hoc formations, ” or they may have the more stable existence of an institutionalized entity, even if the name of the group does not always refer to the“ same” stable membership. The name attached to the individual or group has the advantage of reference for the reader: a name is a shorthand identification of an actor that enables the reader to“ follow his progress throughout the narrative. ” To a certain extent, the characters of the revolution are prefigured; that is, they exist as already identified individuals or groups who play a well-known role— Robespierre and the Garde Nationale, for example— and they bring with them meanings, a semantic dimension, that preexists in the received culture of the public of readers. However, even the individual actors whose presence is obligatory in any account of the revolution are open to refiguration: the historian may modify or radically transform the received meaning of characters; he may assign them a particular place on the chain of causality or may determine the role they play (subject or victim, hero or antagonist) and their ideological character (reactionary, progressive, for example). The individual historical character may have a biographical dimension, and to the extent that his actions, words, and behavior have been documented, he can be the object of psychological analysis. How many historians have reflected on the“ personality” of a Danton or a Robespierre?</p>
                <p>However, historical characters often are not distinguished by a proper name because they are anonymous or because their“ personalization” is not relevant to the narrative of events. Rigney emphasizes the conventional character of the language that refers to social entities. The group, composed of a number of unidentified individuals, presents itself as a figure named in the singular, le Peuple, for example, as the entity appears in Blanc or Michelet. When the nineteenthcentury historian chose to present a character that was unknown to his reading public, he had several means of identifying him: through his actions and conduct or by his belonging to a class or category of actors — sex, profession, nationality, and so on. The historical actor is presumed to share the attributes and the symbolic or moral values by which his group is defined. As Rigney tells us, nineteenth-century historians linked moral values and physical appearance. Thus, with Lamartine only the royal family retains the moral and aesthetic qualities of humanness, evoked in lengthy descriptive passages. All the others are part of the madness of the crowd, grotesque in appearance and bereft of human motives. To the extent that the historian foregrounds a character as member of the group, he embodies in this individual the aspirations of the collectivity. The focalization on individual but previously unknown characters that Rigney calls“ figures in the crowd ” serves to define the group. The narrator attributes to this lone face only those traits relevant to the description of the historic situation and to the role his group will play in events, that is, the signs he manifests as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">member of</em> his class.</p>
                <p>In general, historical characters are defined in relation to the other actors involved in the same narrated event, and the play on resemblances and differences between characters is one of the foundations of narrative, whether fictional or historical. The historical character is also related by his diachronic links with actors who have already acted or will act in the future. As we have seen, the historian’ s retrospective understanding of events allows him at any given moment of his narration to position the historical character not only in relation to his past but also in relation to events that have not yet taken place.</p>
                <p>These general considerations on the nature of the character in historical discourse are predicated on written texts, and it is certainly true that the cinematic means of expression impose specific conditions on the identification and elaboration of characters (see Chapter Two). However, nothing prevents us from applying to filmic representation the definition of the historical character, as developed in this chapter, and the textual problems of representation that Rigney analyzes in terms of written narrative.</p>
                <p>Leger Grindon has argued (following Georg Lukacs’ s analysis of the historical novel) that the dramatic structure of the historical film attempts to blend the personal and the collective. The collective is the properly historical aspect of representation, with its emphasis on the group profile, common action, and public ritual. The individual, revealed in intimate scenes, is the locus of the identification through which the public experiences the psychosocial motivations that drive the individual protagonist toward historical action.19 As we saw, skeptical historians deride this admixture of the personal and the“ historical” as a mayonnaise that does not take and consider the extrapersonal elements of collective action or spectacle as nothing more than the historical alibi for what is at the heart of the film: the psychological or epic drama of imaginary protagonists. However, I argue in the following analyses that historical films indeed privilege the extrapersonal in one of two ways. Either the film works to include the individual within the social by describing the distinct personality as an aspect of the group profile and incorporating the intimate scene as part of a collective action, as if the personal and the extrapersonal were simply different scales of representation chosen at particular moments, or the film uses a rhetorical strategy in which the individual embodies a whole social position, the intimate scene condenses the collective situation, and, in the manner of the synecdoche, individual actions stand for collective destiny. The two films that are the objects of the following case studies, Jean Renoir ’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> and Mikhail Kalatozov ’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> , construct the protagonists and antagonists of the most convulsive of historical events: revolution.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: A History to Save the Republic—Jean Renoir’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Mars eill ais e</em> (1938)</strong></p>
                <p>The narrative goal of nineteenth-century republican histories of the French Revolution, Ann Rigney suggests, was the construction of a grand subject of history, one that would embody the aspirations of the new era. A very similar intention would seem to motivate Jean Renoir ’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> , a film that looks back nostalgically — but also with a certain desperation — to the founding moment of contemporary France and the metanarrative that recounts how that transpersonal, transcollective character of the Nation emerged from the ashes of the old regime. How does the historical representation of the Nation that Renoir constructs in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> in 1938 fit into the tradition of republican history for which it seems a latter-day reflection?</p>
                <p>Antoine Prost observes that“ history is a social practice before being a scientific one. ” 20 Historians address their public— the society, or segments of society, in whose interest they pursue their research and for whom history takes on meaning. Ultimately, history is not erudition for its own sake but a discourse that functions to connect the members of a society to their historical past. In the wake of the turbulent events of nineteenth-century France, the Third Republic (1870– 1940) understood that it was in the national interest to establish universal education for all social classes and to make the study of history— republican history — an essential part of the curriculum. In the period between 1880 and 1882, left-leaning majorities in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate laid the foundations for the modern French system of instruction by making education secular, free, and obligatory. The close relationship between a political vision of the French nation and the teaching of history emerged as a strategy for mediating social divisions, especially through the fusional figure of the Nation.</p>
                <p>Thus, through a process of exclusion/inclusion, French historians retrospectively realigned the significant events of the French nation. The republican view imposed order and meaning on the complex and sometimes inchoate developments of French history and rendered a valuable service to the state. The anachronistic survival of this socalled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">école méthodique</em> in a scholarly context that called for objectivity in the historical sciences was largely due to the useful social function it performed in educating young French students for civic life.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>While doing this [elucidating the historical causes of contemporary situations], [historians] explain to the French their divisions, give them meaning, which allows the French to accept them and to live them in the political and civilized mode rather than in the violent mode of civil war. History’ s mediation has permitted, by means of a reflexive detour, to assimilate, to integrate the revolutionary event and to rearrange the national past in relation to it. French society gives itself representations of itself through history, it understands itself, thinks itself through history. In this sense, it is profoundly true that history is the foundation of the national identity.21</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Because of the social power of republican history, a truly analytic, critical history made a tardy entrance into the historical institutions in France. Indeed, Pierre Nora dates the final demise of this last predominant form of history/memory with the collapse of the Third Republic, that is, in the cataclysmic events that ended in an occupied France in World War II. Until then, it sustained a tradition of memory based in the notion of the Nation:“ Throughout this period, history, memory, and the nation enjoyed an unusually intimate communion, a symbiotic complementarity at every level— scientific and pedagogical, theoretical and practical. ” 22 In the course of the 1930s, Nora argues, a movement of desanctification emerged among historians that put into question the couple Nation-State and substituted for it the couple Society- State. While the concept of the Nation embodied ultimately the reconciliation of differences in the interest of national solidarity, the concept of Society acknowledged social conflicts and contradictions that might be irreconcilable and threaten the notion of an overriding unity. Thus, the new historian, in his theoretical and pedagogical roles, rejected the function of the standard-bearer of a tradition, the messenger who transmits values. He was no longer“ part priest, part soldier, ” as Nora puts it, but a critical instrument that“ sows doubt; it runs the blade of a knife between the heartwood of memory and the bark of history. ” 23</p>
                <p>Doubt was, however, politically dangerous in the France of 1938. The notion of the Nation, so recently desanctified by professional historians, needed to be resanctified and revitalized as the ideological center of history under the Third Republic. The choice to situate the origins of the modern French world in the events that follow on 1789 is significant. The grand historical narrative of late nineteenthand early twentieth-century France is republican in character, and the curriculum in history begins with the assumption that contemporary France is heir to the tradition of the revolution, and that its identity is grounded in the affirmation of this historical continuity. Skirting the embarrassing problem of the Terror, the Third Republic erects a bridge across the Empire, the Restoration, and the Second Empire to reestablish its historic roots in the ideals of the French constitution.</p>
                <p>Historian Guy Bourde observes that the educational policy of the Third Republic — formed by highly placed members of the state administration and forces within the university— developed according to specific goals: “ to educate the new generation in the love of the Republic in order to consolidate the social base of the regime; to subdue clerical obscurantism by removing from the Catholic Church control over the human mind; to prepare for revenge against the hereditary enemy, the German Reich. ” 24 This militant program, at odds with the reevaluation of historiography that was taking place within the university, found its pedagogical expression in the textbooks in history, geography, and civics historians wrote for children. Bourde notes that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Petit Lavisse</em> , the famous and consecrated <em class="notranslate" translate="no">manuel d’histoire</em> targeted at children from seven to twelve years old, was already in its seventy-fifth edition in 1895.25 With a young readership in mind, E. Lavisse’ s language was simple and lacking in nuance and the political points openly promulgated. For the last edition in 1912, E. Lavisse, doubtless with an eye on the historical crisis then developing between France and Germany, made the political goals of his textbook explicit:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>If the schoolchild does not take away with him the living memory of our national glories, if he does not know that his ancestors fought on a thousand battlefields for noble causes; if he has not learned what it cost in blood and effort to unify our fatherland and to disentangle, from the chaos of our obsolete institutions, the laws which have made us free; if he does not become a citizen infused with his duties and a soldier who loves his rifle, the schoolteacher has wasted his time.26</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>It is ironic to think of Renoir associating himself with this kind of rhetoric. Antipathetic to received ideas, Renoir had always been the filmmaker of the social differences and class antagonisms that splinter the French body politic into incompatible divisions. In this regard, his social vision is much more in tune with the emergence in the 1930s of a new history that saw France as a divided society, not a cohesive nation. Moreover, Renoir the realist was not given to conventional representations or the ideological abstraction of allegorical figures. Yet in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marseillaise</em> Renoir reshapes the old figure of the Nation, which, despite its maintenance at the symbolic center of the national curriculum, was becoming increasingly dated; the pedagogical history fostered by the Third Republic, with its tendentiousness and militancy, was out of synch with scientific developments in twentieth-century historiography.</p>
                <p>It is not difficult to understand, however, in the chaotic world of France in 1938 the social forces that motivated Renoir. It was the role of historical memory, invoked by the Popular Front, to revivify the founding moment of the revolution and its defense against foreign attack and offer it as the model of national unity to be followed in a period of crisis. In his provocative reading of the film, Leger Grindon argues in part that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> operates as a sort of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">film à clef</em> , in which certain characters or events are covert references to contemporary figures of Popular Front politics or to polemics within the left. Thus, the vacillating Louis XVI stands for the weak socialist Leon Blum, or a scene set at Valenciennes “ alludes to the division in the Popular Front over the Spanish Civil War. ” 27 Indeed, according to Grindon, Renoir ’ s film can be read as a history of the Popular Front:“ Viewed in this context, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> expresses the euphoria of the campaign, the tensions within the coalition, and the disillusionment with leadership <em class="notranslate" translate="no">.</em> ” 28</p>
                <p>It strikes me as more likely, however, that Renoir, in the realization of the film, sought to take his distance from the internecine politics of the Popular Front. Paradoxically, Grindon makes this point as well, citing Renoir: “ It would be impossible for us to make a film on the present political situation; this would risk provoking polemics and being disagreeable to a public which goes to the cinema simply for distraction. ” 29 Indeed, the film seems to avoid specific historical parallels in favor of a grand vision of the revolutionary tradition of the alliance of classes — the Nation of republican history— that is intended to bolster the general social program of the Popular Front.</p>
                <p>As Renoir ’ s remark indicates, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> was intended for the broad French public in whom the film aimed to revive the ethos of nationalism. It is precisely his project to evoke a political kinship between two historical situations, even though the militant initiatives of the revolutionary forces in the period of 1789 to 1792 hardly resemble the demoralized inertia of French society and the faltering, factional left of 1938. The Nation is a kind of“ mystical union,” here portrayed as the abiding historical force that will come to succor the internally and externally besieged France on the brink of war. In response to internal crises and the threat of the German war machine, Renoir’ s film reworks an ideology that is not based in class conflict but in national harmony and unification against France’ s traditional enemy. The kind of crossnational sympathy expressed in the French and German aristocratic or working-class characters in Renoir’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Grande Illusion</em> , produced only a year before, is unthinkable in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> , in which such bonds take the form of treacherous cross-national allegiances between French royalists and their German counterparts against the emerging French nation.</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> , Renoir’ s strategy for representing historical characters binds together two apparently disparate representational tendencies: to construct the character as a figure of participatory belonging, an abstraction of the attributes of his class, and to anchor the character in the concreteness of the individual (most notably in the photographable body) and the specific details of mise en scene. As I attempt to show, the tension between the abstract and the concrete underpins the major aspects of the film ’ s approach to its material: the narrative roles the film assigns to its characters; the description of the social groupings as members of (or outlanders to) the Nation; the representation of difference and the effacing of difference among the members of the Nation; and the filmic strategies that modulate and combine the abstract and the real.</p>
                <p>The Nation is an abstract large-scale entity that seems to bear few of the anthropomorphic traits that distinguish the character in narratives. It is very far from any “ personalist” conception of the actor. It is not modeled on direct experience; it produces no <em class="notranslate" translate="no">real effect</em> because it lacks material existence. In semiological terms, the Nation does not belong to the realm of denotation because no body or group of bodies can directly represent it; indeed, it is characterized by its physical absence. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> , it belongs to the intangible realm of the symbolic: it cannot be represented, it can only be <em class="notranslate" translate="no">signified</em> . More like a projection than a normal character, the Nation is quite literally“ everywhere and nowhere ” in the text: it never speaks, it is spoken about; it does not act in its own name but operates at a remove through the intermediary of more concrete characters. Its existence is signaled nonetheless by a name. The“ Nation” is frequently on the lips of the films ’ protagonists, and its identity is progressively constructed as the film unfolds. It is a semantic effect, the ultimate signified of the positive human actions the film represents.</p>
                <p>Indeed, one can see the film as the narrativization of the virtues of the Nation. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> is therefore less an action plot than a work of figuration in which, by example or counter example, every actor and every action serves to fill the abstract Nation with meaning. The Nation is patriotically French (the artisan, clerk, priest), not allied with foreign powers (as are the royals, particularly Marie Antoinette); it is impassioned and vital like the orators at a political meeting in Marseille, not nostalgic and moribund like the aristocrats in exile at Coblentz; it is popular and democratic (the citizen, the foot soldier), not elitist and hierarchical (civil authorities, generals, and the cavalry).</p>
                <p>The process of figuration in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> is very close to the trope of synecdoche: the concrete actors and actions stand as partial (and incommensurate) embodiments of the abstract concept of the Nation. It is therefore not surprising that Renoir’ s film does not correspond to the narrative model in film. In classical cinema, attention is focalized on a few individualized protagonists who are the privileged instruments of the action (and of meaning), and the action itself is organized into a tight chain of cause and effect, forming the dynamically structured plot. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> proposes, by contrast, a multiplicity of characters, who are conceived less as individual protagonists than as members of their class and whose acts are therefore not personal feats but the exemplification of collective action. Moreover, the film is episodic in structure: we move from place to place, from one event to another, not because one action is the immediate cause of the next but because Renoir wants to illustrate the general spheres of revolutionary and counterrevolutionary action.</p>
                <p>Given these deviations from classical structure, how can we describe the film ’ s characters and their positions within the narrative? I would argue that the actantial model, briefly described in the section on narratological approaches, offers an effective instrument not only for the analysis of characters in films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> but also in historical narratives in general. A. J. Greimas makes a productive distinction between <em class="notranslate" translate="no">actant</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">actor</em> thus providing a more flexible conception of narrative agencies, one more appropriate to historical discourse. The actant is a basic role in a narrative that can be carried by multiple actors; actors are characters who are so many concrete embodiments of the actant in the narrative. The actant is therefore more general and more abstract than the individualized actor and corresponds more adequately to the conception of the collective entity that often acts in historical narratives. It is not tied to the notion of the character as a pseudoperson or to the stable configuration of protagonists and antagonists, which assumes that narrative is the product of interpersonal conflicts. The actantial model is therefore able to comprehend the shifting field of actors who appear and disappear at the dictate of historical narration and account for a large-scale actant like the Nation. Such changes in the dramatis personae do not disrupt narrative continuity because historical action is not necessarily tied to the continuous acts of specific actors.</p>
                <p>An actantial analysis of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> makes Renoir’ s project quite clear. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">subject</em> can be identified as the Marseillais, the revolutionary army that ventures north in the defense of the revolution, but also le Peuple, the French body politic exclusive of its political masters (the royals, the aristocrats, civil authorities, generals, etc.). That is, the subject is all those actors who act in the interest of the Nation. The defense of the revolution is then the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">object</em> the subject seeks. However, there is a second object of the quest, a necessary corollary of the first, the formation of the Nation, an ideological construct that the actors illustrate through their commitment to action. National fusion also emerges through a process of identification in which the different social actors, suppressing all social division, merge their interests with those of the Nation. One becomes part of the Nation through a process of initiation, best exemplified by the character Bomier, who at first rejects as pompous and foreign, then gradually masters the revolutionary hymn, “ La Marseillaise.” To learn“ La Marseillaise ” is to adhere to the Nation. During the march toward Paris, an unidentified soldier speaks with a second soldier, perhaps a courier, about to depart, charging him with two commissions: giving twenty francs to his nephew and teaching him “ La Marseillaise.” The Nation-seekers ’ actions all target a single object <em class="notranslate" translate="no">,</em> the fusion — represented in the film as the literal coming together in revolutionary Paris — of the patriotic social classes from all regions of France. At the end of the film, the Nation, invested with the actions of its adherents, becomes the collective entity that Renoir proposes as the subject that will defend France against foreign attacks (in the wake of 1789 or in response to the German threat in 1938).</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sender</em> , who transmits values to the subject and motivates him in his quest, is embodied in several characters: progressive priest le Pere Paget, who calls on the young to join the revolution; the patriot Moissant, who urges the citizens of Marseille to take the city’ s four forts; Louise Vauclair, Parisian fishmonger, who insists the Marseillais volunteers go to Paris to take care of the traitors— the king, the queen, the members of the National Assembly who fear le Peuple de Paris <em class="notranslate" translate="no">—</em> before attacking the Austrian army; and the shadow puppet performance in Paris, which represents the King and the Nation separated by the abyss of the Brunswick Manifesto, issued by the German army invading to safeguard the monarchy.</p>
                <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">opponents</em> of the quest are the royals and the aristocracy, whose allegiances are to their foreign brethren and who unleash the Austrian army on their fellow Frenchmen; the higher echelons of the army who are aristocratic and defeatist; and the Swiss guards, foreign mercenaries whose fealty is to their employers. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">helper</em> is manifest in Bomier ’ s mother, who allows him to sell the family vineyard to pay off his debts so he can join the march to Paris with the Marseillais volunteers, and the priest who brings sustenance to the troops as they move north in the valley of the Rhone. As an actantial analysis of the film suggests, the narrative of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> is reflexive: the subject, the Marseillais and le Peuple, in the process of defending the revolution, stands as an exemplar of the object, the Nation, and it is therefore not surprising that the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">receiver</em> of the object is the selfsame Nation in all the diversity that its actors represent.</p>
                <p>The narrative project of the film already announces itself in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">distribution</em> of characters in the opening credits, which divides French society at the time of the revolution into social categories: the Court of Louis XVI, Civil and Military Authorities, the Aristocrats, the Marseillais, le Peuple. These abstract social groups will, of course, be transformed by the techniques of cinematic representation: the incarnation of essential characteristics in the bodies of actors and expressive features of mise en scene. The antagonism between social categories is quickly established as the succession of exemplary tableaus that constitute the film unfolds. In the film’ s second sequence, the peasant Anatole Roux is brought to trial by the local lord for killing a pigeon, a crime against aristocratic privilege. Physical and moral traits distinguish the plebian from his titled persecutor. Roux is unkempt in appearance and natural in his demeanor, witty and wily, integrated into the society that witnesses the trial and engineers his escape; the aristocrat, by contrast, is formal in appearance, stiff and haughty in demeanor, humorless, and ineffectual against the wiles and humor of the crowd.</p>
                <p>In the third and fourth major episodes of the film, we find a similar delineation by contrast. The title,“ Marseille October 1790, ” introduces us to a political meeting in which the Marseillais patriots accuse reactionaries in business, political office, and the army of compromising the revolution. Citizen Moissant summarizes, in his impassioned, declamatory style, the situation for the ebullient crowd and calls for taking the forts of Marseille where rebel officers support the reactionaries. The citizens subsequently take possession of the last fort not by violence but through a ruse: the Trojan horse of a cask of wine offered by the city to the fort ’ s occupants conceals a patriot who succeeds in opening the gate for his comrades, who surprise and defeat the reactionary officers without bloodshed. The fourth episode is located at the Hotel Stadt Coblentz, in April 1792, where exiled French aristocrats have sought asylum. Their sorry state is proclaimed by a notice:“ Our gentlemen guests are kindly requested to pay the week in advance.” A melancholic air sung by a bewigged woman in court attire evokes the aristocratic regrets for the France of the old regime; in the atmosphere of trifling activities, the insightful Monsieur de Saint Laurent and the militant Monsieur de Fauguerolles argue about the advantages and dangers of an alliance with the Prussians (even among the doomed class there are sages); a foppish aristocrat attempts to lead the assembled in a gavotte but has forgotten the movements. The Marseillais and the aristocrats serve as foils for each other and bring into relief the contrasting class cultures that characterize them as historical antagonists: the fervor and bonhomie of the rising classes, the lifeless narcissism of the nobility. Moreover, the groups are defined by their allegiances: the Marseillais are partisans of the Nation; the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">aristos</em> ally themselves with their Prussian and Austrian class brothers.</p>
                <p>Among the partisans of the Nation, Renoir is careful to represent the heterogeneity of the group— differences in social position and occupation that are effaced in the overriding camaraderie of the revolutionary movement. These representations conform to a basic typology. Le Roux, the cunning peasant who escaped from the tyranny of aristocratic law, joins a group around a fire in the backcountry that includes Arnaud, an educated clerk, who is the voice of reason and possesses a certain dignity of class; Bomier, a mason who displays the fervent naivete of his popular Marsaillais origins; and Paget, the poor, good-hearted priest who is to be distinguished from his aristocratic and debauched bishop. Humorously contrasted, the characters function as signifiers of diversity. The differences they represent dissolve into the solidarity they adopt against the enemies of the Nation. The depiction of regional difference is equally benevolent. With his commitment to social realism, Renoir delineates and contrasts the linguistic and gestural specificity of his characters. As the battalion of the ebullient Marseillais arrives in the northern capital, where banners on a tribune proclaim “ strength and union,” it encounters the Breton battalion and is immediately integrated into the solidarity of regional forces come there to defend the revolution. The encounter between the Marseillais and le Peuple de Paris is equally felicitous: Bomier the mason falls in love with la Petite Louison, and overcoming regional difference becomes as easy as the Marseillais learning to eat the exotic potato.</p>
                <p>There is no need to multiply the examples, which are obvious in their intent. Renoir ’ s film ceaselessly works on the social and cultural categories: those that are irredeemably oppositional and those that are capable of assimilation. We are dealing here with a representation of historical actors that emerges from the nationalist school of history that belonged to the Third Republic: a history that sacrifices social and cultural differences to its political project. In his analysis of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">manuels</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scolaires</em> published between 1884 and 1914, Guy Bourde shows how French history is written in terms of the forces that lead to the ultimate victory of the Republic and those that constitute obstacles to this final realization of “ eternal France” :</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The inhabitants of this beautiful country belong to a collectivity that progressively becomes national. Nothing really distinguishes them from each other: regional characteristics are effaced; social inequalities are blurred. The“ others,” the different individuals, are identified with foreigners, enemies, aggressors. The long march toward the formation of the Nation-State unfolds like a succession of exceptional events in which virtuous heroes distinguish themselves.30</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In certain passages <em class="notranslate" translate="no">, La Marseillaise</em> ’ s depiction of exceptional events seems to imitate the “ picture gallery” format of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">manuels scolaires,</em> the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Petit Lavisse</em> and its imitators: a rhetorical strategy that reduces complex historical situations to conventional imagery. The film’ s episodic quality reinforces this impression by separating the narrative into isolated moments. The major narrative segments are chronologically ordered and frequently dated, but they often lack the kind of narrative continuity between sequences typical of the fiction film. Each episode takes on an emblematic character: the actions represented and the characters, with their“ typical” physiognomies and gestures, stand for the contending forces of the revolution. In the film’ s first sequence, for example, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt announces the fall of the Bastille to Louis XVI, who receives the news reclining in bed, a chicken leg raised to his mouth. This is the image, bristling with irony and humor, of the inept and distracted king focused on his own pleasures. Renoir ’ s Louis XVI is perhaps well-meaning, sentimentally attached to his people, but he cannot master events and will be led to betrayal by the pressure of a heartless and malevolent queen— that Austrian and enemy of France who will browbeat the king into signing the repressive measures of the Brunswick Manifesto. The film reprises from nineteenth-century historians certain telling gestures and words that seem to confirm Renoir’ s depiction of the king ’ s personality and his destiny. Louis ’ s wig is askew as he reviews the Garde Nationale just before the insurgents attack the Tuileries, and as the royal family crosses the Tuileries gardens on their way to the National Assembly to seek asylum from the insurrection, Louis remarks that the leaves have begun to fall early this year.</p>
                <p>In his effort to give figurative representation (in the sense the term has in painting) to the forces that become the Nation, Renoir relies on specific filmic strategies. As I argue in Chapter Four, devoted to the problems of historical rhetoric in film, filmmakers who seek to recount collective actions performed by collective actors are obliged to develop techniques of representation that countervail the tendency of the filmic image toward the specific and concrete. Master of the telling detail, Renoir ’ s constant concern is to negotiate between the particular (the actor ’ s individual physiognomy, the concrete and circumscribed locations, the depiction of singular actions) and the general (the anonymous group, the broad historical space of events, and the collective nature of historical action). In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> , the particular is the individual, endowed with a proper name, who appears and reappears in the development of the narrative and whose personal destiny becomes a matter of concern to the spectator. The general exists in the representation of the mass, which cannot be identified by a proper name or a personal history; the crowd’ s identity is specified, rather, by signifiers of class and social position, regional characteristics, and political allegiance. For Renoir, the particular is essential in presenting the human face of the historical actant and in soliciting the spectator ’ s identification with the collectivity. The general provides the historical dimension of events and the historical impact of individual action. This alternating evocation of the specific and the general resembles the rhetorical figure of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">zeugma</em> , the“ grammatical coordination of two words that possess opposed semantic features,” often the abstract and the concrete.31</p>
                <p>Articulating the specific with the general and the concrete with the abstract is a central preoccupation of Renoir’ s films of the 1930s and is particularly visible in his use of the moving camera and deepfocus cinematography allied with the long take. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> , this strategy is one of the underpinnings of Renoir’ s historic vision. One of the clearest examples — and the most virtuosic— is the scene of the departure of the Marseillais volunteers, which is made up of a single shot and exploits the linking function of the moving camera and deepfocus mise en scene. The shot begins in the treetops— the dappled sunlight on the bark of plane trees that signifies Provence, where a banner floats, proclaiming:“ Volunteers of Marseille — to Paris to save (to indicate that the rest of banner’ s message is not visible). ” A young boy straddles a limb watching the events unfold in the square. The assembled intone “ La Marseillaise.” The camera begins a fluid movement at a high angle above the crowd, tracking into closer views of the smiling and singing crowd. The camera lingers a moment on the face of a young girl in her white bonnet, a man in his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">chapeau bicorne</em> kissing women goodbye, the song leader singing the next verse— all briefly focalized by a slowing movement of the camera. Bomier the mason comes into view with his mother behind him: she falls to her knees and Bomier stoops to comfort her. A circle of distraught women takes up the emotion of Bomier ’ s mother, grouped around a bright spot of light and dappled shade.</p>
                <p>The camera swings around and approaches Bomier and his comrade Cuguliere, who initiates a snatch of dialogue:“ Tu chantes?” ( “ You’ re singing? ” ). Bomier, still hiding his love of the anthem of the revolution, replies, “ Je chante pour faire comme tout le monde” ( “ I sing to be like everyone else ” )— words that epitomize the film ’ s project. Bomier takes his leave, and the camera remains static as Arnaud and other volunteers pass by and kiss Bomier ’ s mother. Thus, the figurative strategy that individualizes the actors and links them in a chain of solidarity is embodied in the unity of the long take with its“ democratic” moving camera and the deep focus that contextualizes every action and gesture.</p>
                <p>In the representation of the march on Paris, Renoir juxtaposes two types of representation to achieve a similar integration between the general and the particular. The first is the depiction of the mass— the straggling line of soldiers seen in long and very long shots; the second is the depiction of individual actions, captured in brief scenes made up of several shots. Thus, for example, we watch Bomier attempting to master the “ Marseillaise” and Javel fuming about reactionary priests, while Arnaud reminds him of the positive role priests play in the revolution (an example of the film ’ s reconciliation of contradictions). The scene is a moment of continuous development, but even while Renoir seems to center our interest on a particular action and particular characters he insists on contextualizing the focalization. For example, after an interchange between volunteers about the best way to stuff their boots, the camera becomes distracted by an“ anonymous” soldier passing through the frame and shifts to follow him. It is important for Renoir to show that Bomier, Arnaud, and their comrades are not exceptional heroes, and that the crowd generates such individuals constantly, as if the camera needs only tarry a bit in one part or another of the immense field of history for such individuals to emerge. The principle of the historical individual is that he is representative and therefore replicable.</p>
                <p>Another type of reconciliation between the particular and the general occurs within a single shot through the artifice of deep-focus mise en scene. In the massacre of the invaders of the Tuileries by the Swiss Guard, Arnaud is hit and Bomier mortally wounded. We witness Bomier, pulled into the courtyard of a building, dying in his sweetheart’ s arms, but the personal suffering of that moment is already contextualized: beyond the pieta composed of Louison and Bomier and through the carriage gate, we continue to witness in deep focus the vicissitudes of the battle as the insurgents first retreat and then return victorious. We soon learn that the palace has been taken, the Swiss executed, and the king deposed.</p>
                <p>The film ends at the front where the Marseillais defend their freedom against the foreign invader, and here the historical past and the crisis of 1938 occupy the same scene of representation. A title announces the French victory against the Prussian army at Valmy and cites Goethe, who was present: “ In this place and on this day began a new period in the history of the world.” While <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> conjures the defeat of Prussia in 1792, the smoke of war is barely lifting, as if this great moment of closure opens onto a new period of danger for the republic. As the German armies mass on the borders of France in 1938, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Marseillaise</em> calls on all French citizens, in memory of the revolution, to forget their differences of class and culture and to rally to the collective defense of the Nation.</p>
                <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Case Study: Standing for the Revolution—Mikh ail Kalatozov’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cub a</em> (1964)</strong></p>
                <p>Russian filmmaker Mikhail Kalatozov began work in 1962 on the Soviet-Cuban production (Mosfilm and ICAIC) that would become <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Soy Cuba.</em> It would be based on a text by poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Cuban writer Enrique Barnet. Kalatozov was to work with cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky; their collaboration on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cranes Are</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Flying</em> (1957) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Letter Never Sent</em> (1960) had already shown an extraordinary combination of vision and technique. Kalatozov (born in 1908) was inspired by the example of Sergei Eisenstein in his ambition to create an epic film of the Cuban revolution based on an innovative cinematic “ language.” Preproduction took more than a year, during which the director, his cinematographer, and the two writers researched the film in Cuba, carefully structured the script, and planned the visual effects. Actual work began a year after the Bay of Pigs debacle and shortly after the Cuban missile crisis had awakened the world to the reality of the nuclear threat.</p>
                <p>The press packet for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> describes the film as a“ wildly schizophrenic celebration of Communist kitsch, mixing Slavic solemnity with Latin sensuality. ” 32 This characterization seems fashioned to cover the embarrassing gap between its initial release, at a moment when Castro ’ s Cuba still represented for many a socially progressive regime, and its American distribution some thirty years later when the collapse of the Soviet Union and revelations about how Castro’ s revolution had become another brand of Stalinism served to undercut its historical relevance and relegate it to the realm of dated propaganda. The film ’ s release under the patronage of American auteurists Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese signaled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> as an aesthetic event, which indeed it was, and critics considered the film significant, not for its representation of the Cuban revolution, but for its spectacular cinematic and formal qualities (“ Visually Staggering,” “ ecstatic,” “ delirious” ). Could one see in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> simply a recent example of that process described by Gerard Genette in which the pragmatic urgency — the“ relevance”— of a text is eroded by time and the work survives on its aesthetic merits?</p>
                <p>I don ’ t think so. I argue that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> is a superb example of historical representation in cinema. In the following analysis, I consider how the film organizes the event-worthy field of the Cuban revolution and, in particular, how it constructs characters that are both historiographically and cinematically coherent.</p>
                <p> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> is divided into a prologue and four parts. The prologue evokes the beauty of pre-Columbian Cuba, rendering the island through a telescoping of scales: grandiose helicopter shots over the island are almost geographical in scope; as the helicopter descends, the palm trees can be distinguished, shot with infrared film stock that gives them a ghostly look; then, the constantly moving camera descends to skim the earth from a skiff that gives us views of villagers engaged in daily activities. The text speaks of Christopher Columbus, the happiness of Cubans at the time of his landing, and the tears shed as Cuban sugar is opened to colonial exploitation.</p>
                <p>Each of the four parts of the narrative focuses on a particular location, a particular social group, and a particular moment in the development of the revolutionary struggle. The first section evokes the city of Havana in the 1950s as a colonial playground where rich businessmen pursue Cuban women, victims of the island’ s poverty who are forced to submit to degradation and self-denial. The film focuses on a particular victim, Maria (also known as Betty), who represents not only colonialism ’ s degraded women in Havana’ s pleasure industry, but, through metonymic extension, the plight of the urban poor who inhabit the same Havana shantytown.</p>
                <p>The second section moves to rural Cuba, where the film recounts the ruination of an old peasant named Pedro, who stands for his social class in the manner of the allegorical figure. Unknowingly, he relinquishes the rights to the land he cultivates with a thumbprint on a document the landowner persuades him to“ sign.” The landowner, a powerful armed figure on horseback, sells the land to United Fruit, and the disenfranchised Pedro torches his house and fields rather than allow his work to be appropriated by foreign interests.</p>
                <p>The third section recounts the revolutionary student movement in Havana and centers on the character Enrique, who represents the students ’ revolutionary commitment to support Castro ’ s insurgency and bring down the Batista government. He also embodies the ideological conflicts of the movement: is it morally or tactically correct for Enrique to assassinate a sadistic police officer responsible for the death of his comrades? As he becomes the symbolic center of a demonstration, Enrique marches to his own death at the hands of the same police officer.</p>
                <p>The fourth section describes the insurgency in the Sierra Maestre. A poor peasant, Mariano, stands for the emerging revolutionary consciousness of his class. In the first sequence, Mariano invites an exhausted insurgent to eat with him, but when Mariano sees the soldier’ s rifle, he asks him to leave his home because, he says, he wants to live in peace. In the second sequence, Mariano’ s house is demolished in a bomb raid by Batista forces, and one of Mariano’ s children is killed. Radicalized by events, Mariano decides to join the insurgency. In the third sequence, Mariano finds Castro’ s troops and meets again the rebel soldier he threw out of his house. The soldier tells him,“ I knew you would come. ” Mariano captures a gun in battle. The film ends in a propagandistic flourish: the guerrillas march triumphantly toward revolutionary victory. (A fifth segment of the original screenplay on “ the struggle on the plains” was never shot.)</p>
                <p>This brief synopsis of the action reveals several important aspects of the film ’ s narrative design and the way it organizes the historical events.</p>
                <p>First, it is helpful to recall Ann Rigney’ s analysis of the narrative operation in history as a process of inclusion and exclusion or Paul Veyne ’ s notion of an itinerary the historian constructs across an eventworthy field. The historian includes certain actions and certain actors while he relegates others to the background or simply excludes them. Such narrative choices construct a reading of historical events and simultaneously position the reader/spectator in relation to them.</p>
                <p>This essential historiographical operation is at work in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba.</em> The prologue sets up the long historical view: pre-Columbian Cuba is a paradise lost in which a harmonious relationship between a land and its people prevails. Disrupted by the Columbian discovery, Cuba is opened to the West and to a history of exploitation and suffering. The brutal transition from the idyllic landscapes of the prologue to the raucous rock-and-roll trio and the vulgar beauty pageant on the terrace of a Havana high-rise indicates that the film will take up Cuban history after Batista ’ s coup d’ etat of 1952. The first two parts of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> describe Cuba under the sway of American investments: the American mafia’ s transformation of Havana into a playground for Western businessmen and American corporations ’ exploitation of Cuban agriculture. Thus, through a work of condensation, the economic and human exploitation represented in parts 1 and 2, held in place, as we see in part 3, by a repressive state apparatus, stands for the revolutionary imperative.</p>
                <p>The structure of causality in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> is then quite simple: the historic circumstances that constitute the prerevolutionary situation described in parts 1 and 2 provoke the revolutionary actions undertaken in parts 3 and 4: the student movement engages in militant action, disseminates propaganda, and battles Bastista’ s repressive police force; a peasant exposed to the violence of military repression is radicalized and joins the insurgency in the Sierra Maestra that will lead to revolutionary victory. Moreover, the four parts of the film are organized around a geographical alternation between the city and the countryside: the two spheres of oppression and revolutionary action. The scenario of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> is the result of what Robert Rosenstone has called the work of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">condensation</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">compression</em> , in which large-scale historical situations and events are synthesized or represented symbolically. As I have suggested, this work of symbolization is often founded on the figure of the synecdoche, in which the part stands for the whole, the particular for the general.</p>
                <p>Second, each of the four parts of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> is a distinct narrative development that shows no immediate relationship to the others. There is no stable configuration of characters: with one minor exception, the protagonists act within the context of one of the four sections of the film and do not recur. They do not, in the manner of fiction, carry the action forward as the agents of continuity. Characters appear and disappear from the scene of representation according to the historical logic the film imposes. In terms of plot, there is no specific chain of cause and effect that links, in the manner of fiction, one part to the next. This episodic structure stems from the ambition of Kalatozov and his collaborators to construct collective, not individual, characters. The writers ’ intention was not“ to elevate any one individual … , but to show the ‘ historic necessity of the people’ s break from Batista’ s American-backed government.’” 33</p>
                <p>Third, despite the episodic nature of characters and actions, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cuba</em> is a coherent narrative. That coherence does not exist at the level of the actors, conceived as individual protagonists occurring on the surface of the narrative; it depends, rather, on the deep structural organization of narrative functions, like the one I suggested for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La</em> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marseillaise</em> . Using the categories of the actantial model, I propose the following simple analysis of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> : (a) The subject of the narrative is the revolutionary actor, embodied in student militants Enrique, Alberto, and others; the peasant Mariano after his radicalization; and the insurgent army. (b) The object sought by the subject is the end of neocolonial exploitation and the revolutionary transformation of Cuban society. (c) The senders (the motivators of the action) are the figures of the oppressed embodied in the film’ s passive or defeated characters, particularly Maria/Betty, the unwilling prostitute, and her neighbors, other shantytown dwellers; Gloria, who is aggressed upon by American sailors and protected by student militant Enrique; and Pedro the exploited peasant. (d) The opponents who act to thwart the pursuit of the object are the instruments of oppression or repression: pleasure-seeking businessmen, United Fruit and big landowners, the sadistic policeman who shoots students, Batista, the government’ s military forces, and so forth. (e) The helpers include Rene, the fruit salesman in love with Maria; the street singer whose voice dissuades Enrique from killing the police officer; Gloria, who calls out to Enrique during the fatal demonstration; and the rebel soldier, who represents for Mariano the necessity of armed struggle. (f) The receivers of the object (fruits of revolution) are the exploited and oppressed masses represented in the film by the victimized women, the urban poor, the exploited peasants, the cigar factory workers, among others.</p>
                <p>What allows us to move immediately from the actorial to the functional levels of the narrative is the fact that the characters in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> are all <em class="notranslate" translate="no">entities of participatory belonging</em> , to use Paul Ricoeur ’ s formulation. Each character is not simply an individual actor but embodies the characteristics of the social group to which he belong; each action takes place simultaneously in the circumscribed space of the scene and on the more abstract stage of history. I propose to analyze one such historical character: Maria/Betty, the unwilling prostitute of part 1.</p>
                <p>In Chapter Two, I cited Francis Vanoye’ s analysis of the differences between written and filmic discourses. If the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">substance of the content</em> (actors, events, ideas, and so on) are common to both mediums, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">forms of expression</em> are radically different. Thus, when I describe a character like Maria/Betty in narrative or symbolic terms, as I did in the previous paragraphs, I am talking about a content that could take cinematic or written form. In analyzing <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba,</em> it is important to grasp how the film expresses this character, how it establishes her relationship to her social category, and how it constructs her symbolic position.</p>
                <p>I begin with the observation that the film is not discursive in the usual sense: the voice-over is quite discreet and does not constantly intrude to organize events or to comment on the characters and their actions. In the part we are considering, it intervenes only at the very end of the last sequence and speaks its mind directly to the fleeing pleasure-seeker, Jim, who is nothing more than a dot on the shot’ s horizon. The events that take place in part 1 are apparently singulative rather than iterative (single occurrences rather than repeated ones), and as representations of individual actions, they all have great“ signifying relief. ” History in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> is expressed scenically, that is, through filmic sequences we take to be quite continuous in time and space. Ann Rigney observes that such moments of textual expansion in written history (compared with moments that are presented more generally or more elliptically) are“ the locus of the heaviest symbolic and rhetorical investment on the part of the historian.” 34 Historical representation in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> operates in exactly that manner: while the continuous sequences seem to give us depictions of specific places, characters, and actions, the film invests these depictions with symbolic and rhetorical significance.</p>
                <p>Thus, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba</em> cannot be read according to the well defined codes of cinematic representation; indeed, the film is highly experimental and constantly breaks from the norms of film practice in commercial cinema. It is this deviation that accounts for the film’ s rhetorical power. The most obvious areas of innovation include Mikhail Kalatozov’ s expressionistic mise en scene, abetted by Cuban painter Rene Portocarrero; the dazzling effects of Sergei Urushevsky’ s mobile camera and long takes; and the radical experimentation on the relation between sound and image, including the poetic dual-language voice-over and the “ unrealistic” synchronization of sound.</p>
                <p>Part 1 of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Am Cuba,</em> which features Maria/Betty, is made up of four segments. In segment 1, the central protagonist, Maria/Betty, does not appear. It opens instead with a black singer caught in the expressionistic mise en scene of a Havana nightclub: we see him from a very high angle, framed by bamboo curtains and lit with dramatic source lighting. The sense of composition is strong: unsettling diagonal lines and the dark masking of portions of the image suggest the projection of an inner vision. The singer is dwarfed by a“ primitive” statue, which, along with other elements of the decor, introduces the theme of exoticism. Exoticism, which in its most positive sense can be the experience of difference, loses here all authenticity. Exoticism is the mise en scene of the “ native,” the Western projection onto the Other of all the attributes of the “ savage” (Gauguin expressed his desire to escape from Western bourgeois culture and morality as,“ I want to go live among the savages. ” ). The native takes on the traits the Westerner denies in himself: primeval appetites, the reign of the instinctual over the rational or the moral.</p>
                <p>As the camera follows him in a very long take, the singer (played by the former falsetto lead of the Platters) sings, strangely out of synch, a song about “ Loco Amor” : unbridled love, the eroticism that is inseparable from the experience of the exotic and that can be indulged precisely because of the native object’ s presumed primitivism. As he moves away from the camera, we see that a white mask is affixed to the back of his tuxedo. The racial theme (the reference is to Franz Fanon’ s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Black Skin, White Mask</em> ) is allied to the theme of exhibitionism: I exhibit (and betray) myself as the mask of the exotic Other the customer desires. The camera continues to track the singer as he moves behind a bar, his white mask striking in profile; in the foreground, we are given medium shots of beautiful women of color in evening gowns seated at the bar: the feminine Other offers up her body as a spectacle of difference, a commodity to be consumed.</p>
                <p>The camera climbs again to a high angle and searches out a table of three white businessmen, framed as before in emphatic fashion by a bamboo curtain and the play of light and shadow. A waiter stands ready to take their order. The camera moves to a medium close shot of one of the businessmen in sunglasses, who looks offscreen and says, referring to a woman seated at the bar,“ I’ ll take that tasty morsel. ” A second businessman approaches him from behind and says lubriciously: “ And I’ ll take that dish. ” The singer finishes his act kneeling on the floor. Are his contorted gestures signs of mad love or of agonizing self-denial? (His performance anticipates Betty’ s dance in segment 3.) The camera tilts up to reveal the group of businessmen and the women they have chosen. One of them says,“ Nothing is indecent in Cuba if you ’ ve got the dough.” The sequence ends with a dance that combines themes of exoticism, eroticism, and the duplicity of the masked face. A line of women dancers in “ primitive” costumes that leave their bodies nearly naked surround the businessmen, and as they exit the frame, each removes her mask to briefly reveal her face to the camera.</p>
                <p>What is striking about the first nightclub sequence is the figurative quality of its mise en scene: the setting, the characters, and their actions are intended to be read symbolically. The nightclub is not so much a credible space as a vision of a colonial netherworld where the characters take their place in a symbolic drama of exploitation. The American businessmen are near caricatures whose vulgarity and insensitivity are signifiers of the heartlessness of colonial exploitation. The Cubans — performers for hire— play the parts assigned to them by Western exoticism, their self-denial the price of their“ participation” in a colonial economy. The symbolic relationship in which a specific aspect of setting or specific characters and their actions represent larger historical situations and events is well expressed in Ricoeur’ s notion of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">standing for</em> . The three remaining segments continue to play on the figurative possibilities of mise en scene.</p>
                <p>In the second segment, everything about the mise en scene is antithetical to the first segment: the location is exterior, not interior; the lighting is dazzling in its brightness, not dramatic and low key; the vistas are open, not claustrophobic. These qualities are immediately perceived as the symbolic matrix within which we see Maria for the first time. Identified with light and openness, she bears the name of womanly purity. However, the light/dark antithesis evident in the contrasting mise en scene of the first and second segments is recalled by Maria ’ s costume: she wears a white scarf that contrasts with her dark dress, suggesting the paradox of her dual identity (Maria/Betty). The long takes persist, but as the camera shows us Maria and her fiance, Rene the fruit seller, it moves horizontally and gives us eye-level views of the couple, suggesting the normalcy of their relationship. Rene, the honest worker whose vendor’ s song contrasts with the nightclub singer ’ s, is connected to the revolution; he is a helper and conceals papers (leaflets?) in his fruit cart for student militants. As the camera focuses on Rene, it tilts up so that he is dominated by the white cathedral, from which we hear a passage of organ music. Rene sings to Maria — once again the voice strangely out of synch with the image of the singer — and tells her they will be married there, and that she will wear a white dress. He moves around his cart and chooses a single piece of fruit, a tangerine, whose significance is emphasized by an extended close-up, and gives it to Maria. Maria slips out of frame, in a movement that suggests her discomfort. We are left with a view of Rene, set against the cathedral’ s facade, as he says: “ I love you. Maria! Maria! Maria! ”</p>
                <p>A fourth call to Maria is heard over the first image of segment 3: a close-up of Maria, framed by a bamboo curtain in the low-key lighting we recognize from the nightclub of segment 1. She is now dressed in black evening clothes appropriate to the milieu; the only discordant note is the shining crucifix she wears. She moves behind the alreadyfamiliar bar; a woman calls her name,“ Betty!” (the generic moniker for the Latin American female) and ushers her into the company of the American businessmen we met in the first segment. The impact is startling because we already know this particular hell and because the chromatic (and symbolic) contrasts with the previous sequence condense into an instant our recognition of the story of this fallen woman. She carries into the scene two symbolic objects: the first is the tangerine, the gift of love, which she puts into her purse as one man jokes about it; the second is the crucifix, a sign of purity and resistance, which draws the attention of Jim, the least coarse of the three businessmen.</p>
                <p>The game of seduction continues. By lot, Jim draws Betty as his dancing partner. The dance itself stages Betty’ s emotional experience of her fall: she resists Jim, but as the dance becomes frenetic, she loses control and is thrown from one partner to the next. Betty’ s torment is emphasized by a series of frenzied movements toward the camera, which catches her momentarily in close-up. Then, somehow Betty is extricated from her partners’ aggression; the swing music is muted, and we hear instead the rhythm of bongo drums. She dances alone as if carried away by some primitive instinct, her face revealing her torment. Close-ups of Betty’ s frenzied dance alternate with tracking shots of the grotesque onlookers egging her on. She dances around the “ primitive” statue from segment 1 as the crowd chants, “ Betty, Betty, Betty! ” We cut to the entrance of the nightclub, where the Americans are leaving with their women. Jim tells Betty it would be“ interesting” to see her place.</p>
                <p>Maria/Betty is a symbolic entity: she both suffers and resists and thus stands for the collectivity of exploited women— most immediately, the category of women who line the bar in the nightclub scenes. The symbolic function of the character does not, however, suppress the character ’ s other functions. It is also the filmmakers ’ intention to represent in Maria/Betty the experience of oppression from“ inside,” that is, the (historically real) struggles and suffering of women defeated by the overpowering effects of poverty. These sequences do what cinema does very well: they call on us to identify with the subjectivity of a character, whose plight gives us access to the emotional cost of exploitation. Can such empathy be considered historical? I would argue that the representations of Maria/Betty’ s psychological state are part of what philosopher R. G. Collingwood calls the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a priori imagination.</em> We observe the existence of the top of a table, and we imagine the necessary existence of its underside. As Collingwood suggests,“ We cannot but imagine what cannot but be there.” 35 In the same manner, we know through the factual record that women in Havana were exploited in the sexual trades. We are therefore authorized to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">imagine</em> the necessary historical reality of their suffering.</p>
                <p>In segment 4, a taxi ride during which Betty demurs from Jim’ s advances serves as a transition between the place of exotic spectacle and the “ real” social space of Betty ’ s ghetto existence. Paradoxically, the shantytown, which one might think would be treated in a realist manner, is rendered in an expressionist mise en scene that is as distorted as that of the nightclub. The enormous American taxi comes to a stop in the middle of an immense puddle, the car’ s length exaggerated by a wide-angle lens. Jim ’ s initiation to the underside of colonialism is fraught with discomfiture. He and Betty make their way into this new symbolic space by stepping from stone to stone across a flooded landscape. The deliberately artificial lighting design, which resembles something out of a Murnau film, allows the couple’ s image to be reflected in the water and justifies the kind of self-conscious framing and masking we saw in the segments in the nightclub. The set design is also theatrical in character: the shanties, far from being realistically rendered, are constructed as images; their most salient feature is the tangle of power poles that give the impression of disjointed crosses— another example of symbolic mise en scene. Inside Betty’ s shack, seduction and resistance center on the crucifix that Jim admires. Betty removes it; Jim tries to replace it around her neck, but she throws it on the floor and gives vent to her anguish by beating on the wall. She turns back to Jim and slips her dress off her shoulders. Jim turns off the light.</p>
                <p>In the second sequence, we see in daylight a chair on which Betty has placed objects from the night before: her handbag, the pearls that decorated her hair, and two keys to the symbolic drama, the crucifix and the partially eaten tangerine. Jim’ s hand enters the frame and picks up a piece of the tangerine, and the panning camera follows the movement from hand to mouth. With nonchalance, Jim goes about the usual rituals of the morning after: he combs his hair, leaves money on the pillow of the sleeping Betty, returns to the chair, and picks up another piece of tangerine and the crucifix. He says to her,“ I would like to buy this. ” When she refuses, he simply adds more bills to those already on the pillow and pockets the crucifix. We hear the voice-off of Rene ’ s vendor’ s song. A striking deep-focus composition condenses all the tension of the moment of discovery: Betty in the foreground covers her nakedness with a sheet, Jim is in the middle ground adjusting his suit jacket, and Rene is framed in the brightly lit doorway in the background. Rene approaches Betty and faces down Jim in a close shot, which through a rack focus effect emphasizes Jim’ s uneasiness. Rene turns back to Betty, and we see Jim in depth waving from the doorway: “ Goodbye, Betty.” Rene exclaims, “ Betty?” and then moves toward the door. The camera tracks in to a prolonged close-up of the distraught Betty. The filmmaker’ s choice to represent Maria/Betty ’ s fall in Christian and specifically Latin terms of purity and sin serves to intensify woman ’ s experience of colonial oppression because her own culture cannot forgive the fall, even when it is imposed by the conditions of neocolonialism.</p>
                <p>If Betty ’ s drama has ended, Jim’ s is about to begin, and it is at this moment that the film generalizes the symbolic references to the effects of neocolonialism on urban life in Cuba. What happens when colonial insouciance is forced to face the human costs of indifference? The sequence begins with a close-up of Jim, who unwraps a candy and puts it in his mouth, oblivious to his surroundings. The beginning of a nervous jazz piece challenges his composure. Jim is suddenly thrown into an expressionist nightmare: he is caught in the labyrinthine ghetto, hemmed in by a narrow passageway and threatening darkness. When he reemerges into the light he is pursued by a boy and stumbles about in a warren of cactuses and shanties. In long shot, we see him surrounded by begging children: “ Money, Mister!” The tracking camera follows the frantic Jim looking for an exit, but endowed with sensitivity, as it passes ghetto residents, the camera’ s attention is drawn to them: an anguished mother with her child, an old man with a cigar, children staring out of what appears to be a cage, a woman and her child washing bottles in a bucket. The hysterical Jim finds himself face to face with an old man. At this moment, the camera rises in a crane shot higher and higher above the rooftops, where old tires hold down tar paper, until we have an extreme high-angle shot of Jim’ s escape toward the horizon, his route marked by ghetto figures who gaze after him. The voice-over returns: “ I am Cuba. Why are you running away? … Don ’ t avert your eyes. Look! I am Cuba. For you, I am the casino, the bar, hotels and brothels. But the hands of these children and old people are also me. I am Cuba. ”</p>
