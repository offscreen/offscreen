                </header>
                <p>To begin with, it is important to address the very inclusion of a chapter of this nature in this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Handbook</em>. This clarification is necessary because Jung is not particularly known for his contribution either to epistemology or to methodology. Jung is widely known mainly for a number of innovations which do not include his epistemological expertise; mostly, these contributions are connected with the content of his theories (i.e., he introduced new theoretical ideas e.g., about the collective unconscious and the archetypes, etc.), his particular approach to psychotherapy (e.g., he advocated not to reject the symptom but to endeavour to find meaning and value in it), and the implications of his ideas to wider existential and cultural considerations. Epistemology and methodology are not areas that are usually associated with Jung. Yet, this chapter will argue that if one were to read Jung in a certain way, one would find important epistemological and methodological insights; moreover, it will be further argued that these insights are of relevance today and they can enrich substantially current debates in these fields.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Difficulties</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Several difficulties could be identified in the undertaking of the task of discerning Jung’s epistemological contribution. The first has to do with the basic fact that Jung did not write clearly and specifically about epistemology and methodology; whenever he addressed these issues he did so in passing, in the context of writing about something else. This means that his insights on epistemological and methodological matters were interwoven into the very fabric of his theories and his overall psychology and, therefore, would require a special extraction procedure to be brought to light in order to be examined in their own right. Related to this difficulty is another consideration, i.e., by formulating his insights in his usual idiosyncratic language (which was tightly interconnected within his theories), Jung’s implications for epistemology are not easily noticeable either by the specialist epistemologists or by the majority of Jungian psychologists; the former would not even look in Jung’s writings for this kind of information, and the focus of the latter has been mainly on his innovative contributions to the theory and practice of psychotherapy.</p>
                <p>Another difficulty in developing Jung’s contribution to epistemology and methodology is that such an activity would seemingly contradict Jung’s own strong views about the very essence of his work. Jung is known for being adverse to any suggestion that his theoretical formulation could be separated from his overall psychology. More specifically, he detested the idea that his work could be considered as constituting any ‘free-standing’ philosophical statement, abstracted, distinct and independent from its clinical-therapeutic context: ‘I have set up neither a system nor a general theory, but have merely formulated auxiliary concepts to serve me as tools as is customary in every branch of science’ (Jung 1952a: par. 1507).</p>
                <p>Evidently, Jung perceived a sharp distinction between two possible ways that his work could be understood: according to the first one, his work was ‘empirical’ and grounded on solid clinical observations; and, according to the second one, his work was a collection of philosophical speculations and abstractions unrelated to the clinical realities. Throughout his life and in his writings, Jung struggled to gain legitimacy for his work and endeavoured to condemn strongly the latter position and did everything he could to convince others to espouse the former position. However, this sharp distinction presents two difficulties: first, according to the latter view, any philosophical relevance that Jung’s work could have possible had was dismissed as being ‘philosophical speculation’; this means that this sharp distinction does not allow for any positive appreciation of anything that could be considered even remotely connected with philosophy. Consequently, all possible epistemological and methodological insights were tainted as being philosophical and were, thus, rejected by Jung. Second, surely, this sharp distinction cannot be definitive, regardless of how it is understood. In other words, any comprehension and (more so) any presentation of ‘empirical’ ‘facts’ inevitably involves theoretical and philosophical assumptions that need to be taken on board.</p>
                <p>This means that Jung’s very perception of his work (in terms of this sharp distinction) prevented him (and others after him) from appreciating any contribution he made which could have been construed as being ‘philosophical’. More specifically, throughout, Jung was particularly concerned not to venture into anything that he considered that could dilute the validity of his psychological work and in doing so, in effect, he minimised the importance of the epistemological implications of his work. Moreover, it seems that, even when he was aware of the epistemological impact of his formulations, somehow, Jung perceived them as an integral part of his overall theoretical approach (which, indeed, they were) and, consequently, he did not flag out their importance, in their own right.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, the main objectives of this chapter are to attempt, first, to argue that Jung indeed had a remarkable epistemological sensitivity and vigilance, second, to delineate those parts of his work that could convey his epistemological awareness and to develop them into a more coherent formulation, third, to trace his epistemological development through the different phases of his career and the way this development interacted with his wider theoretical formulations and with his own life, and finally to examine the present-day relevance of his epistemological contribution in the light of wider developments and current debates in this field. Needless to say, these objectives will have to be scaled down considerably in scope in order to fit within the space limitations of a single chapter.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Before going any further, it will be important to develop a working understanding of what is meant by epistemology and methodology. As their respective fields are vast and there are many technical definitions of both of them, it will be useful to limit our understanding to a working conception of them, for the purposes of this chapter.</p>
                <p>Epistemology is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">logos</em> of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em>. The Greek <em class="notranslate" translate="no">logos</em> is often translated as study, science, discipline, systematic investigation and discourse. In Greek, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> means knowledge but, not surprisingly, it has an interesting history and a wide range of meanings; the Latin equivalent, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scientia</em>, does not seem to share this rich philosophical past.</p>
                <p>Etymologically, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> is related to the verbs <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ephistemi</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">epistamai</em> which mean ‘to set or place upon’ and ‘to know how’, respectively. Both verbs refer to standing over or upon (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">epi</em>) implying some king of ‘overseeing’ activity. Whereas in English to understand is signified by ‘standing under’, in Greek it is by standing over, above. The noun <em class="notranslate" translate="no">epistema</em> is ‘anything set up, e.g., a monument over a grave’ (Liddell and Scott 1869: 575). Therefore, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> could be understood as the act of marking a territory that was observed and comprehended.</p>
                <p>There is long debate about the meaning of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> in ancient Greek philosophy (mainly in Plato and Aristotle). This is mainly in connection to its opposition to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">techne</em> (which is often translated as art, craft or practice). In short, the general trend has been to attribute <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> to knowledge of pure theory and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">techne</em> to the know-how connected with practice and application. In other words, the predominant tradition has been to equate episteme to theoretical knowledge and techne to applied technology. This is reflected somehow in the old division between a university and a polytechnic (in Greek <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pan-epistemeion</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Poly-techneion</em>). However, this sharp distinction is not always valid. For example, Plato has Socrates clarifying that the knowledge (episteme) of health is the medical craft (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">techne</em>) of the physician (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Charmides</em>, 165c). In other words, according to Socrates, applied and theoretical knowledge are not in a mutually excluding and oppositional relationship.</p>
                <p>This debate is not unrelated to Jung’s own understanding of knowledge and craft in psychology and psychotherapy. For example, Michael Whan (1987) suggests that Jung’s approach transcends the opposition between <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">techne</em> and proposes the term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">phronesis</em> as the most appropriate term that characterises the Jungian approach. Thus, for Whan, Jungian therapeutic practice is not based either on ‘theoretical knowledge’ or on ‘technical knowledge’ but on an awareness which he terms ‘ethical consciousness’. In fact, the ethical consideration has been proposed as a dominant epistemological drive in mental health care, in general (and not only in relation to the Jungian approach) and as superseding the perceived dichotomy between <em class="notranslate" translate="no">techne</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> (Crowden 2003). Needless to say, Jung would have strongly agreed that an ethical stance cannot be divorced from epistemological and technical considerations; indeed, on numerous occasions he emphasised this very point (e.g., Jung 1949: par. 1412, 1934a: par. 315; McFarland Solomon and Twyman 2003; von Franz 1975).</p>
                <p>The reference to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em> vs <em class="notranslate" translate="no">techne</em> in the context of the Jungian approach is indicative of the complexities involved in delineating boundaries between the various disciplines; these debates, of course, are not limited only to the therapeutic realm. Indeed, the problematic acceptance of knowledge outside the framework of ethical perspectives is universal and it affects most areas of human activity. Characteristically, Levinas proposed the primacy of ethics and maintained that no knowledge was possible without reference to ethical considerations (e.g., Bernasconi and Critchley 1989; Cohen 1986; Levinas 1984). This strong and close relationship between knowledge and ethics makes it imperative to investigate judiciously their boundaries so that their interrelationships can be understood better. Indeed, without this specific understanding, many dangerous confusions and epistemological errors can be committed. For example, this is particularly evident when attempts are made</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>to understand and deal with the effects of political violence from exclusively psychological and psychopathological perspectives [without considering] intrapsychic, interpersonal and external dimensions . . . [and without appreciating] the wider political, historical, social, economic, ethical, spiritual and moral perspectives.</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 2005: 46)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Then, often we tend to become ‘prone to get confused and commit methodological and epistemological errors, ending up psychologising the political realm and pathologising human suffering’ (Papadopoulos 2005: 46).</p>
                <p>Returning to the developing of a working meaning of epistemology, the majority of definitions in non-specialist dictionaries refer to epistemology as ‘the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods and validity’ (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oxford English Dictionary</em>). Other, more technical texts define epistemology as ‘the philosophical inquiry into the nature, conditions, and extent of human knowledge’ (Sosa and Kim 2000b: ix). Essentially, epistemology is the study of how we know that we know, of what constitutes a valid understanding/explanation/knowledge. A more general definition that would offer a working framework for this chapter would be that epistemology is the systematic investigation of what makes us accept (think/feel) that we know something, of what makes us mark a certain territory as observed and comprehended. This means that epistemology addresses not only the conditions that make the knower know but also the interaction between the knower and the known, as well as the circumstances within which this interrelationship takes place.</p>
                <p>Continuing with the etymological approach to definition, methodology is the logos of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">methodos</em>. The Greek word <em class="notranslate" translate="no">methodos</em> is a composite of meta and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">odos</em>. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Meta</em> means after (implying development), and odos is the road, the route. Therefore, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">methodos</em> literally means ‘a following after’ (Liddell and Scott 1869), following a road, adhering to a set way. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oxford English Dictionary</em> (OED) defines method as ‘a particular procedure for accomplishing or approaching something’, and also ‘orderliness of thought or behaviour’; hence, methodology (according to OED) is ‘a system of methods used in a particular field’. This means that methodology refers to the application of the epistemological premises that a person holds at a given time.</p>
                <p>In this chapter, methodology will be used to refer to the specific ways that Jung used to apply his epistemology, i.e., the ways he followed which were guided (consciously or unconsciously) by his particular epistemology (cf. also Dieckmann 1991; Penna 2004). In other words, whereas epistemology would be related to his assumptions about sources of knowledge and evidence, methodology would be related to the manner in which Jung applied these insights in the ways he developed his theory and practice.</p>

                    <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung’s epistemological sensitivity</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Before investigating Jung’s specific epistemological positions and development, it will be appropriate to first establish and emphasise the fact that he had a particularly acute epistemological sensitivity.</p>
                <p>An excellent example of this sensitivity and resulting methodology is offered in Jung’s essay on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses</em> (Jung 1932a). The full title of the essay is ‘Ulysses’: a monologue’ and it is, indeed, Jung’s own monologue, recording his own reactions to James Joyce’s novel. Jung first writes about his views on the novel and gradually becomes irritated by it. Then, all of a sudden he turns his attention to his own irritation and writes: ‘Joyce has aroused my ill will. One should never rub the reader’s nose into his own stupidity, but this is just what <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses</em> does’ (Jung 1932a: par. 167). Jung, at this point, stops writing about his subject matter and instead begins to observe himself and his own very reaction;1 he continues: ‘A therapist like myself is always practising therapy—even on himself. Irritation means: You haven’t yet seen what’s behind it. Consequently we should follow up our irritation and examine whatever it is we discover in our ill temper’ (Jung 1932a: par. 168).</p>
                <p>Although the analyst reader of Jung’s essay will accept this incident as an ordinary example of Jung’s awareness of his own countertransference to Joyce’s novel, in effect, this is also a clear illustration of Jung’s epistemological awareness in so far as Jung attempts to trace back the source of his own assumptions, knowledge and feelings. In fact, the process of countertransference is nothing but an example of an epistemological procedure in action, during psychotherapy. When the analyst tries to catch himself or herself and observes where certain feelings, thoughts or even words said to the analysand come from, to all intents and purposes, the analyst is performing an epistemological tracking (in addition, of course, to attending to a whole lot of other parameters). The attempt to trace back the origin and context of one’s own assumptions is the essence of the epistemological procedure and this is what countertransference is about.</p>
                <p>In this context, it is worth noting that although it was Freud who first ‘discovered’ the phenomenon of countertransference (Freud 1910), it was Jung who emphasised its positive contribution to the therapeutic process (e.g., Jung 1916/1948). Freud, for most of his life, considered countertransference as an obnoxious interference of the analyst’s pure position as observer of the analysand. On the contrary, Jung appreciated that countertransference is an essential tool through which analysts can trace the source of their own thoughts, feelings and even actions (verbal and otherwise) in relation to their analysands, and it is for these reasons that he recommended that ‘the sine qua non is the analysis of the analyst, what is called the training analysis’ (Jung: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memories</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dreams</em>, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reflections</em> (MDR), p. 154). Jung proposed the institution of personal analysis (training analysis) for analysts-intraining not so that they become perfect and pure but in order to learn how to learn from their own reactions during the course of their analytical work; in other words, Jung wanted future analysts to know how to know what makes them know.</p>
                <p>This example testifies to Jung’s epistemological awareness. Moreover, it also shows how Jung put into practice this awareness, i.e., it illustrates his resulting methodology.</p>
                <p>In the ‘Ulysses’ essay, Jung follows up his epistemological awareness with a systematic investigation of the sources of his ‘knowledge’. Not only does he catch himself being irritated but also he tries to find out what is the meaning of this irritation. ‘Irritation means: You haven’t yet seen what’s behind it. Consequently we should follow up our irritation and examine whatever it is we discover in our ill temper’ (Jung 1932a: par. 168). Once he becomes conscious of the presence of a certain way of reacting (i.e., irritation) he begins to observe himself, by ‘practicing therapy even on himself ‘. In this way, therapy becomes almost synonymous with the very epistemological tracking of one’s sources of knowledge.</p>
                <p>Another example of Jung’s epistemological vigilance is to be found in his views about the uses and abuses of case histories. With incisive perceptiveness, he warned that</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The empirical intellect, occupying itself with the minutiae of casehistories, involuntarily imports its own philosophical premises not only into the arrangement but also into the judgement of the material and even into the apparently objective presentation of data.</p>
                    <p>(Jung 1935a: par. 548)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This quotation is very important because it demonstrates the degree of Jung’s awareness of the complexities of how the knower knows. Philosophy here is not an abstraction or a school of thought one chooses consciously to adhere to. By ‘philosophical premises’, Jung here refers to the cognitive process that inevitably orders and structures our perception according to various ways that create ‘involuntarily’ certain premises, assumptions that colour our understanding and make us accept that we have a certain knowledge about something—a patient, in this example. Jung stresses that this structuring process happens at least at three levels—at the very ‘presentation’ of the (case-) material, at the ‘arrangement’ and at the ‘judgement’ of it. Whereas it is evident that our judgements are influenced by certain ‘premises’ of ours, it is not easily acceptable that there is a certain degree of ‘involuntary’ interference by some ‘philosophical premises’ even in the ‘apparently objective presentation of data’. Usually, people believe that a ‘fact’ is a ‘fact’ and when a therapist presents the ‘facts’ of the case, it is usually believed that no epistemological colouring (of a substantial degree) is involved in influencing the presentation. The whole tradition of case-history is based on this ‘objectivity’. It is remarkable that Jung, at that time, was concerned about the ‘objectivity’ of such innocuous presentations. This awareness leads Jung to generalise this epistemological process: ‘What is the use of even the most accurate and punctilious work if it is prejudiced by an unavowed assumption? Any science worthy of the name must criticize its own assumptions’ (Jung 1935a: par. 548). This statement shows that Jung extends his epistemological awareness, as it applies to the analytical situation, to address scientific method in general, thus anticipating current epistemological approaches (cf. Bateson 1979; de Shaser 1982; Keeney 1983; Neil and Kniskern 1982; Selvini-Palazzoli et al. 1978; Watzlawick et al. 1974).</p>
                <p>These two examples show Jung’s sharp sensitivity to the importance of epistemological considerations, not only in psychotherapy but also in the wider scientific enquiry. Without using the word ‘epistemology’, Jung demonstrates his epistemological acumen. This can be epitomised by his statement, in 1947, that ‘all knowledge is the result of imposing some kind of order upon the reactions of the psychic system as they flow into our consciousness’ (Jung 1947: par. 362). Throughout his life and work, Jung displayed a remarkable awareness of these epistemological processes.</p>

                </header>
                <p>In a letter to Freud, very early in their professional relationship (on 29 December 1906), Jung felt the need to delineate their differences and identified five points on which ‘we do not see eye to eye’ (McGuire 1974: 14). The first was about the different clinical ‘material’ Jung was working with (‘I am working . . . with uneducated insane patients . . . with Dementia praecox’, as opposed to Freud’s educated elite of Vienna which Jung did not mention in the letter, but it is implicit); the third was about their differences in experience (Jung was nineteen years younger than Freud), and the fourth was about the ‘psychoanalytic talent’ that Jung felt that Freud had more ‘both in quantity and quality’. As fifth, Jung cited the ‘defect’ of having not received direct training from Freud and for the lack of contact with his older master. But it is the second one that needs our attention. Jung put it simply, epigrammatically and strongly: ‘my upbringing, my milieu, and my scientific premises are in any case utterly different from your own’ (McGuire 1974: 14).</p>
                <p>Jung did not elaborate on any of the issues he stated in his second point (either in the same letter or subsequently in other letters) and Freud, responding on the New Years day (1 January 1907), did not address at all the differences that Jung identified but, instead, implored him, ‘I beg of you, . . . don’t deviate too far from me when you are really so close to me’ (McGuire 1974: 18). In other words, Freud was not prepared to consider their differences, especially at a time when he was too keen to strengthen their closeness both at a professional and at a personal level. Above all, that was a critical time and both were needed to work together to establish and legitimise psychoanalysis. As a result, these differences, so clearly outlined by Jung, were not followed up either by him or Freud again.</p>
                <p>What did Jung mean by these differences? Why was he so definitive, writing that he was ‘utterly different’, not just ‘different’? Ultimately, what does he mean by ‘scientific premises’, here?</p>
                <p>In order to address these questions, it is important to be reminded of Jung’s life and work until that point. In terms of employment, he was still working at the Burghozli hospital in Zurich and in terms of writing, the major works he had completed were his doctoral dissertation and his earlier Zofingia lectures; by that time, he had also completed most of his writing on traditional psychiatric issues and had published his first psychoanalytic paper (in support of Freud’s theory of hysteria). At the BurghoÈ lzli hospital, in addition to his psychiatric work, Jung was conducting pioneering research in schizophrenia using mainly the Word Association Test. In so far as he emphasised his differences from Freud (before they even met), Jung showed how strongly he felt about his own identity, not only as a professional but also in terms of his established position with reference to scientific investigation. What was this position and in what way was it related to his epistemological sensitivity?</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Zofingia lectures</em></p>
                <p>While he was still a student, Jung gave five lectures (1896-1899) at the Zofingia student society of which he was a member. In these lectures, he addressed issues such as the nature of science, psychology, religion and the nature of scientific enquiry, all from a thoughtful and philosophical perspective. These lectures show the depth of his understanding of epistemological and methodological issues and provide the researcher with a unique opportunity to trace Jung’s early philosophical and scientific premises. The positions he developed here were remarkably similar to the ones he held as a mature thinker in his later life, so much so that some authors went as far as claiming that Jung’s ‘philosophical attitude’ revealed in these lectures remained unaltered till the end of his life (Nagy 1991: 12). Such a claim would be rather far fetched because it ignores some important differentiations Jung made during the course of developing his thought; nevertheless, it would be fairly accurate to accept that, with regard to his overall philosophical position, these lectures laid the foundation of most of his subsequent work. Here are some of the basic premises (relevant to this chapter) that he developed in these lectures.</p>
                <p>First, in tracing the ‘Border Zones of Exact Science’, Jung rejects the positions of both ‘contemporary sceptical materialist opinion’ (1896-1899: par. 63) and metaphysics arguing for the need of a third position in between. At that time he found vitalism to be that third possibility. According to vitalism, life is a vital principle which is distinct from the material realm of physics and chemistry, although connected with it. Throughout, Jung retained this tendency to reject both the mechanistic approach to science as well as the blindly religious approach and always strove to develop a third principle. His early espousal of vitalism was to be replaced successively by other formulas which were never that dissimilar to this initial formulation; however, all of them included a stance which was introduced in these lectures for the first time—a strong emphasis on the primacy of the psychological as an independent realm, not as a product either of mechanistic materialism or of abstract metaphysics.</p>
                <p>The physical phenomena have been studied and threshed out down to the last detail. Metaphysical phenomena are virtually a closed book. Surely it would be valuable to inquire into properties other than those with which we have long been familiar.</p>
                <p>(Jung 1896-1899: par. 65)</p>
                <p>Second, related to the above, was Jung’s emphasis on the personal experience as opposed to ‘inductive scientific method’ (par. 175).</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The only true basis for philosophy is what we experience ourselves and, through ourselves, of our world around us. Every a priori structure that converts our experience into an abstraction must inevitably lead us to erroneous conclusions [and again] Our philosophy should consist in drawing inferences about the unknown . . . on the basis of real experience, and not in drawing inferences about the inner world on the basis of the outer, or denying external reality by affirming only the inner world.</p>
                    <p>(par. 175)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>These quotations demonstrate Jung’s sharp epistemological clarity in rejecting either psychologising the world or imposing meaning from exclusively external parameters. This fine delineation was another characteristic in his subsequent epistemology.</p>
                <p>Third, it is in the context of the second argument that Jung insisted in emphasising his ‘empirical’ approach, which was another hallmark of his later methodology. ‘All philosophy must have an empirical foundation’ (par. 175). His avowal for both the empirical nature of his enquiry as well as the primacy of the psychological created much perplexity. Yet, for Jung these positions were not contradictory. ‘The primary concern of empirical psychology is to supply factual documentation supporting the theories of rational psychology’ (par. 114).</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The new empirical psychology furnishes us with data ideally designed to expand our knowledge of organic life and to deepen our views of the world . . . Our body formed of matter, our soul gazing toward the heights, are joined into a single living organism . . . Man lives at the boundary between two worlds.</p>
                    <p>(par. 142)quote</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In later years, this dual emphasis of seemingly opposing methods was to take the form of seeing himself both as an ‘empiricist’ as well as a ‘phenomenologist’ (cf. Brooke 1991).</p>
                <p>Fourth, another epistemological concept that Jung first introduced in the Zofingia lectures was teleology. This is one of Jung’s most important methodological approaches and during these lectures (paradoxically) he connected it with causality. Jung understood this connection as follows: he believed that humans are driven to enquire after the cause of things, so much so that he even spoke about a ‘causal instinct’. Inevitably, this instinct ‘leads us, a priori, away from all externality to the inwardness of transcendent causes’ (par. 224); this is so because ‘the chain of cause and effect is infinite’ (par. 197) and once one keeps on enquiring after the cause of things one will eventually begin to look for patterns beyond the visible and external. But this kind of enquiry, in effect, is about not just the origin of things but also about their order, their purpose and ultimately their meaning (von Franz 1983: xx). ‘The gratification of the need for causal thinking is truth’ (par. 171). Behind causality there was an objective purpose:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Radical subjectivists, i.e., those who regard the world as illusion, and multiplicity as a show of glittering nothingness, deny any objective purpose. That is, they do not acknowledge the existence of any teleology external to man, and instead claim that we ourselves have projected onto the world, out of our own heads, the idea of the purposefulness of nature.</p>
                    <p>(par. 175)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This means that Jung, even at this beginning stage of his scientific career, held the centrality of teleology not only in relation to human motivation and enquiry but also as a general principle in nature, at large.</p>
                <p>The final point that needs to be identified from the Zofingia lectures is Jung’s privileging of morality. Following Kant’s primacy of morality, Jung criticised science and materialism for ‘poisoning morality’ (par. 137) and declared that ‘no truth obtained by unethical means has the moral right to exist’ (par. 138). Jung’s strong feelings are reflected in the emphatic language he used in order to press his point; he went as far as advocating ‘a ‘revolution from above’ by forcing morality on science . . . for after all scientists have not hesitated to impose their scepticism and moral rootlessness on the world’ (par. 138). The strong moral foundation of epistemology that Jung established in these lectures was to remain with him till the end of his life. Throughout, he was passionate that no production of knowledge should be placed above ethical considerations. This relates to the earlier discussion of the ethical dimensions of epistemology.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Doctoral dissertation</em></p>
                <p>As it is known, for this dissertation, Jung wrote an account and analysis of his observations of a 15-year-old girl (whom he gave the false initials S.W.) who, as a medium, held spiritualistic seances. In fact, this girl was Helene (‘Helly’) Preiswerk, who was a relative of Jung’s mother. Over a long period of time, Jung investigated, as a participant observer, not only the content of the seÂances but also Helene’s overall progress from an insecure little girl to a self-assertive mature woman. From an epistemological point of view, the main features of his doctoral dissertation were the following four.</p>
                <p>First, this was one of the first times that Jung, in a professional context, attempted to look for the meaning behind the external formulations of verbalisations—the focus of his enquiry (in his dissertation) was beyond the expressed language of the medium and on the meaning this language had for her, in her own specific circumstances and context. He did not accept her alleged communications with spirits at face value, but tried to seek the meaning they had for Helene in the context of her own development. For example, he noted that she communicated with certain spirits that were frivolous and superficial and Jung understood this as Helene’s need to get in touch with her own childish part which did not have much opportunity to be actualised. Later, he noted that Helene’s main ‘guide spirit’ became another one who was a serious, mature and devout person; Jung understood this as Helene’s need to connect with the ideal personality in her which was in the making. All this shows how Jung was keen not to get trapped in the expressed language of the phenomena but to seek the meaning that language had for the person.</p>
                <p>Second, and closely connected with the above, is Jung’s expressed primacy of the psychological. To put it simply, Jung was not interested in whether the spirits existed or not but he was interested in the psychological meaning and implications of the fact that Helene herself believed that she was communicating with spirits. This approach was going to become a characteristic of Jung’s epistemology. Throughout, he emphasised his right to examine the psychological meaning of the phenomena he was investigating, regardless of the nature of the phenomena, always believing that he was not violating the phenomena themselves. By clearly delineating the psychological angle and meaning of these phenomena, Jung gave himself the licence to move into any field and examine their psychological implications; later in his career he was going to follow the same epistemological approach to investigate phenomena that could come under various other headings, e.g., ‘insanity’, ‘religion’, ‘politics’, ‘art’, etc. Here, in his doctoral dissertation, Jung respecting the nature of the phenomena he was investigating (i.e., spiritualistic), all he was interested in was the psychological impact they had on Helene.</p>
                <p>Third, perhaps Jung’s most important theoretical innovation, which was also of great epistemological value, was his understanding that Helene’s communications with ‘spirits’ had a teleological function (Haule 1984; Papadopoulos 1980). During her mediumistic career, Helene was contacting different ‘spirits’ and one of the most important ‘spirits’ she connected with was that of a person she called ‘Ivenes’. It was about Ivenes that Jung said that she was a ‘serious’ and ‘mature person’. Jung observed that by connecting with Ivenes, Helene ‘anticipates her own future and embodies in Ivenes what she wishes to be in twenty years’ time - the assured, wise, gracious, pious lady’ (Jung 1902: par. 116). This means that Ivenes was for Helene what Papadopoulos (1980, 1984) called an ‘Anticipated Whole Other’, in other words, an other personality in her which anticipated her own wholeness. The important point here is that Jung did not see and understand psychological phenomena in terms of their pathological meaning only, he also appreciated that psychological functioning (including even pathological symptoms) have a certain teleological function, they point to the purpose and goal of one’s development. Teleology was to remain one of Jung’s most characteristic elements of his epistemological approach.</p>
                <p>Finally, in his research for his doctoral dissertation Jung introduced his specific method of participant observation which was to become his characteristic approach to methodology. In the same way that Jung sat in the spiritualistic seances of Helene’s both as a participant as well as an observer, so did he continue with the same method in his psychotherapeutic practice as well as in other scientific investigations. This means that he always valued that knowledge was produced by experience and in the context of interaction with others—what modern systemic epistemologists would call ‘coconstruction’ of knowledge (e.g., Coulter 1995; Fulford et al. 2003; Gergen and Davis 1985; Gergen and Gergen 2003; Glaser and Strauss 1967; Hermans and Hermans-Jansen 1995; Sarbin 1986; Young 1997).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Burghozli</em></p>
                <p>During Jung’s period of work at the BurghoÈ lzli psychiatric hospital (between 1900 and 1909), this famous institution was the centre of pioneering research. Under the directorship of Professor Eugen Bleuler, the originator of the term ‘schizophrenia’, a talented team of international clinicians and researchers studied psychotic conditions both from academic research as well as clinical perspectives. First, we will examine the key epistemological features of Jung’s psychiatric-therapeutic work of this period and then of his research work.</p>
                <p>Continuing on from his doctoral dissertation, one of Jung’s main concerns became the search for the meaning of his patients’ verbalisations. Again, he did not accept that what his patients said was meaningless because they came from insane people; he did not want to dismiss what they said as just insane talk. Instead, Jung endeavoured to seek the uniqueness of their meaning. Even with chronic patients who were ‘completely demented and given to saying the craziest things which made no sense at all’ (MDR, p. 147), Jung found meaning in what they were saying, ‘which had hitherto been regarded as meaningless’ (MDR, p. 147). For example, one patient used to wail ‘I am Socrates’ deputy’ and Jung found out (by investigating closely her personality and circumstances) that she ‘was intended to mean: ‘I am unjustly accused like Socrates’ (MDR, p. 147). Sometimes, by working actively towards developing an understanding of their language Jung was able to produce remarkably positive changes, even ‘curing’ them, like with the schizophrenic old woman that was hearing a voice whom she called ‘God’s voice’ and Jung told her that ‘We must rely on that voice’ (MDR, p. 148). By relating to her in a way that was offering not only validation but also bestowing a certain meaning to the meaninglessness of her ‘insane’ voices, Jung was able to achieve an ‘unexpected success’ in her treatment (MDR, p. 148).</p>
                <p>It is important to acknowledge that the emphasis on meaning was not an invention of Jung’s, but it was part of the overall ethos and approach developed by Bleuler. Characteristically, A.A. Brill (the American psychoanalyst who was also part of that research group at the Burghozli) wrote that the psychiatrists at that institution at the time ‘were not interested in what the patients said, but in what they meant’ (Brill 1946: 12). This does not invalidate Jung’s contribution but it provides its context; he was able to connect this philosophy to his own approach and, most importantly, to develop it further and reach his unique epistemological positions.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Word association experiment</em></p>
                <p>Many important innovations were introduced at the BurghoÈ lzli by the work with and applications of the word association experiment; although the concept of ‘complex’ is considered to be the most important one, nevertheless, there are some significant epistemological elements that also emerged from this work and which contributed to the formation of Jung’s definition of a knowing person.</p>
                <p>To begin with, the actual Word Association Test (WAT) was based on the psychological school of ‘Associationism’ which, it could said, was a theory of knowledge, i.e., an epistemology. More specifically, the essence of Associationism was that our mental activity is based on associations; i.e., our knowledge and awareness of things is a product of various combinations of associations which we have of elements derived from sense experiences. Philosophers throughout the ages developed and updated different theories and laws of association—from Plato and Aristotle to more modern thinkers and psychologists. In psychology, associationism entered via Harvey (1705-1757), Galton (1822-1911) and Wundt (1832- 1920). Although Galton and Wundt examined word association as part of their investigations into the field of cognitive functioning, it was Kraepelin (1856-1926), an earlier superintendent at the Burghozli hospital, who developed the actual WAT and Jung eventually was appointed (by Bleuler) in charge of the programme using this research tool. The Burghozli preoccupation with the WAT was not theoretical but applied to abnormal psychology; they were interested in understanding the mechanisms involved in the ‘schizophrenic’ mind. Bleuler’s main contribution in renaming ‘dementia praecox’ by introducing a new term (‘schizophrenia’) meant that this condition does not create a ‘premature deterioration’ but it involves an actual split within the patient’s personality and functioning. The WAT was used, in effect, to study the way the schizophrenic patients developed their perception and knowledge in order to trace the way the ‘split personality’ functions. Their responses to the stimulus words were analysed according to various categories (semantic, phonetic, syntactical and grammatical) and, experimentally, it was possible to identify that inner split. This was found in terms of discerning various themes that formed coherent wholes in the body of their responses. More specifically, Jung found in the responses that certain clusters of ideas and thoughts with a degree of emotional charge formed distinct entities which he termed ‘complexes’. Jung did not invent this term but he gave it this specific research definition: ‘An emotionally charged complex of ideas becomes so predominant in an individual and has such a profound influence that it forms a large number of constellations . . . all referring to this complex of ideas’ (Jung and Riklin 1904: 82). But such a nucleus, a centre in oneself that generated an independent perception and knowledge of things, in effect, represented another ‘mind’ within an individual. As Jung put it later,</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>We are, therefore, justified in regarding the complex as somewhat a small secondary mind, which deliberately (though unknown to consciousness) drives at certain intentions which are contrary to the conscious intentions of the individual.</p>
                    <p>(Jung 1911: par. 1352)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Therefore, from an epistemological perspective, Jung’s theory of complexes enabled him to appreciate that the knowing subject is not a unified entity but it is divided by the various complexes that grip the person. Thus, the complexes created a divided knowing subject according to the various thematical divisions that the complexes formed. This means that by grasping the essential nature of psyche’s dissociability (Papadopoulos 1980), Jung was able to increase substantially the complexity of his epistemological grasp of human nature.</p>
                <p>‘<em class="notranslate" translate="no">my scientific premises</em> . . .’</p>
                <p>It is now possible to return to the questions asked above, in connection with Jung’s identification of his differences from Freud. To be reminded, in his letter to his older colleague at the end of 1906, Jung identified three differences: their ‘upbringing’, ‘milieu’ and ‘scientific premises’. By ‘scientific premises’, in the context of their respective work, Jung must have meant the specific ways each one of them defined their subject matter and went about investigating it, i.e., their epistemology and methodology. More specifically, by ‘scientific premises’ Jung must have referred to the way they answered questions such as: what constituted evidence for their investigations? How did they know that they had arrived at knowing something? How did they construe their knowing subjects?</p>
                <p>Initially, the reader would be puzzled to read that Jung even before he had developed a close relationship and collaboration with Freud (by the end of 1906), he wrote about his ‘scientific premises’ in a way that conveyed a certain conviction that he had already formed such ‘scientific premises’ and, moreover, stating that they were different from those of Freud’s. However, the same reader would not be puzzled anymore after reading the outline of Jung’s achievements and established epistemological and methodological positions which he had already reached by the end of 1906. Although the correspondence between the two men started only that year (1906) and they did not meet in person until a couple of months later (February 1907), Jung’s letter (of December 1906) conveys with clarity his firm belief that their ‘scientific premises’ were different. In short, Jung’s assertion about their differences suggests the following:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>1 Jung was aware of the relevance of epistemological and methodological principles (i.e., ‘scientific premises’) in analytical theory and practice.</p>
                    <p>2 This awareness was developed well before he met with Freud and, therefore, it was not connected directly with Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
                    <p>3 The usual version of their professional relationship, which both Jung and Freud originated and perpetuated, i.e., that Jung started as a mere disciple of Freud’s is not accurate as it is not supported by the evidence that these observations in this chapter provide. This means that their version of events must have been developed for other, possibly psychological reasons, related to the dynamics of their personal relationship.</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 1980, 1984)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Therefore, in the light of this analysis of these observations, it would be difficult to accept the accuracy of Jung’s dramatic assessment which he wrote in his autobiography, referring to his break with Freud:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>When I parted from Freud, I knew that I was plunging into the unknown. Beyond Freud, after all, I knew nothing; but I had taken the step into darkness.</p>
                    <p>(MDR, p. 225)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>These strong words ‘unknown’, ‘nothing’ and ‘darkness’ do not correspond with the evidence that Jung, even before meeting Freud, had established clear epistemological positions, and, moreover, they contradict his own position that was conveyed succinctly in his letter of December 1906. Thus, these words can be puzzling, especially if we take into consideration that his subsequent work (after 1906) did not produce substantial deviations from these epistemological positions; in the following years, Jung introduced, indeed, many important theoretical developments, but in terms of his basic epistemology and methodology, he did not deviate much from the foundations that he had laid by 1906. Why, then, did Jung keep to this false version of events, still writing about them in such a categorical tone nearly half a century later? Why did he keep on perpetuating this myth? In addition to the psychological reasons (which can be extremely powerful and with long-lasting effects), it is possible that Jung retained this conviction because it was based on some partial truth, or at least on something paradoxical.</p>
                <p>One way of understanding this puzzle is to accept that Jung’s strong words about his (alleged) total ignorance after his break with Freud may refer to another perspective from which Jung saw his own work: it was argued elsewhere (Papadopoulos 1980, 1984) that during the period of his association with Freud (Jung’s ‘psychoanalytic period’) and after his break with Freud (in 1913) there was a disjuncture between Jung’s epistemology and his own actual theories; it was only later that Jung was able to develop theories which fitted more appropriately to his already established epistemology. This means that Jung’s epistemology preceded his theories. More specifically, during his association with Freud, by and large, Jung went overboard to accept and adopt the Freudian version of psychoanalysis as his own, despite the fact that he did not feel satisfied with it; the fit between his epistemology and the Freudian psychoanalysis was not a good one. Jung felt uncomfortable about this and eventually parted ways from Freud and gradually developed his own language that corresponded better with his already set ‘inclinations’ and epistemological positions.</p>
                <p>Therefore, this version of accounting for the discrepancy between Jung’s letter of December 1906 and his categorical assessment (in his autobiography) about the ‘darkness’ he had stepped into after he left Freud, is based on a distinction between Jung’s epistemology (which was the sum of his ‘scientific assumptions’, which formed the foundations of his approach, and which were, in fact, his ‘natural’ ‘inclination’ as to how he approached his work both theoretically and practically) and his ‘official’ theoretical positions (which referred to the theories that he espoused and identified professionally with). Once such a distinction is made, it is then possible to understand the contradiction between his letter of 1906 (claiming that he had clear positions, and they were different from those of Freud’s) and his writing in his autobiography (that after Freud he knew nothing). In other words, Jung was not not telling a truth in his autobiography—he was referring to his explicit theoretical formulations which could identify his professional positions, whereas in his 1906 letter he was referring to his epistemology.</p>
                <p>A comparable distinction between Jung’s ‘official theoretical language’ and his own personal ‘inclination’ was made elsewhere (Papadopoulos 1980, 1984, 2002), where Jung’s ‘inclination’ was articulated in more detail. More specifically, in those studies, Jung’s official language was understood to be the result of his professional ‘persona’, which he felt it was important for him to maintain; in addition (and in contrast), Jung had another perspective on his work which was his epistemological inclination and which was informed by another problematic that was driving his theoretical and professional development. That perspective (his epistemology) was identified as his ‘problematic of the other’ which referred to his intense interest in the dissociability of the psyche, i.e., in the way various forms of ‘othernesses’ were active in one’s personality and the ways these ‘others’ interrelated among themselves and also related to the main body of the personality, to the outside world and to wider collective structures (Papadopoulos 1980, 1984, 2002). In effect, the first two studies (Papadopoulos 1980, 1984)</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>proposed a new reading of Jung which was based on the hypothesis that the Jungian opus could be appreciated more fully if it were to be seen as a series of progressive reformulations of his understanding of the Other.</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 2002: 170)</p>

                <p>It was argued that Jung’s theoretical development was based on these progressive reformulations of the Other</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>from animistic external Other objects [of his childhood, e.g., his ‘own’ fire, his ‘own’ stone, his ‘own’ pebble and carved manikin] to a rather unsophisticated, global internal Other (No. 2 personality), and then from intrapsychic individual functions (complexes) to more collective forms of structuring principles (symbols). The Other-as-archetype represents the pinnacle of Jung’s theoretical endeavours as it offers a structuring principle which is also connected with broader cultural and societal perspectives. This reformulation represented a dialectic between the internal and external, specific/individual and general/collective, personal/intrapsychic and societal/symbolic.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Not only did that approach offer a new ‘reading’ of Jung which combined almost seamlessly his personal life and preoccupations along with his professional curiosity and career in the context of wider intellectual debates at his time, but also it laid the foundations for an understanding of Jung based on his epistemological astuteness. In other words, the best possible way of understanding the nature of his ‘problematic of the other’ is in terms of it forming a basis for comprehending the dynamics of the knowing subject, i.e., in terms of epistemology. By endeavouring to dissect the various structures and discourses that inform a person to reach a knowing position, Jung was, in fact, developing an epistemological stance. This means that when Jung was referring to his ‘scientific premises’ he was referring to his epistemological ‘inclination’ and his ‘problematic of the other’ both of which were developed to a considerable degree before even he had met Freud, and before he was exposed to Freud’s psychoanalytic theories. Moreover, it was argued that Jung’s initial attraction to Freud was based on his assumption that Freud shared the same problematic with him, i.e., had similar epistemological premises. Epistemologically speaking, that was the reason why Jung joined the psychoanalytic movement, hoping to find a more appropriate theoretical language for his own epistemological inclinations. However, when he realised that this was not happening, he left Freud and endeavoured to develop his own psychology which would be more congruent with his already well-developed epistemology.</p>
                <p>This reading of Jung’s differentiation between his epistemology (which was more basic) and his theoretical formulations (which developed later in his life) offers the means to understand the phrase ‘Jung before Freud’ which was introduced later (cf. Taylor 1998; Shamdasani 2003).</p>
                <p>Although this distinction (between his epistemology and the main body of his theories) resolves the puzzle of the discrepancy between Jung’s letter of 1906 and his statements in his autobiography, it still leaves something unclear. Why was Jung not fully aware of this distinction? On the one hand, he had a remarkable clarity about the importance of his epistemology and on the other hand, he seemed to be ambivalent about it. This was perhaps due to his fear that if he was to emphasise too much the epistemological nature of his theories he could have been considered as a philosopher and thus dismissed for not being a serious ‘scientist’—psychologist which he wanted to be seen as, in order to gain respectability for his work. Another possibility is that Jung may have taken his epistemology for granted, almost as his ‘inclination’ and, therefore, as different from (and of lesser importance than) the main body of his theoretical work; according to this perspective, Jung did not consider his epistemology of great importance in its own right, as a free-standing contribution. Certainly, at that time, there was no explicit field of epistemology of psychotherapy to assist him in appreciating the significance of his positions.</p>
                <p>Finally, returning to the December 1906 letter, it is also important to appreciate that by grouping all the three differences together—’upbringing’, ‘milieu’ and ‘scientific premises’, Jung demonstrated that, even at that early time, he was aware that the ‘scientific premises’ are not unrelated to one’s own personal history (‘upbringing’) as well as to the wider, collective contexts (‘milieu’). This is another important insight that he retained throughout: one’s epistemology is not an abstract theoretical construct but is embedded in one’s individual and collective realities.</p>

                <p>Although Jung’s basic epistemological positions were established by 1906, nevertheless there are some additional insights that contributed to the development of the final epistemological model of his psychology. These include the following:</p>
                <p>the collective dimension of knowledge</p>
                <p>teleology: knowledge in the making</p>
                <p>an epistemology of archetypal teleology.</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The collective dimension of knowledge</em></p>
                <p>During his lecturing visit to the United States with Freud in September 1909, in one of his presentations at Clark University (in Worcester, Massachusetts), Jung returned to a piece of research he had conducted with his student Dr Emma Furst. He had already published a paper on the subject two years earlier (Jung 1907) and, again, he included material from the same study in his Tavistock Lectures more than a quarter of a century later (Jung 1935b). That study offers a clue to the development of Jung’s understanding of one of his most significant epistemological insights.</p>
                <p>The study, included in Jung’s Collected Works as ‘The family constellation’ (1909), addresses one application of the WAT. Jung and Furst administered the WAT to all members of twenty-four families. The two researchers analysed the obtained responses according to the existing ‘logical-linguistic criteria’ (Jung 1909: par. 1000) which Jung had developed from previous modifications (Jung and Riklin 1904). The findings showed that the differences between and among the response patterns of individual members of a family were not random but occurred in a regular and predictable fashion; they showed that statistically, there were remarkable similarities between the patterns of responses among certain subgroupings within families. More specifically, the results showed that children’s responses were more similar to their mothers’ rather than to their fathers’ associations, and that mothers’ associations were more similar to their daughters’ rather than to their sons’ associations.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The significance of these results is even greater if one appreciates that [this did not happen as a result of ] simple repetition of similar words by different members of the family, due to the given habits or family culture within each family.</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 1996: 131)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As Jung put it, ‘the daughter shares her mother’s way of thinking, not only in her ideas but also in her form of expression’ (1909: par. 1005); in fact, what is of more relevance is not the shared ‘form of expression’, which can be a product of learning, but the fact that certain members of the same family share the same ‘way of thinking’. This means that these research findings require a closer examination.</p>
                <p>The categories of ‘logical-linguistic criteria’ into which the responses were grouped included ‘relations of the verb to the subject’, ‘definition’, ‘contrast’, ‘simple predicate’, ‘predicate expressing a personal judgment’, etc. In other words, these criteria were not addressing superficial similarities; the results were showing how frequently each subject offered a response to the stimulus word that defined it, or was its contrast, etc. This means that the results were showing the pattern of each person’s tendency to perceive and structure external stimuli and how they construed logically and linguistically their perceptions. These are not ways that one can copy from another person; these are deeply ingrained mechanisms that convey one’s unique ways of cognitive structuring. In effect, this research indicated that within families there must be certain formations that are ‘organising structures which are collectively shared’ (Papadopoulos 1996: 130). These ‘shared unconscious structures’ affect the ways that family members structure their perceptions, knowledge, relationships and overall psychological realities. These formations ‘could be termed the Collective Structures of Meaning (CSM). This meaning, of course, is not given but is immanent and potential’ (Papadopoulos 1996: 136).</p>
                <p>Jung was at pains to interpret their research findings. In his 1909 paper, evidently puzzled by their findings, he</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>was unable to offer any plausible explanation for these phenomena. Instead, he struggled to fit them within the context of a psychoanalytic language and attributed them to the ‘determining influence’ of the ‘emotional environment constellated during infancy’ (Jung 1909: par. 1009).</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 1996: 131)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>On the basis of that research, Jung felt justified to acknowledge ‘the determining influence of the family background on [the children’s] destiny’ (1909: par. 1009), but at that time, confined within his psychoanalytic theoretical framework, he understood that ‘background’ only in terms of ‘the emotional environment constellated during infancy’ (Jung 1909: par. 1009). In other words, Jung was able to identify only those elements of these research findings which fitted within his existing psychoanalytic theory, but he must have felt at odds with the underlying ‘causal-reductive’ epistemology of this piece of psychoanalytic interpretation. As it has been shown, Jung had already a well-developed teleological epistemology.</p>
                <p>This means that the family WAT research must have exposed the implications of Jung’s distinction between his underlying epistemology and his ‘official’ theoretical positions; the latter were confined within the Freudian psychoanalytic model and, therefore, were unable to render fully intelligible these findings. More specifically, according to Freudian psychoanalysis, unconscious interactions between people had to be based on projections of one’s unconscious material onto another’s; there was no room for ‘shared’ unconscious structures, as this research suggested. Still, evidently unconvinced by the causal-reductive interpretation of his findings, at the end of the paper Jung admits the limitations of his theory (i.e., psychoanalytic theory) and writes: ‘We are as yet a long way from general precepts and rules’ and, most uncharacteristically, he resorts to extolling the virtues of psychoanalysis like a naive and fervent neophyte: ‘Only psychoanalyses like the one published by Professor Freud in our Jahrbuch, 1909, will help us out of this difficulty’ (Jung 1909: par. 1014).</p>
                <p>These findings are of tremendous importance because ‘By discovering the . . . patterns of logico-linguistic structuring within pairs in families, Jung, de facto, had discovered the intrapsychic interconnection within families as well as the various subgroupings or subsystems’ within families (Papadopoulos 1996: 131). From an epistemological point of view, Jung’s accidental discoveries in the family WAT research, in effect, indicate that the knowing subject is not just an independent being arriving at knowledge exclusively on the basis of his or her own independent experience. In addition, there are at least two more sources of potential knowledge: first, the interactional and relational patterns of experience; these include the family interactions and transactions as well as the network of inter-projections of unconscious material between members of the same family as well as with the wider sociocultural environment (including what Jung termed ‘emotional environment’), and second, the ‘shared unconscious structures’; these are structures that are not projected by one person onto another but, nevertheless, are affecting certain subgroups within families. These must be structures of a ‘collective’ nature that contribute to one’s creation of sense and the formation of knowledge.</p>
                <p>This paper (of 1909) shows how Jung almost accidentally stumbled across the phenomena of ‘shared unconscious structures’ which, subsequently, he was to name as ‘collective unconscious’. At that time, these phenomena exposed the limitations of his theory and the gap between his epistemology and his theories. Nevertheless, as it was noted, although</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Jung did not pursue this research, and did not work with families again [either clinically or in research] one could argue that the phenomena he encountered at this stage of his life never left him, instead, they [must have] set him a task to find more appropriate ways of comprehending them. His subsequent development followed that very direction and enabled him to formulate a perspective within which the intrapsychic and collective realms interrelate meaningfully.</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 1996: 131-132)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The implications of these findings are not limited only to Jung’s epistemology; by identifying unconscious shared structures within families, Jung could also be considered as a pioneer of modern family therapy (Garnett 1993; Papadopoulos 1996; Papadopoulos and Saayman 1989). <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Teleology: knowledge in the making</em></p>
                <p>Like most of the elements of his epistemological position, by no means, did Jung invent teleology, which has a long tradition in philosophy across cultures and time. Jung’s contribution was that he located teleology within a specific context along with the other elements of his epistemology and psychological theories.</p>
                <p>Teleology refers to the approach that considers phenomena in terms of their telos; telos, being the goal, end, purpose and fulfilment. As was mentioned above, Jung espoused a teleological approach as early as his Zofingia lectures. At that time, he discerned teleology not only as a method of enquiry but also as a process ‘external to man’ (Jung 1896-1899: par. 175), as a wider principle in life. Later, in his doctoral dissertation, Jung again employed a teleological approach to understand the spiritualistic phenomena he had observed. He felt that Helene’s spiritualistic experiences had a teleological function in that they assisted her psychological development and maturity.</p>
                <p>Jung distinguished between two basic methods in approaching psychological phenomena: a ‘constructive’ or ‘synthetic’ method and a ‘reductive’ (‘causal-reductive’) method. He identified with the former and he considered the latter to be the hallmark of the Freudian approach. Adopting Maeder’s understanding of the ‘prospective function of the unconscious’ (Maeder 1913) and Adler’s ‘anticipatory function of the unconscious’ (Adler 1912), Jung emphasised the ‘purposive significance’ of the unconscious: ‘We conceive the product of the unconscious . . . as an expression oriented to a goal or purpose’; accordingly, he understood that ‘the aim of the constructive method . . . is to elicit from the unconscious product a meaning that relates to the subject’s future attitude’ (Jung 1921: par. 701). In contrast, he considered that ‘The reductive method is oriented backwards . . . whether in the purely historical sense or in the figurative sense of tracing complex, differentiated factors back to something more general and more elementary’ (Jung 1921: par. 788). Moreover, he understood that</p>
                <p>Reduction has a disintegrative effect on the real significance of the unconscious product, since this is either traced back to its historical antecedents and thereby annihilated, or integrated once again with the same elementary process from which it arose.</p>
                <p>(Jung 1921: par. 788)quotw</p>
                <p>This means that in approaching psychological phenomena, one can either trace them back to their ‘origin’ into one’s own history (reductive method) or endeavour to relate to the purpose and meaning they have in terms of the person’s goals and future orientation (constructive method). The constructive method is based on teleology, or according to the Aristotelian terminology—the ‘final causality’. We can understand phenomena not only in terms of them being effects to previous causes (this would be the Aristotelian ‘efficient causality’) but also in terms of their purpose and ‘final cause’—their goal. Jung’s famous dicta—neurosis ‘must be understood, ultimately, as the suffering of a soul which has not discovered its meaning’ (Jung 1932b: par. 497) and ‘Neurosis is teleologically oriented’ (Jung 1943: par. 54) testify to his committed teleological orientation. But Jung did not limit his teleological understanding to his clinical work. He maintained that science at large was adopting teleological principles in approaching its subject matters. For example, he argued that ‘function’ as conceived by modern science is by no means exclusively a causal concept; it is especially a final or ‘teleological’ one’ (Jung 1917: par. 688). Also, he declared boldly that ‘Life is teleology par <em class="notranslate" translate="no">excellence</em>; it is a system of directed aims which seek to fulfil themselves. The end of every process is its goal’ (Jung 1934b: par. 798).</p>
                <p>Therefore, Jung’s use of teleology could be categorised into the following four types:</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">therapeutic teleology</em>—referring to his approach to psychological and psychopathological phenomena in the course of analytical therapeutic work; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">methodological teleology</em>—referring to the methodological use of teleology in scientific investigations, in general; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">human teleology</em>—referring to the purposeful direction human beings have towards psychological development; and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">natural teleology</em>—referring to his understanding that teleology is a law of life.</p>
                <p>All four types of teleological understanding have strong implications for Jung’s epistemological approach in so far as they suggest an impossibility of complete knowledge in a definitive way, as knowledge is related to a future purpose and goal. This means that, in effect, Jung’s epistemological teleology locates knowledge in the very process of generating itself. Thus, it could be said that the production of knowledge for Jung, especially in therapeutic contexts, involves the locating of oneself on the pathway along which teleology is unfolding as a lived experience. Instead of focusing on a final outcome and end product or state, Jung’s teleological epistemology favours an approach that accepts, what could be termed, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">knowledge in the making</em>. Accordingly, it is not surprising that Jung repeatedly emphasised the process of individuation instead of the final product of individuated state itself. By being connected along with and within the path of teleology one derives a certain meaning and sense which is real and substantial even if it is not definitive and ultimate in terms articulating itself in the format of a logical and rational explanation and definition. Aware of this finer differentiation, Jung used the term ‘finality’ in this context:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I use the word finality intentionally, in order to avoid confusion with the concept of teleology. By finality, I mean merely the immanent psychological striving for a goal. Instead of ‘striving for a goal’ one could also say ‘sense of purpose’. All psychological phenomena have some such sense of purpose inherent in them.</p>
                    <p>(Jung 1916/1948: par. 456)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Jung was evidently concerned that teleology could imply a crude expectation of a definitive goal with an accompanying rational formulation and, consequently, chose to introduce ‘finality’ in order to address this very idea of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">knowledge in the making</em>.</p>
                <p>Therefore, Jung developed further his original understanding of teleology and refined it in the context of his psychological epistemology, which continues to receive appropriate attention (e.g., Horne 2002; Jones 2002; Nagy 1991; Rychlak 1968, 1973, 1984).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">An epistemology of archetypal teleology</em></p>
                <p>Having established firmly the teleological intention as the basis of his approach, Jung needed to introduce more elements to support it and render it more applicable, at least to his therapeutic teleology. His initial understanding of the collective structure of knowledge formed a good beginning but it required further elaboration. It was not until the introduction of the archetype that Jung was able to furnish this elaboration.</p>
                <p>From an epistemological point of view, Jung’s theory of archetypes introduces a complexity that enriches his earlier formulations of teleology, by offering a bridge between the personal realm and the wider collective structures. More specifically, Jung suggests that ‘Archetypes . . . manifest themselves only through their ability to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">organize</em> images and ideas’ (Jung 1954: par. 440) and ‘consciousness . . . rests, as we know, on . . . the archetypes’ (Jung 1958: par. 656). Thus, epistemologically speaking, one would not be able to comprehend judiciously the sources of one’s knowledge unless one appreciated the organising effect that archetypes have on the knowing process, on one’s very consciousness.</p>
                <p>This means that, in addition to a reductive process of identifying the various contributing elements in a knowing process i.e., relating to personal history, interpersonal transactions and societal influences (as outlined above), the Jungian approach includes a constructive process that would take into account the archetypal organising influence. Diagrammatically, this could be represented by the dotted-lined arrows that affect not only the individuals (persons A and B in Figure 1.1) but also their interpersonal exchanges and unconscious mutual projections (IE and UP), as well as each person’s interaction with their own personal history (PHA and PHB), and the socio-cultural influences (S-CI).</p>
                <p>Figure 1.1 requires further clarification. Instead of having one single archetype organising the network of interactions, there is a cluster of archetypes (‘Network of Archetypal Images’) because archetypes are closely interrelated among themselves and it is seldom that only one, single archetype is activated without other archetypes also participating in the relational network with other individuals (Papadopoulos 1996). Moreover, even in the context of one individual, one archetype does not act on its own but it triggers off related archetypes (in a compensatory or supplementary way). This means that mostly, archetypes affect individuals and groups not in isolation but in clusters/networks/constellations.</p>
                <p>There are some additional facets of this process that Figure 1.1 depicts: first, archetypes (or archetypal constellations/networks) can affect not only individuals but also all the relationships and interactions individuals have; these include their interactions with their own personal history, with other individuals and groups, as well as the socio-cultural influences that are exerted on them. Second, it could be argued that although Jung did not emphasise it specifically, it follows from his theories that one’s own personal history would not have only a one-way, causal influence on the individual (as the causal-reductive method would dictate); instead, the relationship individuals have with their own past would be affected by the shifting positions and perspectives that the individuals take vis-aÁ-vis their own past. These changes can be the result of various factors, including, of course, the very organising influence of the archetypal constellations which, by their very nature, are not referring to the past but to the future, i.e., the archetypal effect is not retrogressive but prospective, with teleological finality (hence the dotted arrows on the figure are different from all the other arrows, denoting that the archetypal influence is of a different nature than the other kinds of interactions—it is an influence which moves constantly towards a finality). In effect, this means that a Jungian approach would imply (however paradoxical it may sound initially) that ‘it is not only the example, Jung characterised Freud’s understanding of neurosis as linear: one’s own childhood (A) causes the formation of one’s personality (B) which then causes the neurotic symptoms (C). The therapeutic direction that this model dictates would be the linear route in reverse: the therapist would need to go back to find the causes of the symptom (C) by unravelling the personality (B) which should be carried out by exploring the childhood conflicts (A). Jung accepted the value of causal-reductive epistemology but his argument was that this was not the only model available and certainly not the best one for understanding complex phenomena in the context of their purposive functions, especially when the archetypal involvement is also taken into consideration; for those contexts, Jung felt that it was more appropriate to employ a constructive method that would highlight the function of ‘finality’: ‘When a psychological fact has to be explained, it must be remembered that psychological data necessitate a twofold point of view, namely that of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">causality</em> and that of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">finality</em>’ (Jung 1916/1948: par. 456), and ‘To understand the psyche causally is to understand only one half of it’ (Jung 1914: par. 398).</p>
                <p>This means that Jung’s understanding of complex psychological phenomena is based essentially on what could be termed an ‘epistemology of finality’ which may also encompass a linear epistemology. This epistemology of finality would be comparable to what modern systemic family therapists call ‘circular’ or ‘systemic’ epistemology’ (cf. Becvar and Becvar 2002; Keeney 1983; Papadopoulos 1996, 1998). According to this epistemology, the three positions (A, B and C in Figure 1.2) are related not only in a linear, causal-reductive fashion but also in a way that one affects the other in a constant interaction (as in Figure 1.3), in a circular manner. After all, it should not be forgotten that the pattern of mutual influence is the essence of Jung’s alchemical model, where the circle (mandala) was the symbol <em class="notranslate" translate="no">par excellence</em> of wholeness. More concretely, the three positions (A, B and C) are in constant interaction among themselves in so far as the symptom has a further ‘final’, i.e., purposive function that affects the personality which then affects the way we approach our past.</p>
                <p>Another important implication of this new epistemology is that all three positions (A, B and C) do not exist in isolation but are also affected by the activation of archetypal constellations (again, as always with the archetypes, in a teleological rather than causal-reductive way). This means that the interaction among the three positions is patterned by the wider archetypal networks that affect it. The therapeutic approach in circular epistemologies is not based on the attempt to trace ‘the cause’ or ‘causes’ but to connect meaningfully with the contextual <em class="notranslate" translate="no">patterns</em> within which they are located. Jung referred to the ‘sense of purpose’ rather than clear explanation when he was addressing these relations and clarified that one cannot analyse, translate or interpret the archetype or its influence on the person (in a reductive way) but one has to relate and connect with it (in a constructive, purposive and teleological way):</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Hence the ‘explanation’ should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetype is assured.</p>
                    <p>(Jung 1940: par. 271)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This sentence is perhaps the best description that Jung offered to describe the relationship between the knowing subject/person and the archetype. First, he places ‘explanation’ in inverted commas, ensuring that the reader does not confuse this type of engagement (between the subject and the archetype) with the rational process of offering logical explanations. Referring to this unique kind of engagement, many authors have resorted to the traditional distinction between understanding (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Verstehen</em>) and explanation (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Erklaren</em>) in social sciences (cf. Jaspers 1923/1963; von Wright 1971), i.e., between comprehension/understanding, and logical/rational explanation, and opted for the former (e.g., Brooke 1991; Giannoni 2004; Hillman 1974; Rauhala 1984; Shelburne 1988). Then, in the same sentence, Jung refers to the ‘functional significance’ of the archetype which he wishes remains ‘unimpaired’. One should be reminded that Jung insisted on extending the meaning of ‘function’ beyond its usual causal connotation to include the teleological dimension (see above); also he uses the word ‘significance’ rather than meaning, evidently, in order to avoid any confusion with logical explanation and elaboration. Significance implies immanence, and not a type of objective knowledge. Thus, by ‘functional significance’ Jung here must be referring to the signification that would emerge from the archetype’s engagement and, indeed, relationship with the network of the interacting subject/s, as it is depicted in Figure 1.4.</p>
                <p>Although Jung, in the same sentence, addresses only the relationship between ‘the conscious mind and the archetype’, as it has been shown, none of these two are isolated and clearly delineated entities. In so far as both of them involve networks of relationships, the ‘functional significance’ here must be referring to the meaning that emerges from this engagement with all these interrelationships. Evidently, this meaning would not be a type of meaning that would be bestowed by means of external logical definition or explanation (cf. Mathers 2001).</p>
                <p>Finally, Jung clarifies that his preferred relationship between the archetype and the ‘conscious mind’ should be that of a ‘meaningful connection’. The primary characteristic Jung gives to the engagement between the knowing subject with the archetype is that of a ‘connection’, a relationship, an interaction, a ‘meaningful’ linkage that is not momentary but endures in time in order to deepen this association; once this ‘meaningful connection’ is established then a certain pathway is created, a new context is construed and an active process, a living experience begins which could lead gradually to the emergence of a new awareness, a sense of new purpose, thus, a new knowledge. But this knowledge would not be of the usual type of knowledge that a subject has of an object, but a sense of newness, of a shift in position by a person who becomes aware of his/her location within the network of interacting relationships as affected by the activation of the archetypal clusters within their purposive direction.</p>
                <p>By examining in detail this sentence by Jung on archetypes, it is now possible to appreciate that what he wants to clearly convey is that the unique engagement (between the knowing subject and the archetype) is not a set of clearly defined logical statements but a living experience that has a purpose and finality, beyond causal-reductive and linear epistemologies. The grip that the archetypal constellation would have on an individual creates a new context, a shift, a new unique pattern that shapes and, indeed, patterns one’s understanding of oneself, one’s relationships with others and one’s very sense of identity. This emerging <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pattern</em> also connects an individual with the wider socio-cultural ecology (which includes the ‘Collective Structures of Meaning’—Papadopoulos 1996) as well as with natural ecology in a prospective manner.</p>
                <p>Jung used frequently the term pattern in relation to archetypes when he was referring to them as connected to ‘patterns of behaviour’. Comparing the psychological realm with the biological, Jung used <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pattern</em> to refer to set combinations of behaviours that are triggered off when a certain instinct is activated. In a parallel way, he argued that the archetype acts in a similar way as it triggers off thoughts, ideas, images, feelings etc., i.e., a series of psychological (in parallel to the biological) elements of human functioning (e.g., Jung 1954: par. 398). The term pattern (be it in the biological or psychological realm) implies a network of interrelationships as opposed to linear causality. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oxford English Dictionary</em> defines pattern as ‘a regular or discernible form or order in which a series of things occur’, and it is this cluster of interactions that these diagrams depict.</p>
                <p>Such archetypal patterning creates a new context within which the individual acquires new perspectives and thinks and feels differently from before. In this way, it could be argued that with the introduction of archetypes, the Jungian epistemology could be considered as ‘epistemological contextualism’. Epistemological contextualism asserts that whatever we know is contingent on its context and therefore different contexts set different epistemic standards and conditions (e.g., Annis 1978; Cohen 1998; Sosa and Kim 2000a; Williams 2001).</p>
                <p>Thus, the further elaboration that Jung’s epistemology underwent by the introduction of his archetypal theory, consisted of all these new considerations that were outlined above and depicted in Figures 1.1 to 1.4. The archetypal patterning pushed Jung’s previous incomplete teleological inklings to new ways of formulating his old basic assumptions, articulating them into a new epistemology of archetypal finality which suggests that systemic patterns instead of isolated entities interact to create a new context within which new epistemic conditions arise.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Wider considerations</h3>
                <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pleroma and creatura, archetypes and systems</em></strong></p>
                <p>Gregory Bateson (1904-1980), the English anthropologist and social scientist (who is also one of the founders of systemic epistemology and family therapy) relied heavily on one part of the Jungian epistemology in order to develop his own work, and it would be important to examine the significance of this inter-pollination in relation to Jung’s own epistemology. The irony is that this part has been mostly neglected not only by Jungian authors but by Jung himself.</p>
                <p>To begin with it is important to be reminded that one of Bateson’s many creative and innovative projects was remarkably similar to that of Jung’s; he explained it succinctly as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Freudian psychology expanded the concept of mind inwards to include the whole communication system within the body ± the autonomic, the habitual, and the vast range of unconscious process. What I am saying expands mind outwards. And both of these changes reduce the scope of the conscious self. A certain humility becomes appropriate, tempered by the dignity or joy of being part of something much bigger.</p>
                    <p>(Bateson 1972: 461-462)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Even on the basis of this brief statement, it is possible to see immediately the similarities between Bateson and Jung—both looked for collective structures that affect the ways that individuals formulate their own knowledge; moreover, both had immense respect for that ‘something much bigger’ than the individual (cf. Relph 1987). Bateson went about establishing his project by observing a fundamental epistemological flaw in the Cartesian epistemology and used Jung to redress it:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I think that Descartes’ first epistemological steps ± the separation of ‘mind’ from ‘matter’ and the cogito ± established bad premises, perhaps ultimately lethal premises, for Epistemology, and I believe that Jung’s statement of connection between Pleroma and Creatura is a much healthier first step. Jung’s epistemology starts from comparison of difference—not from matter.</p>
                    <p>So I will define Epistemology as the science that studies the process of knowing—the interaction of the capacity to respond to differences, on the one hand, with the material world in which those differences somehow originate, on the other. We are concerned then with an interface between Pleroma and Creatura.</p>
                    <p>(Bateson and Bateson 1987: 18)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>‘Pleroma’ and ‘creatura’ are not part of the usual Jungian terminology. Jung first introduced these two terms in the long poem Septem Sermones ad Mortuos (Seven Sermons for the Dead) which he wrote between 1913 and 1916 (after he broke away from Freud) and circulated privately in 1925; it was published for the general public only in 1967. Jung hardly used these two terms again after this book, although it is understood that they formed the basic building blocks on which he developed further his ideas about archetypes and the collective unconscious (cf. Brenner 1990; Brewer 1996; Fodor 1964; Heisig 1972; Hoeller 1982; Hubback 1966; Jaffe 1972; Papadopoulos 1980; Segal 1992, 1995, 1998).</p>
                <p>In the Septem Sermones, Jung wrote that pleroma is</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Nothingness [which] is the same as fullness . . . A thing that is infinite and eternal has no qualities, since it has all qualities . . . Therein both thinking and being cease, since the eternal and infinite possess no qualities . . . In the pleroma there is nothing and everything.</p>
                    <p>(First Sermon)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This means that pleroma does not change.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>What is changeable, however, is creatura . . . The pleroma has all, distinctiveness and non-distinctiveness. Distinctiveness is creatura. Distinctiveness is its essence, and therefore it distinguishes. Therefore man discriminates because his nature is distinctiveness.</p>
                    <p>(First Sermon)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Bateson commented that</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The pleroma is the world in which events are caused by forces and impacts and in which there are no ‘distinctions’. Or, as I would say, no ‘differences’. In the creatura, effects are brought about precisely by difference. In fact, this is the same old dichotomy between mind and substance . . . I suggest that ‘pleroma’ and ‘creatura’ are words which we could usefully adopt, and it is therefore worthwhile to look at the bridges which exist between these two ‘worlds’. It is an oversimplification to say that the ‘hard sciences’ deal only with the pleroma and that the sciences of the mind deal only with the creatura. There is more to it than that.</p>
                    <p>(Bateson 1972: 456)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>What is this more about?</p>
                <p>Bateson was interested in understanding the dimensions of mind beyond the ordinary human conscious processes and outside the limits of the human skin, and observed that we can understand the mind also as</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>it applies to a much wider range of those complex phenomena called ‘systems’, including systems consisting of multiple organisms or systems in which some of the parts are living and some are not, or even to systems in which there are no living parts.</p>
                    <p>(Bateson and Bateson 1987: 19)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>His reference to ‘something bigger’ would resonate with the Jungian archetypal world which is beyond the individual but also within the person. But what then is ‘a mind’, asks Bateson, and adds:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>if this is a useful notion, can one usefully make a plural and speak of ‘minds’ which might engage in interactions which are in turn mental? . . . The definition anchors the notion of a mind firmly to the arrangement of material parts.</p>
                    <p>(Bateson and Bateson 1987: 18)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Some of the definition criteria he offers include: ‘A mind is an aggregate of interacting parts or components. The interaction between parts of mind is triggered by difference . . . Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains of determination’ (Bateson and Bateson 1987: 18-19).</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Using the cybernetic principles of feedback, Bateson understands a system as created by information that is exchanged by its parts within it and outside it, and defines information as ‘the difference which make a difference’. Asking again and again the question ‘What do I mean by ‘my’ mind?’, he replies:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I suggest that the delimitation of an individual mind must always depend upon what phenomena we wish to understand or explain. Obviously there are lots of message pathways outside the skin, and these and the messages which they carry must be included as part of the mental system whenever they are relevant.</p>
                    <p>(Bateson 1972: 458)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Bateson gives the example of ‘a tree and a man and an axe’ to show that these three form a system of a complete circuit within which differences take place: ‘if you want to explain or understand anything in human behavior, you are always dealing with total circuits’ (Bateson 1972: 459) which could also include, of course, inanimate objects which belong to the pleroma (e.g., the axe). ‘The elementary cybernetic system with its messages in circuit is, in fact, the simplest unit of mind’ (p. 459). Following this argument, Bateson writes:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The cybernetic epistemology which I have offered you would suggest a new approach. The individual mind is immanent but not only in the body. It is immanent also in pathways and messages outside the body; and there is a larger Mind of which the individual mind is only a subsystem.</p>
                    <p>(Bateson 1972: 461)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This ‘larger Mind’ (with capital M!) would indeed correspond to the Jungian collective unconscious and the epistemological implication would be that the knowing subject is part of a wider knowledge pool with which the individual is in interaction with. So much so, that Bateson went as far as defining a person (what he called a ‘self ‘ in inverted commas) ‘as a false reification of an improperly delimited part of this much larger field of interlocking processes’ (1972: 331). This resonates with Jung’s dictum: ‘Individuation is an at-one-ment with oneself and at the same time with humanity since oneself is part of humanity’ (Jung 1945: par. 227).</p>
                <p>Finally, Bateson applied his epistemological premises to comprehend psychopathological states and in so doing, he commented on Jung’s own mental state when he was writing the very poem Septem Sermones. Jung, many years after the event, wrote that at the time just before writing the poem his ‘whole house was filled as if there were a crowd present, crammed full of spirits’ (MDR, p. 216); Bateson attributed this to Jung’s epistemological confusion.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>If you get your epistemology confused, you go psychotic, and Jung was going through an epistemological crisis. So he sat down at his desk and picked up a pen and started to write. When he started to write all the ghosts disappeared and he wrote this little book [the Septem Sermones].</p>
                    <p>(Bateson 1972: 455)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Right at the beginning of the poem/book Jung wrote about the distinction between pleroma and creatura and, therefore, it seems that it was that differentiation which brought sanity to his confused ‘epistemological crisis’. Bateson wrote that according to ‘the vulgar jargon of psychiatry’ Jung’s ‘epistemological crisis’ would be called ‘psychotic’ (Bateson 1972: 455). This means that epistemology is not just an abstract concept but, constituting the very way one organises one’s knowledge, it can certainly also affect one’s psychological and mental state. It should not be forgotten that Bateson’s earlier double-bind theory of schizophrenia was also based on an epistemological perspective (Bateson 1956).</p>
                <p>Commenting on Jung’s idea that archetypes are ‘pleromatic’ (Jung 1952b), Bateson wrote: ‘It is surely true, however, that constellations of ideas may seem subjectively to resemble ‘forces’ when their ideational character is unrecognized’ (1972: 455n). This means that confusion between the archetypal content that interacts with the individual (creatura) and pure archetypes (pleroma) can lead to an epistemological crisis. If an individual appropriates pleromatic material he/she is then in danger of losing discrimination (and difference), and of ceasing to have awareness that he/she is only one interacting part of a wider system; such a misappropriation would not only be illusional but could also be delusional, indeed, as one would identify with the bigger whole, the entire system. Jung referred to this state as psychological inflation, when the archetype takes over one’s personality. Without the discrimination and differentiation, there is no information and therefore no system; instead, there is the illusion/delusion that there are just ‘forces’ that act on their own. Such a condition can lead an epistemological crisis to become even an epistemological breakdown.</p>
                <p>As Bateson emphasised, it is the interface between pleroma and creatura that is of importance, it is this interface, the interaction that creates a system that can utilise difference in order to be activated by the information that these differences create. Any alternatives are detrimental both epistemologically and psychologically. The individual cannot be confused with the collective, the archetype cannot substitute the individual. Here lies the unique clue to Jung’s use of archetypes that, on the one hand, they can be facilitative and healing in so far as they can enrich the individual personality by expanding its perspectives and opening it up to wider realms, making it aware of ‘being part of something much bigger’ (Bateson 1972: 462), or, on the other hand, they can flood the personality and take over it in a way that differences between them and the personality become blurred; in the latter case, archetypes would have a detrimental effect on the personality and they would create what could be called a pathological state.</p>
                <p>Echoing Jung, Bateson exclaimed that ‘A certain humility becomes appropriate, tempered by the dignity or joy of being part of something much bigger (Bateson 1972: 461-462).</p>
                <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jung’s Socratic ignorance and Gnostic knowledge</em></p>
                <p>The last facet of Jung’s epistemology that this chapter will examine is a duality of Jung’s own approach to epistemological openness. It has been suggested that one could</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>distinguish two opposing epistemologies which Jung, wittingly or unwittingly, actually espoused. The first of those is closer to what could be called ‘Socratic ignorance’, while the second is essentially a ‘Gnostic epistemology’.</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 1997: 298)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>According to the former,</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Jung stands clearly against any oversweeping statements of the ‘nothing but’ kind, and in the true spirit of Socratic ignorance makes such statements as ‘Stereotyped interpretation of dream-motifs is to be avoided . . . Even if one has great experience in these matters, one is again and again obliged, before each dream, to admit to one’s ignorance and, renouncing all preconceived ideas, to prepare for something entirely unexpected’ (Jung 1948: para. 543) or ‘. . . clearly, dreaminterpretation is in the first place an experience which has immediate validity for only two persons’ (para. 539).</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 1997: 298)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>These are characteristic statements of Jung’s insistence not to take anything for granted, not to assume any previous knowledge before examining a phenomenon in its own right, not to impose pre-packaged theoretical formulations onto a situation but, instead, retain an openness to examine the uniqueness of each given circumstance. In the clinical setting, this meant that Jung wanted to expose himself to the specificity of each analysand and endeavoured to grasp the meaning of his interaction with him/her at that given time without importing previous biases. This is why he maintained that the dream has meaning only in the context of the analytical interaction, i.e., between the analyst and the analysand.</p>
                <p>Socratic ignorance can be understood in two ways. The first refers to Socrates’ stance not to possess any wisdom but his only wisdom consisted of his awareness of his own ignorance. An example of this is presented in Plato’s Apology, where Socrates says,</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is—for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The second way of understanding the Socratic ignorance is in terms of the way he applied it in his conversations with others. This refers to his actual method of making use of his ‘ignorance’. Characteristically, Socrates tells Theaetetus: ‘You forget, my friend, that I neither know, nor profess to know, anything of these matters; you are the person who is in labour, I am the barren midwife’ (Plato’s Theaetetus). By asserting his own ignorance of the subject, Socrates frees himself and his interlocutor to investigate and explore the various underlying assumptions as well as dimensions of the phenomena they were discussing. In other words, his task was by and large epistemological in nature and he likened it to that of the midwife, i.e., to draw out of a person, to facilitate the birth of the knowledge about a certain topic, hence his method was termed ‘maieutic’ (maia, in Greek, being a midwife).</p>
                <p>There are striking similarities between the Socratic maieutics and the Jungian approach which did not elude Jung (e.g., Jung 1913: par. 519, 1943: par. 26, 1912: par. 437). In addition to adopting a ‘Socratic-ignorance’ approach in his analytical clinical work, Jung’s insistence that, above all, he was an ‘empiricist’ and ‘phenomenologist’ in his wider researches points to the same epistemological openness. He was very proud to quote a comment made about his empirical approach in the British Medical Journal (on 9 February 1952), ‘a source that would seem to be above suspicion. ‘Facts first and theories later is the keynote of Jung’s work. He is an empiricist first and last.’ This view meets with my approval’ (Jung 1952a: par. 1502). Also, distinguishing between an approach that follows blindly set theories as opposed to his own approach that used theoretical reflection to bind together his empirical findings, Jung expressed his epistemological credo as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Although I have often been called a philosopher, I am an empiricist and adhere as such to the phenomenological standpoint. I trust that it does not conflict with the principles of scientific empiricism if one occasionally makes certain reflections which go beyond a mere accumulation and classification of experience. As a matter of fact I believe that experience is not even possible without reflection, because ‘experience’ is a process of assimilation without which there could be no understanding. As this statement indicates, I approach psychological matters from a scientific and not from a philosophical standpoint. In as much as religion has a very important psychological aspect, I deal with it from a purely empirical point of view, that is, I restrict myself to the observation of phenomena and I eschew any metaphysical or philosophical considerations. I do not deny the validity of these other considerations but I cannot claim to be competent to apply them correctly.</p>
                    <p>(Jung 1938/1940: par. 2)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>It is not difficult to identify Jung’s ‘Socratic ignorance’ as it coincides with Jung’s own way that he characterised himself and with the way he has been characterised by almost all Jungian authors. What has not been examined often is Jung’s opposite epistemological stance that he also followed, evidently without him being aware of its antithetical direction; this was termed ‘Gnostic epistemology’ (Papadopoulos 1997). According to this epistemology, Jung was by no means open and his researches followed his own pre-established ideas about phenomena and, although he always waved the empiricist ‘Socratic-ignorance’ banner, in fact, his approach also included closed and predetermined epistemologies.</p>
                <p>The most striking single quotation that betrays Jung’s Gnostic epistemology is his reply to John Freeman’s question (in the famous Face to Face interview for BBC Television in 1959) ‘Do you now believe in God?’, to which Jung replied: ‘Difficult to answer. I know. I don’t believe. I know’ (McGuire and Hull 1977: 414).</p>
                <p>Jung ‘knew’ and no further explanation was needed. Such an approach to knowledge was not foreign to Jung and it can be found throughout his writings. However, in so far as he did not ever admit to it, there are no clear quotations in which he actually stated his adherence to this type of epistemology. Instead, his ‘Gnostic epistemology’ can be traced in his arguments. For example, in his Foreword to Father Victor White’s book, Jung claims that</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Psychology, like every empirical science, cannot get along without auxiliary concepts, hypotheses, and models. But the theologian as well as the philosopher is apt to make the mistake of taking them for metaphysical postulates. The atom of which the physicist speaks is not an hypostasis, it is a model. Similarly my concept of archetype or of psychic energy is only an auxiliary idea which can be exchanged at any time for a better formula.</p>
                    <p>(Jung 1952c: par. 460)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This sounds a fine expression of epistemological openness; however, as we know, neither Jung nor any Jungian author has ever exchanged the theory of archetypes with a ‘better formula’ and archetypes are not treaded as models but very much as actual hypostatic entities.</p>
                <p>In the very same paragraph, Jung states categorically that ‘In reality, . . . individuation is an expression of that biological process . . . by which every living thing becomes what it was destined to become from the beginning’ (Jung 1952c: par. 460). There is no hypothetical openness here; Jung declares dogmatically that ‘in reality’ this is how it is. Moreover, with an equal self-assuredness he pronounces that ‘This process naturally expresses itself in man as much as psychically as somatically’ and claims that such an assertion ‘is by no means a case of mystical speculations, but of clinical observations and their interpretations through comparison with analogous phenomena in other fields’. As if he gets intoxicated by his own words, in the next paragraph he actually goes as far as professing that ‘I proceed from facts which everyone is at liberty to verify’ (Jung 1952c: par. 461). By boasting this kind of objectivity and external verification, Jung unwittingly abandons his unique epistemology of psychic reality and psychological experiential interactions, and is seduced into adopting positivistic methodologies of the exact sciences which he criticises elsewhere as inappropriate for understanding the uniqueness of psychological phenomena.</p>
                <p>At the same time, such categorical claims not only fall very short of their target but also betray Jung’s closed system of beliefs. Within the space of two paragraphs he advocates epistemological openness, accepting his theories as working hypotheses and then, he moves to profess his definitive ‘knowledge’ of phenomena which in a tautological fashion confirm his theories. It is this kind of epistemology that was termed ‘Gnostic epistemology’ (Papadopoulos 1997); it is the epistemology that provides readymade answers, offers proclamations and views phenomena within a closed system of beliefs.</p>
                <p>Dehing, pointing to ‘an internal contradiction in Jung’s approach’, argues that ‘the agnostic empiricist every now and then turns into a prophet. Most of the time Jung’s opinions are formulated as hypotheses, but sometimes they become hypostases’ (Dehing 1990: 393). Thus, the agnostic and epistemological openness in Jung interchanges with Jung’s own Gnosticism which is characterised by his unshakable belief in the correctness of his own assertions and general theories, thus, runs in parallel to his own Socratic ignorance. When Jung adopts this kind of epistemology he implies ‘that certain insights are only available to the initiates’ (Papadopoulos 1997: 298). This kind of elitism was another characteristic of the Gnostic movement (Lee 1987).</p>
                <p>It has been argued that</p>

                    <p>the detrimental aspects and implications of Jung’s gnosticism have not yet been sufficiently appreciated; besides an elitist attitude, these include a closed system of circular tautology: people believe something to be true and whatever they see around them they judge according to these beliefs, while all the time they also believe that they are open and that their beliefs are based on real evidence. This approach cannot be enriched by new elements and therefore it cannot develop further; the initiates are convinced that their beliefs are absolutely true and correspond with the reality. This closed approach not only is self-fulfilling but it also promotes fanaticism.</p>
                    <p>(Papadopoulos 1997: 299)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This is not surprising because as even Hans Jonas admitted, ‘In the gnostic context . . . ‘knowledge’ has an emphatically religious or supernatural meaning and refers to objects which we nowadays should call those of faith rather than of reason’ (Jonas 1963/1992: 34); further, he also clarifies that in certain Gnostic authors, ‘the ‘knowledge’ is not only an instrument of salvation but itself the very form in which the goal of salvation, i.e., ultimate perfection, is possessed’ (p. 35). This confirms that what Jung was after was not just an epistemologically open hypothesis but a transformative kind of knowledge that would have far more than syllogistic functions and characteristics.</p>
                <p>The romantic idea of the Gnostic rebels who were against the establishment is only one side of the Gnostic tradition and this is the one that has been favoured by Jung and Jungians. Yet, there are other more unhelpful sides to Gnosticism that have not been taken into consideration seriously, as yet, by Jungian authors. The critiques of Gnosticism that, for example, Eric Voegelin (1968/2005), Manfred Henningsen (1999) and Philip J. Lee (1987) formulated are totally ignored by Jungians who seem entirely satisfied by the Gnostic proclamations to truth that Jung issued. It may be sobering to consider that, for example, the political philosopher Voegelin (1968) characterised both Marx and Hitler as modern Gnostics!</p>
                <p>In the clinical context, the opposite to Jung’s Socratic ignorance, i.e., his Gnostic epistemology, produces the Jung that, by virtue of feeling justified that he is in touch with the psyche, knows what is good for his clients and prescribes specific actions for them, a practice which is totally opposite to his Socratic openness. For example, Jung was also known to have been quite explicitly prescriptive to his analysands, telling them what specific actions and directions to take in their lives (e.g., Jung, MDR, pp. 156f ).</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Instead of conclusion</h3>
                <p>In so far as epistemology studies the ways we formulate what and how we know, it should be indispensable for a proper study of psychotherapeutic approaches. Jung’s ambivalent stance towards philosophy seems to have prevented him from acknowledging fully the implications of his own epistemological sensitivity. This chapter has endeavoured (within a severely restricted space) to present and discuss some of Jung’s epistemological positions that can contribute to the deeper understanding of the theory and practice not only of analytical psychology but also of other psychotherapeutic approaches.</p>
                <p>Jung has made a considerable contribution to the epistemology of psychology of therapeutic interactions and it is important that one appreciates his contribution in its totality (i.e., in the way the various parts of it interrelate) and not only in terms of its isolated elements. The last argument that this chapter developed, about Jung’s two opposing epistemological positions, does not invalidate his significant contribution. Like all great pioneers, Jung succumbed to the intoxication of his own discoveries and it was only human that there was also a streak in him that wanted to stick to his own theories and propagate them further with the fervour of a zealot. In other words, it is important to appreciate that there are two Jungs, so to speak—the one with an open epistemology and Socratic ignorance who was constructionist and relational, and the other Jung who, following Gnostic epistemology, was, in fact, essentialist and universalist.</p>
                <p>Further research in this field is much required in order to locate Jung’s contribution in the context of other investigations in the epistemology of psychotherapy (e.g., Barratt 1984; Christou 1963; Clark and Wright 1986; Goldberg 1988; Grunbaum 1984; Haynal 1993; Hogenson 2004; Knorr Cetina 1981, 1999; Mackay 1989; Mills 2004; Orange 1995; Phillips 1996; Ricoeur 1970, 1981; Rorty 1991; Spence 1982; Strenger 1991).</p>
                <p>As Jung himself emphasised, it is important to have diversity of views and not only to pursue one-sided perspectives: ‘No line of research which asserted that its subject was . . . a ‘nothing but’ has ever made any contribution to knowledge’ (Jung 1944: par. 120).</p>
