        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Introduction</h2>
        <p>I begin with a series of working definitions. My purpose in doing this is to empower the student of narrative, who can fall back on such definitions, test them against analyses and interpretations, and check their consistency. They are meant not to hold the truth of their object but rather to make it accessible and discussable.</p>
        <p><em>Narratology</em> as a field of study is the ensemble of theories of narratives, narrative texts, images, spectacles, events – of cultural artefacts that tell a story. Such theory helps us understand, analyse, and evaluate narratives. A theory is a systematic set of generalized statements about a particular segment of reality. That segment of reality, the corpus, about which narratology attempts to provide insight consists of narrative texts of all kinds, made for a variety of purposes and serving many different functions.</p>
        <p>If characteristics of narrative texts can be defined, these characteristics can serve as the point of departure for the next phase: a description of the way in which each narrative text is constructed. Then we have a description of a <em>narrative system</em>. On the basis of this description, we can examine the variations that are possible when the narrative system is concretized into narrative texts. This last step presupposes that an infinite number of narrative texts can be described using the finite number of concepts contained within the narrative system.</p>
        <p>Readers of this book are offered an instrument with which they can describe and, hence, interpret narrative texts. This does not imply that the theory is some kind of machine into which one inserts a text at one end and expects an adequate description to roll out at the other. The concepts that are presented here must be regarded as intellectual tools for interpretation. These tools are useful in that they enable their users to formulate an interpretive description in such a way that it is accessible to themselves as well as to others. Furthermore, discovering the characteristics of a text can also be facilitated by insight into the abstract narrative system. But above all, the concepts help increase understanding by encouraging readers to articulate what they understand, or think they understand, when reading or otherwise processing a narrative artefact.</p>
        <p>The textual description achieved with the help of this theory can by no means be regarded as the only adequate description possible. Someone else may use the same concepts differently, emphasize other aspects of the text, and, consequently, produce a different description. This variation is inevitable and felicitous, because reading is a fundamentally subjective activity. The point is, if the description of a text is understood as a proposal that can be presented to others, the fact that the description is formulated within the framework of a systematic theory facilitates discussion of the proposed description. This is a democratic use of a theory. This democratic nature of the joint activities of analysis, description, and interpretation I call <em>intersubjectivity</em>.</p>
        <p>Of what does this corpus of narrative texts consist? At first glance, the answer seems obvious: novels, novellas, short stories, fairy tales, newspaper articles, and more. But, intentionally or not, we are establishing boundaries – boundaries with which not everyone would agree. Some people, for example, argue that comic strips belong to the corpus of narrative texts, but others disagree. The underlying difference may be that, for the proponents, the fictional nature of the narrative is the standard; for the antagonists, the conception of literature inheres in the idea of narrative texts. Neither of these underlying ideas pertain to narrative, however. If these people hope to reach agreement, they will wish to explain how they have arrived at their decisions. And once they try, more differences will come up. For example, those who consider comic strips to be narrative texts interpret the concept <em>text</em> broadly. In their view, a text does not have to be a linguistic text. In comic strips, another, non-linguistic, sign system is employed – namely, the visual image. Others, sharing a more restricted interpretation of what constitutes a text, reserve this term for texts presented solely in language.</p>
        <p>As this simple example demonstrates, it helps to define the concepts we use and to restrict their content to singular ideas. This is not always obvious; think of very common and seemingly obvious notions such as <em>literature</em>, <em>text</em>, <em>narrative</em>, and <em>poem</em>; and <em>art</em>, <em>popular culture</em>, <em>context</em>. A disagreement about the status of comic strips would quickly be settled if the definition of a text were first agreed on. In other words, definitions are like a language: they provide something of a dictionary, so that one person understands what another means. But the definitions proposed here are provisional, serving before all else the purpose of being explicit and transparent enough that we can know what is relevant and what is not for the discussion at hand.</p>
        <p>Presenting a theory about narrative texts entails defining a number of central concepts. Within the scope of this introduction then, a <em>text</em> is a finite, structured whole composed of signs. These can be linguistic units, such as words and sentences, but they can also be different signs, such as cinematic shots and sequences, or painted dots, lines, and blots. The finite ensemble of signs does not mean that the text itself is finite, for its meanings, effects, functions, and backgrounds are not. It only means that there is a first and a last word to be identified, a first and a last image of a film, a frame of a painting – even if those boundaries, as we will see, are provisional and porous.</p>
        <p>For this book I have selected the following definitions. A <em>narrative text</em> is a text in which an agent or subject conveys to an addressee (“<span>tells</span>” the reader, viewer, or listener) a story in a medium, such as language, imagery, sound, buildings, or a combination thereof. A <em>story</em> is the content of that text and produces a particular manifestation, inflection, and “<span>colouring</span>” of a fabula. A <em>fabula</em> is a series of logically and chronologically related events that are caused or experienced by actors. These three definitions together constitute the theory this book elaborates.</p>
        <p>These key concepts imply other ones. Take the last one, the fabula, for example. Its definition contains the elements “<span>event</span>” and “<span>actor</span>”. An <em>event</em> is the transition from one state to another state. <em>Actors</em> are agents that perform actions. They are not necessarily human. To <em>act</em> is defined here as to cause or to experience an event. And this series of definitions can go on.</p>
        <p>The basis of this theory’s usefulness for analysis is the three-part division it proposes. The assertion that a narrative text is one in which a story is told implies that the text is not identical to the story, and the same holds for the relationship between story and fabula. Take the familiar fairy tale of Tom Thumb, about a small boy who outsmarts a dangerous ogre. Not everyone has read that story in the same text. There are different <em>versions</em>, that is, different texts in which that same story is related. Some texts are considered to be literary while others are not; some can be read aloud to children while others are too difficult or too frightening. Narrative texts differ from one another even if the related story is more or less the same. Here, “<span>text</span>” refers to narratives in any medium. I use this word with an emphasis on the finite and structured nature of narratives, not the linguistic nature of text.</p>
        <p>“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Tom Thumb</span>” can also help explain the next distinction, that between story and fabula. This distinction is based on the difference between the way in which the events are presented and the sequence of events as they occur in the imagined world of the fabula. That difference lies not only in the language used. Despite their having read different texts, readers of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Tom Thumb</span>” would agree, I expect, as to which of the characters deserves sympathy. They applaud the clever boy, and they rejoice at the ogre’s misfortunes. In order that Tom might triumph over his enemy, readers are quite prepared to watch unabashedly as Tom exchanges crowns so that the blind ogre unwittingly eats his own children. Evidently, in all of the texts this rather cruel fabula is presented in such a way that readers are willing to sacrifice one group of children for another. When “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Tom Thumb</span>” is told in another sign system – in a cartoon film, for example – similar reactions are evoked. This phenomenon demonstrates that something happens with the fabula that is not exclusively language-based.</p>
        <p>These definitions suggest that a three-layer distinction – text, story, fabula – is a good basis for the study of narrative texts. Such a distinction entails that it is possible to analyse the three layers separately. That does not mean that these layers <em>exist</em> independently of one another. They do not. The only material we have – that can be said to exist – is the text before us. Readers have only the book, paper and ink, or the strokes of paint on a canvas, the light in a dark (movie) theatre, the sound coming out of speakers, and they must use this material to establish the structure of the text themselves. Only the text layer, embodied in the sign system of language, visual images, or any other, is materially accessible. That a text can be divided into three layers is a theoretical supposition based on a process of reasoning, of which I have given a summary above.</p>
        <p>Layers serve as instrumental and provisional tools to account for particular effects the text has on its readers. The theory being presented in this introduction is based on the notion of distinct layers, such distinction being necessary for a detailed analysis. It is, therefore, inevitable that what is in effect inseparable should temporarily be disjoined. This goes to show that reading and analysing are distinct activities, even if they cannot be separated either. In order to analyse, one needs to read; and reading inevitably entails interpretive moments that will inform an analysis made later. As with the three layers, the activities involved in the processing of narratives cannot be separated, but must be distinguished in theory in order for us to understand the process.</p>
        <p>The fabula, understood as material or content that is worked into a story, has been defined as a series of events. This series is constructed according to certain rules. We call this the <em>logic of events</em>. If human behaviour is taken as the criterion for describing events, then the question of the function of the agents of action, the actors, arises. The actors can be described in relation to the events. However, two other elements in a fabula can be discerned. An event, no matter how insignificant, always takes up <em>time</em>. This time is often important for the continuation of the fabula and deserves, consequently, to be considered. If Tom Thumb had not had seven-miles boots at his disposal, he would never have been able to escape from the ogre in time. The difference between the time that Tom needs to escape from the giant’s grasp and the time that the giant needs to wake up is, in this case, decisive for the happy ending of the fabula. Furthermore, events always occur <em>somewhere</em>, be it a place that actually exists (Amsterdam) or an imaginary place (C.S. Lewis’s Narnia). Events, actors, time, and location together constitute the material of a fabula. I will refer to these as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">elements</em>.</p>
        <p>These elements are organized in a certain way into a story. Their arrangement in relation to one another is such that they can produce the effect desired, be this convincing, moving, disgusting, pleasing, or aesthetic. Several processes are involved in ordering the various elements into a story. These processes are not to be confused with the author’s activity – it is both impossible and useless to generalize about the latter. I distinguish the following:</p>
        <p>1 The events are arranged in a sequence that can differ from the chronological sequence.</p>
        <p>2 The amount of time allotted in the story to the various elements of the fabula is determined with respect to the amount of time these elements take up in the fabula.</p>
        <p>3 The actors are provided with distinct traits. Thus they are individualized and transformed into characters.</p>
        <p>4 The locations where events occur are also given distinct characteristics and are thereby transformed into specific places.</p>
        <p>5 Other relationships – symbolic, allusive, traditional – may exist among the various elements.</p>
        <p>6 A choice is made from among the various points of view from which the elements can be presented. The resulting <em>focalization</em>, the relation between who perceives and what is perceived, colours the story with subjectivity.</p>
        <p>The result is a specific story that is distinct from other stories. I will refer to the traits that are particular to a given story as <em>aspects</em>.</p>
        <p>A fabula that has been ordered into a story is still not a text. A narrative text is a story that is told, conveyed to recipients, and this telling requires a medium; that is, it is converted into <em>signs</em>. An agent who relates, who utters the signs, produces these signs. This agent cannot be identified with the writer, painter, composer, or filmmaker. Rather, the writer withdraws and calls upon a fictitious spokesman, the <em>narrator</em>.</p>
        <p>But the narrator does not relate continually. Whenever direct speech occurs in the text, it is as if the narrator temporarily yields this function to one of the actors. When describing the text layer, the key question is <em>who</em> is doing the narrating.</p>
        <p>A text does not consist solely of narration in the specific sense. In every narrative text, one can point to passages that concern something other than events, such as an opinion about something, for example, or information by the narrator that is not directly connected with the events – perhaps a description of a face or of a location. It is thus possible to consider what is said as narrative, descriptive, or argumentative. Such an analysis helps us assess the ideological or aesthetic thrust of a narrative. There is often a noticeable difference between the narrator’s style and that of the actors. As a result of this division into three parts, some topics that traditionally constitute a unified whole will be treated separately in different stages of this book. An example of this is the agent who performs the activities pertinent for each layer. This agent is called “<span>narrator</span>” or “<span>speaker</span>” in the study of the text, “<span>character</span>” in the study of the story, and “<span>actor</span>” in the study of the fabula.</p>
        <p>Ideally, the characteristics of narrative text should be as follows:</p>
        <p>1 Two types of “<span>speakers</span>” utter the signs that constitute a narrative text; one does not play a role in the fabula whereas the other does. The narrator who does not appear and never refers to itself, and thus is reduced to being a voice, has the same status as one who constantly interferes, comments, or identifies with an actor.</p>
        <p>2 We can distinguish three layers in a narrative text: the text, the story, and the fabula. Each of these layers can be described. The difficulty of distinguishing these is also a tool for understanding how they are intertwined.</p>
        <p>3 That with which the narrative text is concerned, the contents it conveys to its readers, is a series of connected events caused or experienced by actors presented in a specific manner.</p>
        <p>Logically speaking, the reader first sees the text, not the fabula. The fabula is really the result of the mental activity of reading; it is the interpretation by the reader, influenced both by the initial encounter with the text and by the manipulations of the story. The fabula is a memory trace that remains after the reading is completed. And how writers proceed we simply cannot know. Writers work mostly alone; filmmakers are part of a team. Narrative is a cultural phenomenon, one of the many cultural processes by which we live. The conditions of possibility of those processes are what constitute the interest of narrative analysis; there lays its cultural relevance.</p>
        <p>Together, these characteristics produce a definition: a narrative text is a text in which all three characteristics are found. These characteristics are not exclusive to narratives. The third feature also applies, for example, to films and dramatic texts. Moreover, there are texts that display all three characteristics but that nevertheless, on the basis of either tradition or intuition, people do not regard as narrative texts. This is true of many poems. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Waste Land</em> by T.S. Eliot is one of the numerous examples. A poem such as this may be termed a narrative poem, and its narrative characteristics may be narratologically described. That this does not often occur can be attributed to the fact that the poem displays other, more salient characteristics, such as poetic ones. Hence, the characteristics do not lead to an absolute delimitation of the corpus.</p>
        <p>This in turn implies that a narrative theory facilitates description only of the narrative aspects of a text and not all the characteristics, even of a clearly narrative text. It is, therefore, as impossible as it is undesirable to delimit a fixed corpus. This is an issue of <em>relevance</em> – the answer to the always useful question “<span>So what?</span>” We can demarcate a corpus of texts in which the narrative characteristics are so dominant that their description may be considered relevant. Alternatively, we can use the theory to describe segments of non-narrative texts as well as the narrative aspects of any given text, such as, for example, the poem by Eliot. Why bother with such analyses? A preliminary answer to the question of relevance is that narrative – or rather, the narrativity that makes artefacts narrative – grabs and holds the attention.</p>
        <p>A number of descriptive concepts follow from the development of the theory of such a narrative system. These concepts make possible a description of texts <em>to the extent that they are narrative</em>. In practice, the analyst will always make choices. Intuition often brings together a striking aspect of an artefact and a relevant theoretical element. On the basis of a careful reading of the text, as well as a careful attention to one’s reader’s response, one selects those elements of the theory that one thinks particularly relevant to the text. Those will be, I presume, the features that triggered one’s interest in the first place. This is why this theory is compatible with reception-oriented approaches.</p>
        <p>The textual description that results provides the basis for interpretation, from which it cannot be firmly distinguished. Interpretation is involved every step of the way. Precisely for that reason a systematic theory is helpful, not to eliminate or bracket interpretation but to make it arguable. An interpretation is a proposal. If a proposal is to be accepted, it must be well founded. If it is based on a precise description it can be discussed, even if, in practice, the intuitive interpretation preceded the analysis. The theory presented here is an instrument for making descriptions, and hence interpretations, discussable. That, not objectivity or certainty, “<span>being right</span>” or “<span>proving wrong</span>”, is the point.</p>
        <p>Such discussions are possible and relevant because interpretation is both subjective and susceptible to cultural constraints. Those constraints define each reader as a cultural being, as a participant in a continuous discussion about meaning. Endorsing that view entails an interest in framings – those constraints that make the process of interpretation of more general interest. This turns narrative analysis into an activity of <em>cultural analysis</em>, for the subjectivity in analysis is a larger cultural issue. Subjectivity, understood as the crossing, in culture, of individual and social existence, also characterizes the concepts themselves. The provisional definitions given above, and the more elaborate ones that follow, have in common a special focus on <em>agency</em>. To talk about narrators, for example, is to impute agency to a subject of narration, even if this subject is not to be identified with the narrator. I will explain that focalizers, in the story, are the agents of perception and interpretation. Actors, in the fabula, are the subjects of action. This attention paid to agency – and, hence, to subjectivity – is indeed the basic tenet of the theory presented in this book. It insists on the complex manner in which narrative communicates.</p>
