                </header>
                <p>I call <em>aspects</em> those features that distinguish the structured story from, on the one hand, the text, and on the other, the fabula. A simple rule of thumb – if deceptively so – is this. If one regards the text primarily as the product of the use of a medium, and the fabula primarily as the product of the imagination, the story could be regarded as the result of an ordering; as orientated, focused, fleshed out; in short, as subjectivized. The distinction does not imply that the one layer exists before the other. The aim of textual analysis is not to account for the process of writing, but for the conditions of the process of reception. Thus, the following questions underlie this part: How is it that a narrative text comes across to the reader in a certain manner? Why do we find the same fabula beautiful when presented by one writer and trite when presented by another? Why is it so difficult in a simplified edition of a classic, or of a masterpiece of world literature, to preserve the power of the original? And why are we so frequently disappointed by a film adaptation of a great novel? All of these questions are poor ones insofar as they imply a hierarchy, the priority of the earlier version, or a preference for a medium. But it remains meaningful to ask them in order to assess how the will be at least equally dependent on the way the material, the fabula, has been manipulated.</p>
                <p>Manipulation originally meant simply “<span>handling</span>”, “<span>treatment</span>”, and even though its modern sense has shifted to include more negative connotations, the original meaning is still synonymous with “<span>operation</span>”. The fabula is “<span>treated</span>”, and the reader is being manipulated by this treatment. Such manipulation occurs not only in that actors are turned into specific, fleshed-out characters, placed in specific spaces with mutual symbolic and circumstantial relations. Something else is inevitably involved when a series of events is turned into a story. The primary means of manipulation is what is traditionally known as point of view or “<span>perspective</span>”. The view from which the elements of the fabula are being presented is often of decisive importance for the meaning the reader will assign to the fabula. This concept plays a part in the most everyday situations. A conflict is best judged by letting each party give his or her own version of the events: their own story. Focalization, then, is the technical aspect, the placing of the point of view in or with a specific agent. Thus it is the principal tool for subjectifying the story. But many other aspects participate in that operation.</p>
                <p>Some aspects of the story are a consequence of a sort of “<span>story logic</span>”. Depending on how classical, realist, modernist, postmodernist or otherwise experimental a narrative is, readers expect certain consistencies in time, place, focalization; and they are annoyed when unexplained jumps occur. Other aspects seem random but may have a profound causality only discovered when the reader or viewer accepts that randomness is relative. I will give examples of such expectation-dependent forms of manipulation.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">2: Temporality</h3>
                <p>In one sense, time is a given, self-evident for the time-based arts – narrative, theatre, film, video, dance, music. These arts unfold in time. But for our purposes here, it is the many ways in which narratives complicate this apparently self-evident temporality that are of interest.</p>
                <p>The time that regulates our lives by means of clocks, schedules, and other forms of regimentation is so incorporated, interiorized, or naturalized that it is difficult to imagine that conflicts are built into it. The <em>day-to-day time</em> of schedules does not align with the long-term sense of time we learn mainly from history. <em>Monumental time</em> denies even <em>historical time</em>; it aspires to eternity. At the other end of this continuum, brief moments and variations in intensity of experience cross through the regulated time of one’s daily activities. These tensions shift throughout one’s life. Mothers with small children live in a rhythm that is stricter than that of the other parent (if present) or of mothers of older children. The routine of small acts of care determines the experience of time – even sleep is no longer continuous. We could call it <em>micro time</em>.</p>
                <p>Time is thick and complex, not at all linear and single-stranded. To grasp this thickness of time, imagine the life of an undocumented immigrant. The moment of border crossing occurs after a long journey. The heightened danger intensifies that moment, even if it can take days to actually cross. Once inside the new country, the immigrant’s inner clock starts ticking. The justification for the departure, for leaving behind family and friends, is to make money to help out at home. But as long as residency permits and work permits are not forthcoming, much of the immigrant’s time is spent waiting. This produces a kind of social schizophrenia that makes the migrant always rushing and always stagnating at the same time, and this is a different experience of time than that of the host country’s residents. If and when the long-awaited documents finally arrive, the hoped-for relief is slow in coming. The time lost is also a loss of the opportunity to learn the new language, acquire work skills, and make new friends. People in such situations are condemned to live in the present. As a consequence, the memories of their past that should sustain them are put on ice. This living in an enforced presentism is a symptom of disenfranchisement.</p>
                <p>Once we realize this, the thickness of time becomes impressively complex. Looking at temporality in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arabian Nights</em> is rewarding, for example. The king, who kills all virgins at the end of the night, is a slave to day-today time. He suffers from chronophobia, the fear that time is the enemy’s gain, as much as from gynophobia, the fear that women have a life and desires of their own and hence, a subjectivity. In response to the king’s disease, Sheherazade steals time, or borrows it. But how can you borrow something, or steal it, when it has no owner? She needs to make things very complicated to overcome this hurdle. She does so by seducing the king into the different temporality of her stories. This temporality is itself complex. It comprehends at the very least the time of telling, the time of the events, and the suspense of time wherein these two do not match up. That is, she borrows time from narrative, not from the king.</p>
                <p>Here I present only three forms of temporality that emerge specifically from the three-tiered narrativity that underlies this book’s theoretical principles. The characterizations of different temporal experiences outlined above will remain a useful interpretive backdrop while, below, I sketch the technical devices that narratives deploy to produce such experiences for their readers.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">3: Sequential Ordering</h3>
                <p>In these subsections the relations are being explored that hold between the order of events in the story and their chronological sequence in the fabula. The latter sequence is a theoretical construction, which we can develop on the basis of the laws of everyday logic that govern common reality. According to that logic one cannot arrive in a place before one has set out to go there. In a story that is possible, however.</p>
                <blockquote>a John rang the neighbours’ doorbell. He had so irresistibly felt the need to stand eye to eye with a human being that he had not been able to remain behind the sewing machine.</blockquote>
                <p>This is a quite ordinary passage, which no one would be surprised to come across in a narrative text. But everyone knows that in “<span>reality</span>” (fictitious or not), the sequence of events must have been the other way around: first John must have felt the desire to go and see someone; then he acted accordingly and went to ring a friend’s doorbell. The reader assumes this, but such assumptions are narrative effects; they do not imply that there exists, or has ever existed, such a series of events, in that order.</p>
                <p>Information is needed for such a confrontation between the ordering of events in the story and their sequence in the fabula. The latter can be inferred from explicit information or from indirect indications. In a, for example, the tenses of the verbs in the text indicate the sequence of events: simple past for the later event; past perfect for the preceding events. But even without such indications in the text there is information that, with our sense of everyday logic, we can combine in such a way that we can say, “<span>The ringing of that doorbell is likely to be the result of the occurrence of the desire</span>”.</p>
                <p>At least one argument for the relevance of such an investigation can be given. Unlike various other art forms – architecture, visual arts – a written text is linear. One word or image follows another; one sentence or sequence follows another; and when one has finished the book or the film is over, one has sometimes forgotten the beginning. It is even customary to speak of a double linearity: that of the text, the series of sentences or sequences; and that of the fabula, the series of events. Moreover, narrative texts are usually fairly long – longer than most poems – which is why one tends to read them straight through, not retracing one’s steps, as one does more easily in the case of poems. There are various ways of breaking such linearity, compelling the reader to read more intensively. Deviations in sequential ordering may contribute to intense reading, for example. If deviations in sequential ordering correspond with conventions, they will not stand out. They can, however, be so intricate as to exact the greatest exertions in following the story. In order not to lose the thread it is necessary to keep an eye on the sequential ordering, and the very effort forces one to reflect also on other elements and aspects. Playing with sequential ordering is not just an artistic convention; it is also a means of drawing attention to certain things, to emphasize, to bring about aesthetic or psychological effects, to produce suspense, to show various interpretations of an event, to indicate the subtle difference between expectation and realization, and much else besides. It is narrative’s way of achieving a density that is akin to the simultaneity often claimed for visual images as distinct from literature.</p>
                <p>Not all narratives are so complex or, for that matter, so gripping. Turns of phrase such as</p>
                <p>b Little could I then foresee</p>
                <p>c Only yesterday I was thinking</p>
                <p>point in their own way at different interpretations of events. In b speaks, let’s say, a disillusioned old man looking back on the mistakes he made in his youth; in c someone may have recently discovered some important information on the basis of which she has changed her opinion. Often, the misapprehensions of actors who are not in possession of the correct information are afterwards cleared up and explained in this way on the level of story.</p>
                <p>In the children’s book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Something Very Sorry</em> (see chapter 1), the child whose voice is the narrator needs the chronological deviations to convey the sense of loss in the character:</p>
                <p>– I’m in the hospital.</p>
                <p>– The others are also injured. That’s why they don’t come to take me home.</p>
                <p>– Doctors and nurses keep coming in to examine me. They tell me what happened – we crashed into a tree. It was a serious accident. These words stick in my head. 7</p>
                <p>The movement back and forth from present to past to present is the story’s basic rhythm. The girl’s slowly returning memories of the accident alternate with her experiences in the hospital and the happy past before the car crash. These delicate alternations contribute to the story in a very meaningful way: they provide insight into the broken sense of self of the traumatized child in a modulation that makes the reader experience it with her on an emotional level as well. In what follows, I give examples of three aspects of chronological deviation: direction, distance, and range.</p>
                <p>Differences between the arrangement in the story and the chronology of the fabula are called chronological deviations or <em>anachronies</em>. Practically all novels contain anachrony – even emphatically chronological novels, such as Dutch writer Gerard van het Reve’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Evenings</em> (1947). Deviations from chronology tend to be more drastic when the fabula is more complex. Sometimes this seems to be the result of the need to explain much in a complicated fabula. The explanation often takes the form of reference to the past. Also, the difficulty of bringing the many different threads of a fabula together to form a coherent unity may create the need to refer back or point ahead. In particular, the “<span>classic</span>” novel, after the model of the nineteenth-century realistic novel, makes much use of this possibility. A conventional construction of a novel is the beginning <em>in medias res</em>, which immerses the reader in the middle of the fabula. From this point she is referred back to the past, and from then on the story carries on more or less chronologically through to the end.</p>
                <p>However, anachrony can also be used to realize specific literary effects. A chaotic temporality can even be concealed behind an apparent chronology, as in Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> (1967) and Marguerite Duras’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’après-midi de Monsieur Andesmas</em> (1962). In other respects, these two novels are totally different. The significance, therefore, that can be attached to this astonishing game with chronology is equally different. The effect of Garcia Marquez’s novel is to allow people, generations, and social contexts to succeed each other in rapid turmoil over the course of a hundred years that seem to contain a history of mankind, terminating in the absurd failure of (communal) life. Duras simply makes a man wait three hours for his daughter, and presents in those three hours the vision of a growing despair through a mixture of inertia and chronological chaos, indolence and the effort to endure that indolence – one of the tragic aspects of the aging person, who must continue living when socially and emotionally he is already dead. In neither novel is it easy to grasp the deviations in sequential ordering; both seem strictly chronological. Here, too, the “<span>failure</span>” of an analysis done with the aid of a systematic concept is a significant result in itself. The analysis is based not on the application of a concept that is, like a master code, beyond questioning, but rather on a confrontation between theoretical concept and narrative text that is mutually illuminating.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Direction</em></strong></p>
                <p>Seen from that moment in the fabula that is being presented when the anachrony intervenes, the event presented in the anachrony lies either in the past or in the future. For the first category I use the term <em>retroversion</em>; for the second, <em>anticipation</em>. I avoid the more common terms “<span>flashback</span>” and “<span>flashforward</span>” because of their vagueness and psychological connotations. An example of a complete anachrony is the beginning of Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>:</p>
                <blockquote>d Sing, Goddess, the anger of Peleus’ son Achilles and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon the Achaians, hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished since that time when first there stood in division of conflict Atreus’ son the lord of men and brilliant Achilles.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>What god was it that set them together in bitter collision? Zeus’ son and Leto’s, Apollo, who in anger at the king drove the foul pestilence along the host, and the people perished, since Atreus’ son had dishonoured Chryses, priest of Apollo, when he came beside the fast ships of the Achaians to ransom back his daughter, carrying gifts beyond count and holding in his hands wound on a staff of gold the ribbons of Apollo who strikes from afar, and supplicated all the Achaians but above all Atreus’ two sons, the marshals of the people: “<span>sons of Atreus and you other strong-grieved Achaians, to you may the gods grant who have their homes on Olympus Priam’s city to be plundered and a fair homecoming thereafter, but may you give me back my own daughter and take the ransom, giving honour to Zeus’ son who strikes from afar, Apollo</span>”.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>book 1, 59</blockquote>
                <p>The first object presented here is the grudge of Achilles. Subsequently we are told about the distress of the Achaeans, which resulted from it. Then the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon is treated, which, as the direct cause of Achilles’s anger, should precede it. The disease (the plague) is, in turn, the cause of the dispute, and the insult to Chryses was its cause in turn. I indicate the five units presented with A, B, C, B, E in the order in which they are presented in the story.</p>
                <p>Chronologically, their positions are 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, so that the anachronies can be represented by the formula A4-B5-C3-D2-E1. Clearly, with the exception of the beginning, they form a direct return to the past. This beginning of the <em>Iliad</em> fits the convention that prescribes that one indicates what the story will be about. The apparently endless series of causes and effects shows, moreover, how strongly the vicissitudes of human beings are determined by powers beyond them. And at the same time the reader is, already at the beginning, presented with a summary of the book’s contents: the summary that the muse is asked to sing is what the reader will hear.</p>
                <p>The following example, from a modern story this time, gives a sense of how to analyse chronological manipulation, and why. It shows an entirely different sequential ordering from the examples above:</p>
                <p>e a I saw that he could not take it. With a haggard face he looked at what was left of Massuro. He wanted a reason – otherwise, where was he? And the only thing that could pass for a reason, with a great deal of good (and occult) faith, was fear. b But there was no fear. Massuro hadn’t known what fear was. c I knew Massuro well, in a manner of speaking. d So I shall tell it to you as if you were a friend, Gentlemen, although it’s a mystery to me what you will do with the information when you have it.</p>
                <blockquote>e Two years ago, when he was posted to my section at Potapego, I happened to be standing jabbering to the village headman. The truck from Kaukenau arrived, and out of the cab stepped a swarthy, heavily built fellow with a big head, round eyes and thick lips. f Then, suddenly, I saw his name in the Major’s letter before me again. g “<span>Heintje Massuro!</span>”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Harry Mulisch, “<span>What Happened to Sergeant Massuro?</span>” (126)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>The capital letters indicate the various chronological parts into which the fragment can be divided.</blockquote>
                <p>This fragment is taken from a Dutch short story that made a strong impression on me in high school. Harry Mulisch (1927–2010) lived with his German-Austrian father after his parents divorced. His mother was Jewish. The war influenced him deeply. Mulisch elaborated his philosophy throughout his oeuvre, and explicitly in his <em>De compositie van de wereld</em> (The Composition of the World; 1980). For him, art is the only possible way of understanding and knowing the world. Reality only becomes meaningful when it is re-created in art. Language possesses a sheer-magical power that allows the writer to create and to conquer time. For Mulisch, the mystical philosopher Pythagoras was the first true artist. The collection of short stories <em class="notranslate" translate="no">What Happened to Sergeant Massuro?</em> (1972) contains the story with the same title, which was written in 1955. The story consists of a report, written by Massuro’s friend at the request of the Ministry of War, in which the friend tries to explain, or rather to understand, the mysterious event that happened to Massuro: his slow petrification during an expedition in the jungle of New Guinea. The personal-language situation is relevant for an understanding of the story, which, with its dense symbolic structure, is reminiscent of Joseph Conrad’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Heart of Darkness</em> (1899).</p>
                <p>Chronologically, all parts but one precede the story-time proper. That <em>one</em> is the moment when the I-narrator, reporting the events, addresses the Dutch authorities, the War Department, with these words: “<span>It is a calm man who is writing this to you – a man with the calm that comes to the surface when hope has fled</span>”. I would infer here that we are going to be presented with some kind of fantastic story that has ended unhappily. In a the speaker is in contact with a medical officer – a rather emotional sort of contact, as far as we can judge. No wonder, since there is between them the “<span>remains</span>” of a human body, the body of Massuro, who has gradually turned into stone. b treats the possible fears of Massuro, who has already died in a.</p>
                <p>So, in the fabula, b precedes a. c covers a longer period – let us say from the renewed acquaintance between Massuro and the speaker, and the beginning of the sinister events, whether or not they were caused by the fears mentioned in b. In d we return to the story’s present: the I is writing his report to the department. e recalls the moment at which the renewed acquaintance in New Guinea took place, and thus immediately precedes c, or rather e introduces the beginning of c. f lies even deeper in the past: the speaker recalls the moment when, before Massuro’s arrival, he sees his name mentioned in a letter. Indicating the various parts with capital letters, and their chronological position with numbers, the following formula ensues: A5-B4-C3-D6-E2-F1-G2.</p>
                <p>The fragment began with a haggard look and confusion; it ends in the placidity of a renewed meeting with the man – “<span>Heintje Massuro!</span>” The contrast between the familiar Dutch first name and the exotic surname is striking – something like the contrast between “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Chuck</span>” and “<span>Charles</span>”, not unlike Suleiman’s “<span>Mother</span>” and “<span>Daddy</span>”. In view of the mysterious events that happened to the man in question, this contrast, combined with the conflicting circumstances of the actors (a conflict already present in the colonial name of the place, Dutch New Guinea), is by no means accidental. The chronological sequence of events, so clearly violated here, is broadly maintained from this passage onwards. But this confused beginning has already given us a picture of the confusion that underlies the fabula as a whole.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Nuances of Anachrony</em></strong></p>
                <p>I have ignored one thing in this analysis. The chronological deviations are not all of the same order. f, for instance, takes place in the “<span>consciousness</span>” of the first-person actor. In fact, the event is not the seeing of the name, but the remembering of the seeing. Note that again, there is a coincidence of anachronical complexity and an emulation with visual perception. In that sense the fragment is not a chronological deviation, and it belongs to e (“<span>Then</span>”). In many texts, however, one finds this type of “<span>unreal</span>” anachrony almost exclusively.</p>
                <p>In e, I labelled the time in which the speaker writes the letter as primary. With respect to this primary time, all the events that actually constitute the contents of the fabula – the gradual fossilization of Sergeant Massuro – are retroversions. If the rest of the story were now to be presented chronologically, it would be pointless to note in each sentence that we are concerned with fabula-time 2, the period of renewed acquaintance until the death of Massuro. In Mulisch’s text, for instance, it is also possible to take 2, the time of renewed acquaintance, as the starting point and consequently to view all references to periods 3 up to and including 6, the writing of the letter to the Ministry of War, as anticipation.</p>
                <p>The question as to which time segment is primary can be highly charged. An example is Patrick Chamoiseau’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Texaco</em>, set in Martinique, an intricate narrative (1992). In this text what first seems to be the primary story line, in which an urban planner comes to the neighbourhood of Texaco in order to erase it, is interrupted by the secondary story told by Marie-Sophie, who provides the place that is about to be erased with a past that makes the erasure impossible. As a result, the urban planner converts and becomes the saviour of the site. Which line of the fabula comes chronologically first is clear: the past, embedded one. This embedded fabula then takes over and becomes the main one that rearranges the rest of the fabula set in the present. The point is not to decide this unambiguously, but on the contrary, to acknowledge the important effect of the irresolvable conflict between the technical subordination of the past and its power to change the present.</p>
                <p>Not all anachronies have the same narrative status. “<span>Stream-of-consciousness</span>” literature, for instance, limits itself to the reproduction of the contents of consciousness, and thus is not subject to chronological analysis at all. To solve this problem, and in order to be able to indicate in other texts the difference between such “<span>false</span>” anachronies and others, I introduce the terms <em>subjective</em> and <em>objective</em>. A subjective anachrony is an anachrony that can be only be regarded as such if the contents of consciousness lie in the past or in the future – not the past of being conscious, but the moment of thinking itself.</p>
                <p>One final problem, however, is in some cases insoluble. Once again, example e serves to demonstrate it. There I stated that c covers the period between the renewed acquaintance of the I-speaker with Massuro and the latter’s death. That this is the period concerned seems probable in view of the fact that it is during this segment of time that the events occurred that the speaker must relate. However, as we continue to read Mulisch’s text, it becomes clear that the two actors knew each other before then. So it is no longer possible to determine whether c refers to the period in New Guinea alone, or whether the time that they knew each other in Holland is also included. In the case of Massuro, we have already been confronted with traces of confusion between the periods in Holland and New Guinea.</p>
                <p>A similar problem arises when a retroversion or anticipation is presented as direct discourse. Properly speaking, here too there is no question of a real anachrony. The moment of speech is simply part of the (chronological) story; only in the contents are past or future mentioned. Example a, for example, could continue as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>f Sobbing, John sat on his neighbour’s couch, pouring out his woes. “<span>I didn’t know, when I married Mary five years ago, that she would sacrifice everything to her work, did I? That I would be no more to her than a cheap servant, always at hand to pour her a drink and fetch her an ashtray?</span>”</blockquote>
                <p>The outburst itself chronologically follows the ringing of the doorbell in a. But the substance of John’s lament has to do with the past – with his marriage five years ago and the entire period from his wedding to the present moment. This issue of narrative levels has been treated in the previous chapter. Here we need only note that the above constitutes a retroversion of the second degree, since speech takes place on the second level.</p>
                <p>A third issue concerns the position of the narrative units we have distinguished with respect to each other. Which time should we consider the primary story-time – that is, the time in relation to which the other units may be called anticipations? Obviously, the answer to this question is relative. There are texts, moreover, in which the relationship between story and fabula is so complex that a thorough analysis would be useless. In such cases a rough indication of the different time units suffices, and interesting or complex fragments can be studied in detail. This is the method Gerard Genette has used in his analysis of Proust’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">À la recherche du temps perdu</em> (written 1908–22), a novel of more than four thousand pages. The question as to which time can be declared primary is not especially significant; what is relevant is to place various time units in relation to each other.</p>
                <p>Finally, a fourth complication. Sometimes anachronies are embedded in each other, so closely intertwined that it becomes too difficult to analyse them. Such is the case with the second-degree retroversion in f: “<span>when I married her five years ago</span>”. The contents of John’s words are a retroversion: the words “<span>I didn’t know ... did I</span>” belong to it, but that which follows, the substance of the knowing, is, with respect to “<span>five years ago</span>”, in turn a (subjective) anticipation. This is borne out clearly by the form of the verb itself, “<span>would sacrifice</span>”.</p>
                <p>I have raised these issues mainly to dispel the illusion that sequential analysis is simple, but also to indicate the myriad possibilities of variation available if we wish to experience the structural thickness of a story compared to its fabula. One final problem, however, is in some cases insoluble. In some contexts it is impossible to ascertain whether the word <em>bank</em> refers to a financial institution or the side of a river; the word and its homonym look and sound identical. So too it may impossible to determine which period in the fabula is being referred to. And just as it is possible to use puns to achieve certain effects (confusion, humour, a sense of the absurd), so too chronological <em>homonymy</em> may be purposefully employed for the same effect. This is why in such cases acknowledging it as an <em>achrony</em> is more helpful than developing yet another category, as if classifying would rid us of the problem.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Distance</em></strong></p>
                <p>An event presented in anachrony is separated by an interval, long or short, from the present; that is, from the moment in the development of the fabula with which the story is concerned at the time the anachrony interrupts it. On the basis of <em>distance</em>, we may distinguish two kinds of anachrony. Whenever a retroversion takes place completely outside the time span of the primary fabula, we refer to an external retroversion. If the retroversion occurs within the time span of the primary fabula, then we refer to an internal retroversion. If the retroversion begins outside the primary time span and ends within it, we refer to a mixed retroversion. The same applies to anticipations – but these occur much less frequently. With respect to the latter, too, three possibilities can be discerned: external, internal, and mixed.</p>
                <p>Massuro’s arrival in Potapego occurs, as is indicated, two years prior to the writing of the letter. The other time units are more difficult to pinpoint, although we do know that a should be placed after the death of Massuro and shortly before the writing of the letter, since the doctor’s examination and the writing of the letter are both part of the administrative winding up of the extraordinary death, that is, the certification of the cause of death – a process usually carried out as speedily as possible. Somewhat later in the text we notice that this period covers six days.</p>
                <p>In Butor’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em> the distance is much greater. The primary story-time is the train journey from Paris to Rome. The subjective retroversions to the past, and the broken marriage of the man making that journey, span a distance of years. Facts from the present, things observed during the journey, are associated with facts stored in his memory. Clearly, all of the flashbacks in this narrative are subjective. Whenever a retroversion takes place completely outside the time span of the primary fabula, we call it an external retroversion. This is the case in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em>, if we take only the return journey to be the primary fabula.</p>
                <p>Fragment a from example e (Massuro) becomes an internal retroversion if we take as our primary time span the period running from the renewed acquaintance until the “<span>present</span>”, the writing of the letter. If, however, we view only the writing of the letter as the primary fabula, all retroversions become external. As a rule of thumb it seems to make more sense to opt for the solution that helps account for the greatest number of phenomena. Consequently, in this case, our choice falls on the first one. Thus we establish as our primary time span the period between the meeting and the writing. If, as I propose, we then view c as a chronological homonymy, this retroversion becomes a mixed one: starting before the meeting in Potapego, it continues until Massuro’s death.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Functions</em></strong></p>
                <p>I have already suggested that in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em> the subjective retroversions explained the man’s dissatisfaction with his wife and his nervousness about the confrontation with his mistress. The very fact that these are subjective retroversions increases, in this case, the explanatory function: dissatisfaction is subjective, after all. This, incidentally, demonstrates the potentially political importance of such narratological aspects.</p>
                <p>At one point in “<span>What Happened to Sergeant Massuro?</span>” an anecdote is recalled about the schooldays of the two actors, their first meeting, and the mutual feelings of friendship that neither of the two ever expressed. This anecdote elucidates the odd, sober relationship between the two men in New Guinea, which in turn accounts for the narrator’s inability to explain Massuro’s strange death, even while he denies so vociferously that fear was the cause. More and more, it becomes likely that a colonial problematic underpins this story. All of this corresponds to the other facts we have discovered in this text. Because of all these aspects, the peculiar atmosphere of menacing mystery in this text becomes stronger and stronger. The genre of the fantastic, I am beginning to sense, serves the purpose of a colonial perspective.</p>
                <p>External retroversions generally provide indications about the antecedents, the past of the actors concerned, insofar as that past can be relevant for the interpretation of events. Internal retroversions often (partly) overlap with the primary narrative; they may overtake it. They do not do so when the information communicated by the internal retroversion is new, when it is a sidetrack of the fabula. This is the case when information is given about a newly introduced actor, who during the events of the primary fabula has been concerned with other things that afterwards turn out to have been important.</p>
                <p>If the contents of an internal retroversion overlap with those of the primary fabula, the retroversion usually serves as compensation for a gap in the story. This occurs because the information was not yet complete. There may be a gap in chronological succession, for instance. When we are told, in one chapter of a novel, that the heroine is pregnant, and when, at the beginning of the next chapter, we find ourselves in the baby’s room, now in use, the information about the delivery is missing. In Victorian novels such a gap in the flow of information, such an <em>ellipsis</em>, will, for decency’s sake, not have been filled. The ellipsis – a form to which I will return shortly – can also be maintained for more specific reasons. In Flaubert’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em>, the end of the first part – “<span>When they left Tostes, Madame Bovary was pregnant</span>” – skips the conception; indeed, that skipping is enhanced by the succinctness of the narrator’s sentence. This serves to underline the great disappointment of Emma’s marriage, specifically its sexual poverty. A less economical narrator might erase such ellipses by means of internal retroversion.</p>
                <p>Internal retroversions can have yet another function. When they do not fill up an ellipsis or <em>paralipsis</em> (i.e., lack of information concerning a sidetrack), but instead elaborate on information already given, they seem to be a repetition. The repetition of a previously described event can change, or add to, the meaning of that event. The same event is presented as more – or less – pleasant, innocent, or important than we had previously believed it to be. It is thus both identical and different: the fabula elements are the same, but their meaning has changed. The past receives a different significance.</p>
                <p>In Proust, such internal retroversions form part of the famous and specifically Proustian interruption of the linearity in searching for and recovering the elusive past. But in much simpler literature too, frequent use is made of such possibilities. Detective novels and all kinds of texts constructed around mysteries, masquerades, and puzzles adopt this technique as an important structural device.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Span</em></strong></p>
                <p>The term <em>span</em> indicates the stretch of time covered by an anachrony. Like its distance, the span of an anachrony may vary greatly. If a letter states</p>
                <p>h Last year, I went to Indonesia for a month.</p>
                <p>the span of the retroversion is a month, while its distance is a year. In Couperus’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> (1906), all of the allusions to the murder in “<span>the Indies</span>” are subjective (when the old people again call the scene to mind) or second-degree (when they talk about it) external retroversions with a distance of sixty years, and a span that varies from a quarter of an hour to one night to, at times, a few days.</p>
                <p>The anachrony is either incomplete or complete. A retroversion, for instance, is incomplete if after a (short) span a forward jump is made once again. Disconnected information is thus given about a section of the past, or, in the case of an anticipation, of the future. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> the retroversions concerning the murder are incomplete, as they are in any detective novel. Only when all of the consequences of the murder – in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em>, the anxiety that has remained with them – are discussed up until the present is the retroversion complete. Only then has the entire development of the retroversion, from its starting point to its conclusion, been presented. All of the antecedents have thus been completely recalled. This occurs quite frequently in the tradition of beginning <em>in medias res</em>, where the narrative begins in the middle of the fabula and the preceding events are then recalled in their totality. This is a special kind of anachrony: distance and span cover each other precisely; the retroversion ends where it began.</p>
                <p>A classical example of an incomplete anachrony is the retroversion in which the origin of Ulysses’s scar is explained in the nineteenth book of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Odyssey</em>. When Ulysses, still incognito, appears in his own house and the servant who had nursed him when he was a baby washes his feet according to the custom of hospitality, she recognizes him by his scar. She begins to cry out for joy, but Ulysses stops her. At that moment, the story is interrupted by a lengthy explanation of how the young Ulysses came by the scar. After this extensive retroversion, the chronological narrative is resumed; Ulysses is still trying to silence his servant. The distance of this retroversion is many years; the span is a few days – the infliction of the wound and its healing.</p>
                <p>There is yet another way of considering anachronies in terms of their spans: by distinguishing between <em>punctual</em> and <em>durative</em> anachronies. These terms have been borrowed from the linguistic distinction of the time-aspects of verb tenses. Punctual corresponds to the preterite in English and Spanish, the <em>passé simple</em> in French, and the aorist in Greek. Durative indicates that the action takes longer. In French and Spanish the imperfect is used to indicate a durative aspect; in English this is expressed by the use of the progressive form. Punctual indicates that only one instant from the past or the future is being evoked – the moment the wound was inflicted on Ulysses. Durative means that a somewhat longer period is involved – the days of convalescence that followed.</p>
                <p>Often, a punctual anachrony recalls a brief but significant event; that significance then justifies the anachrony, despite its short span. Durative anachronies tend to sketch a situation that may or may not be the result of an event that is recalled in a punctual anachrony. Sometimes this distinction covers the one between incomplete and complete anachronies, as in example f. The presentation of the marriage between Mary and John is both punctual and incomplete. What follows, the situation of John, who, after the romantic honeymoon period, feels neglected by his ambitious wife, is both durative and complete.</p>
                <p>But durative and complete do not by any means always coincide. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> the memory of the murder is itself a (subjective) punctual retroversion; whereas that of the period following it – the uneasiness and the feeling of guilt, with the doctor’s blackmail– is a (subjective) durative but incomplete retroversion. These possibilities can characterize the author’s narrative style and may even give insight into his or her view of life. Frequent use of punctual anachrony sometimes makes for a bare, informative style; systematic combinations of punctual and durative retroversions can create – or at least add to – the impression that the story is developing according to clear, causative laws: a certain event causes a situation to emerge that makes another event possible, and so on. When durative retroversions are dominant, the reader quickly gets the impression that nothing particularly spectacular is happening. The narrative appears to be a succession of inevitable situations.</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">À la recherche du temps perdu</em>, Proust makes especially powerful use of the possibilities offered by these two forms. Quite frequently he begins a retroversion in a punctual manner, writing something like “<span>This reminded me of the day I entered ...</span>” and then develops the retroversion at such length that it ends up as a durative, almost descriptive passage. The opposite also happens with great frequency in the same novel: a durative retroversion (“<span>I used to visit my aunt every Sunday</span>”) gets fleshed out in such detail that it becomes inevitably punctual. The detailed account makes it simply too hard to believe that such events all happened every Sunday. In this risky play with time, Proust announces the postmodernist experimental novel half a century beforehand, while also honouring Flaubert’s opening passage. The tone for this is set at the very beginning of the book with its famous opening line, “<span>Longtemps je me suis couche bonne heure</span>” (For a long time I used to go to bed early).</p>
                <p>In the novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Migas de pan</em> (2013) by the Colombian writer of Polish Jewish descent Azriel Bibliowicz, the author stages a situation that never gets resolved. Columbian guerrillas have captured Josue, the father of the main character and a Holocaust survivor. The entire novel is structured around the horrible repetition of the violent capturing, decades later. It is clear that Josue has been profoundly traumatized by his camp experience, and now his son Samuel and his other relatives, as they wait to hear from the captors, imagine what must be going through Josue’s head. Their own waiting becomes the experience of powerlessness that their father had gone through decades earlier. This repetitiveness – a tragedy without crisis – becomes the primary story line. Early in the novel, the narrator interprets for the characters what is happening, and it is all about the time span:</p>
                <blockquote>g Con el paso de los dias, la repeticion, la duplicacion de los movimientos, la desesperanza encarnaban el triunfo de la impotencia. Desde el momento en que se llevaron a Josue y recibieron la primera llamada transcurrieron tres largas semanas.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>With the passing of days, the repetition, the duplication of movements, the despair incarnated the triumph of powerlessness. From the moment they took Josue and they received the first call, they went through three long weeks. (24)</blockquote>
                <p>The retroversion is clearly measured: three weeks. But the substance of that stretch of time is qualified (“<span>long weeks</span>”).</p>
                <p>Soon after, Samuel’s experience of time changes. It comes to be ruled by anticipation, but owing to the unpredictability of what he is expecting, the span of the anticipation is so undetermined that it takes on a torturous quality. The anticipation of a phone call becomes the new way in which time, its duration, affects him:</p>
                <blockquote>Para Samuel la palabra espera comenzo a cobrar un nuevo significado: se aferraba a une llamada, a una senal que interrumpia la realidad.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>For Samuel the word waiting took on a new meaning: it clung to a phone call, a signal that would interrupt reality. (25)</blockquote>
                <p>The son becomes aware of the strange fact that his father’s obsession with time is contaminating him, whereas before he had never given that dimension much thought. Now he realizes that his father’s musealization of the family home, consisting of cabinets, each devoted to specific themes, is anchored in the old man’s experience of being locked up in indefinite time. When the span of the present is without end, it becomes a locked room – which is precisely how Josue has organized the house. The transfer of this obsession from father to son does not happen on the sole basis of the <em>postmemory</em> that circulates in families of traumatized people (i.e., children hear of or feel the experiences of their parents without having been there themselves and thereby instead suffer from secondary trauma). Instead, that transfer is now happening due to the son’s experience of being inside a repetition of what he never experienced.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Anticipations</em></strong></p>
                <p>Everything I have discussed so far concerning anachrony is, in principle, applicable both to retroversions and to anticipations. Anticipations are mostly restricted to a single, covert allusion to the outcome of the fabula – an outcome that one must know in order to recognize the anticipations for what they are. They may serve to generate tension or to express a fatalistic vision of life. One more or less traditional form of anticipation is the opening summary. The rest of the story explains the outcome presented at the beginning. This type of anticipation can suggest a sense of fatalism, or predestination: nothing can be done, we can only watch the progression towards the final result, in the hope that next time we recognize the handwriting on the wall. This type robs the narrative of suspense. The suspense generated by the question “<span>How is it going to end?</span>” disappears; we already know.</p>
                <p>However, another kind of suspense – or rather a tension that keeps the reader engaged – may take its place, prompting questions like “<span>How could it have happened like this?</span>”, with such variants as “<span>How could the hero(ine) have been so stupid?</span>” or “<span>How could society allow such a thing to happen?</span>” or “<span>How did the hero(ine) find out about this?</span>”, and so on, according to the direction in which the genre’s conventions steer the reader. Narratives with a CN (so-called first-person novels) are most suitable for references to the future. A narrative whose narrator claims to be presenting his own past can easily contain allusions to the future, which, in relation to the story-time, is the present or may even already be the past. A sentence like</p>
                <p>h Little could I then suspect that ten years later I would again run into the man who is now my husband.</p>
                <p>contains such an anticipation. In relation to the time of the fabula (“<span>then</span>”) this sentence is an anticipation (“<span>ten years later</span>”), but in relation to the story-time (“<span>now</span>”) it is a retroversion, although the distance of the retroversion is smaller than that of the retroversion in which, in the form of an anticipation, it has been embedded. Whether such a sentence is regarded as an anticipation or as a retroversion is of little importance; what matters is both the fact that there are three distinct moments involved, and the question of how they are related to one another. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em>, Cecile’s visit to Paris is constantly being evoked. By the end of the story we still do not know whether that visit will ever take place. That uncertainty fits in with the overall defensiveness of the man who is running away from the situation and who does not really want to know it. The allusions to Cecile’s moving house, all subjective anticipations, cannot be classified as internal or external, although they appear to me to be internal.</p>
                <p>Implicit hints and overt announcements abound in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em>. Sometimes these challenge their own readability. During the scene of the Ball at La Vaubyessard Castle – a key scene in that this is Emma’s last hope of a life of glamour – there is a reiterated mention of white powder sugar. This detail could be set down as an “<span>effect of the real</span>” a la Barthes. But if we consider the current knowledge about the damage sugar can do to our health, it becomes a hint that predicts Emma’s suicide by arsenic – also a white powder. Once picked up, it turns out there are many more hints, especially in that scene but in fact all through the novel. These hints make the novel less realist and move it in the direction of (post)modernism.</p>
                <p>Anticipations, too, can be grouped as internal or external, and here, too, uncertainty can be effectful. Internal anticipations frequently complement a future ellipsis or paralipsis: things are made clear now so that later on they can be skipped or only mentioned in passing. Conversely, such anticipations may have a connecting or an accentuating function when they constitute nothing more than the marker “<span>I shall be coming back to this</span>”. Such is the case in this book, for instance, whenever I am compelled to touch briefly upon a subject that I discuss in detail later.</p>
                <p>A highly effective use of anticipation is the so-called iterative anticipation. In an iterative anticipation an event is presented as the first in a series. Such anticipations often begin in the following way:</p>
                <p>i Then the President appeared on the screen, a spectacle that would weigh on our spirits every Friday from now on.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, the spectacle in question is presented in full detail, and the reader is to view each particularity as an example of something that will occur again and again in the future. The more detailed such a report, the less credible its iterative character, for it is unlikely that the same actions could be performed in exactly the same way every week, right down to the smallest detail.</p>
                <p>In such a case, one is apt to forget quickly that the event was the first of a series, and with its iterative character its anticipatory aspect dissolves. One obvious advantage of this form is that it offers a good opportunity for showing the scene through the eyes of an inquisitive newcomer, which makes its detailed character immediately more plausible. Precisely this combination of iterativity and the uniqueness of the first time gives this form its special possibilities. As I mentioned, Proust makes frequent use of this figure.</p>
                <p>A novel that has already been discussed in this book, Duras’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’aprèsmidi de Monsieur Andesmas</em>, is constructed for the most part around the tension between the promise, made just before the beginning of the fabula, and the fulfilment of that promise, just after the end of the fabula. Both the anticipation of the promised return of Monsieur Andesmas’s daughter and the uncertainty concerning the distance of that anticipation determine the importance of the events in the story, events that ultimately consist of various phases of waiting. This temporal play produces an emotional suspense that is the very stuff of this novel.</p>
                <p>For some anticipations, the realization is certain, for others, it is not. This distinction undergoes adaptation, however, when the terms <em>announcement</em> and <em>hint</em> are employed. Announcements are explicit. Attention is drawn to the fact that we are now concerned with something that will take place only later on. Adverbs such as “<span>later</span>” and verbs such as “<span>expect</span>” or “<span>promise</span>” are used in the text or may be logically added to it. Hints, in contrast, are implicit. A hint is simply a germ, of which the germinating force can only be seen later. The clues in a detective novel function primarily as hints. In such cases, a good story takes care to keep the knowledge from the reader, to prevent the understanding that these hints are anticipations; otherwise, the puzzle will be solved prematurely. On the other hand, it must remain possible for the attentive reader to glimpse their anticipatory nature. It is this possibility that initiates the game between story and reader.</p>
                <p>Announcements work against suspense; hints increase it, because the trained readers of detective fiction will be asking themselves constantly whether a certain detail is an anticipation or not. This curiosity can then be manipulated by means of false hints: details that create the suggestion of being clues but turn out to have been only details after all. A good example of the above is offered in Hawthorne’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Blithedale Romance</em> (1852). There, the impulses are often not really false, but turn out to be irrelevant.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Achrony</em></strong></p>
                <p>In the preceding sections I have assumed that it is possible to determine the direction, the distance, and the span of a deviation in chronology. Sometimes, however, although we may see clearly that we are dealing with a deviation, either the information cannot be sorted out or there is too little of it to define the deviation further. I call such a deviation an <em>achrony</em>, a deviation of time that cannot be analysed any further.</p>
                <p>Various kinds of deviations resembling achrony occur. The anticipationwithin- retroversion – that is, referring forward within a back-reference – has already been mentioned. This form does not always lead to achrony. Example f seems clearly an anticipation from within a retroversion, which together form a complex and complete second-degree retroversion. However, when an anticipation from within a retroversion brings us back once again into the present, direction is no longer relevant. If a continuation of f were to read:</p>
                <p>j When she asked me to marry her, she promised she would be home every evening, that she would have a lot of time for me.</p>
                <p>a future that would have to be the present is being evoked from within the past. This expected present stands in shrill contrast to the realized present: instead of running home after work, Mary calls more and more often to say that urgent business will keep her a few more hours ...</p>
                <p>As far as the passing of time is concerned, the situation predicted in j should have been realized by now. But reality has turned out differently, as if to give the lie to overconfidence in anticipations. Such an anticipation-within-retroversion, which verges on achrony, can effectuate a confrontation between an expected and a realized present. In that capacity it may even contribute to an implied meta-narrative commentary, for example, by emphasizing the fictionality of the fabula.</p>
                <p>A second possibility is the opposite form, the retroversion-withinanticipation. This occurs, for instance, when we are told beforehand how circumstances in the present will be presented to us. The meaning of an event can only be made known later, and the coming of that revelation is announced “<span>now</span>”:</p>
                <p>k Later, John would understand that he had wrongly interpreted Mary’s absence.</p>
                <p>The revelation of John’s mistake will come later, but “<span>now</span>” it is being foreshadowed. At the moment of revelation, reference is made to a mistake made in the past; but in relation to the future, that past is the present evoked by means of a retroversion-within-anticipation.</p>
                <p>A third anachrony that comes close to achrony occurs when an anticipation in relation to the fabula turns out to be a retroversion in the story. An event that has yet to take place chronologically has already been presented – for example, in embedded speech, in the story. Then an allusion is made to it that is an anticipation with respect to the fabula, but a retroversion with respect to the story (Later John understood that ...).</p>
                <p>In addition to these three forms, which are difficult to pinpoint because of their complex structure and, consequently, because they come close to achronies, there are two more possibilities for definite achrony – that is, deviations that are impossible to analyse because of lack of information. To begin with, an achrony is sometimes undated, when it does not indicate anything about its direction, distance, or span. One example:</p>
                <p>l I have never seen him without his wig.</p>
                <p>Here a relationship of sorts with the past is given. In a pinch, this sentence could be seen as a complete retroversion of indeterminate distance. In fact, however, nothing indicates whether the span is restricted to the past or not; in any case, it includes the present if nothing establishes that the situation has come to an end. A second possibility lies in the grouping of events on the grounds of other than chronological criteria, without any mention of chronological sequence.</p>
                <p>Proust sometimes presents a whole series of events, all of which have occurred in the same place. Spatial connections thus replace chronological ones. This is a significant feature of Proust’s narrative style that cannot easily be analysed on the level of either the text or the fabula. Proust, like other modernists such as Virginia Woolf, makes his story particularly visual. If such a series were to be constructed solely according to spatial or any other criteria such as association, for instance, the text would no longer fit my definition of narrative. But if such a series occurs in a narrative in which chronological connections are indicated everywhere else, we are dealing with an achrony. With this last form of achrony we have exhausted the possibilities for structuring the chronological flow within a story into a specific sequence. Here, the linearity of the fabula and the linearity of its presentation to the reader no longer have any correspondence at all.</p>
                <p>In the section titled “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Span</span>” I mentioned the Colombian novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Migas de pan</em> by Azriel Bibliowicz. There, the repetition of capture, first by the Nazis, now by the <em>guerilleros</em>, triggered the son Samuel’s “<span>contamination</span>” by his father’s trauma. In this novel, the specific temporality of trauma is the central issue, thinly disguised by a form of suspense that makes us wonder whether Josue is going to be released “<span>during</span>” the novel, so as to ensure a happy ending. However, given the topic – the Holocaust, the repetition of the captivity and the subsequent disempowerment that is its central cruelty – a happy ending is not to be expected. Nor is there an unhappy ending; we don’t hear that the captive has been found murdered. The lack of an ending that would satisfy our traditional sense of an ending is the key to the novel as a whole and to its resistance against traditional conceptions of time as specifically linear. This is why achrony is its central trope. Speaking of his mother, Samuel – who shares the narratorial function with an external narrator – says the following: “<span>El Holocausto dividio sus mundos y congelo el tiempo de sus vidas</span>”. (The Holocaust divided her worlds and froze the time of her lives, 49). The key word is “<span>congelo</span>” (froze), but more important is the use of the plural of “<span>mundos</span>” (worlds) and “<span>vidas</span>” (lives).</p>
                <p>“<span>El tiempo</span>”, time, remains in the singular as the reigning dimension. It has the power to break up a life into lives, a world into worlds, because it refuses to continue. And Samuel, the son, realizes that he is trapped by his parents’ trauma:</p>
                <blockquote>No habia nada que hacer: yo era hijo del Holocausto, aun cuando no lo hubiese padecido, era une sombra, una sombra larga que me acompanaba y de la que no lograba desprenderme. Era parte de mi piel.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>There was nothing to be done about it: I was a son of the Holocaust, although I had not suffered / undergone / experienced it, it was a shadow, a large shadow that accompanied me and of which I didn’t manage to get rid. It was part of my skin. (49–50)</blockquote>
                <p>And although the larger part of the novel is devoted to a description of the different cabinets in the house in which Josue had tried to preserve the history of humanity, it is the deep sense of time itself that is the subject of his spatial arrangements. Apropos of Noah, and of Utnapishtim, a similar hero in the Gilgamesh <em>epos</em>, Josue had said to his children that “<span>tuvieron que darle tiempo al tiempo para que las aguas se retiran</span>” (they had to give time to time, so that the waters could recede, 65). The novel is replete with reflections on and experiences of the slow pace of time in times of captivity. And as this son suggests, trauma, including the trauma of the generation before the present, is a form of captivity. This has a strong impact on the rhythm of the novel.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">4: Rhythm</h3>
                <p><strong><em>Background</em></strong></p>
                <p>Rhythm is as striking as it is elusive. Narrative media, especially film, work with rhythm, yet the analysis of it has not been successful. The notion seems better suited for poetry and music. In 1921 Percy Lubbock published his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Craft of Fiction</em>, in which he distinguished between a summarizing, accelerating presentation and a broad, scenic one. Twenty years later in Germany, Gunther Muller wrote a number of extensive studies on this subject (1968). Students applied Muller’s principles to a large number of texts. But what is narrative rhythm? What are we to take as a measure of the speed of presentation, the rhythm? Let’s assume that it is possible to calculate, at least approximately, the time covered by the events. The problem is with what kind of time this time of the fabula should be compared.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, we can estimate the speed with which the various events are presented. Just as speed in traffic is gauged by juxtaposing the amount of time involved with the distance covered (she is doing 60: she is travelling 60 kilometres in one hour), so too the amount of time covered by the fabula can be juxtaposed with the amount of space in the text that each event requires: the number of pages, lines, or words. Every analysis is continuously preoccupied with demonstrating its own relevance; there is no point in initiating a detailed calculation of temporal relationships unless some relevance can be predicted. Hence, such an analysis should not simply aim at the precise calculation of the number of words or lines per event; the amount of text set aside for each event only indicates something about how the attention is <em>patterned</em>. The attention paid to the various elements gives us a picture of the vision on the fabula communicated to the reader. The attention paid to each element can only be analysed in relation to the attention for the other elements.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Overall Rhythm</em></strong></p>
                <p>Once we have a rough idea of the amount of time covered by the various events or series of events, episodes, it becomes possible to use this to determine the general rhythm. Let us take as an example a complete life-story of the kind frequently written in the nineteenth century. The fabula contains the birth of the hero, his childhood, adolescence, military service, first love, the period of social ambition, decline, and death. It is possible to determine the number of pages devoted to each episode. Often, this simple exercise alone will make clear that certain episodes are given more attention than others. Childhood, for instance, is often summarized quickly, while first love is dwelt upon in much more detail. On the other hand, the novel may also reflect an even division of attention. In Dickens’ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dombey and Son</em>, for instance, the story begins with the birth of Paul Dombey. At that time, his father is forty-eight years old. After approximately one-third of the story Paul dies, at about the age of twelve. The story continues until Dombey’s old age, so that, as far as rhythm is concerned, Paul’s death takes place “<span>at the right moment</span>”, for Dombey then has twenty-odd more years to live.</p>
                <p>Whether or not the attention is spread more or less evenly across the fabula, there will always be an alternation of sorts between extensive and summarizing presentation. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Craft of Fiction</em>, Percy Lubbock distinguished between these two forms, the scene and the summary. It has been noted that this relative contrast should be pushed to its limit. On the one hand, we can distinguish the <em>ellipsis</em>, an omission in the story of a section of the fabula. When a certain part of the time covered by the fabula is given absolutely no attention at all, the amount of TF (time of the fabula) is infinitely larger than the TS (story-time). On the other hand, we can distinguish the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pause</em>, when an element that takes no fabula-time (hence, an object, not a process) is presented in detail. TF is then infinitely smaller than TS. This is the case in descriptive or argumentative fragments.</p>
                <p>Both <em class="notranslate" translate="no">summary</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">slow-down</em> are to be viewed relatively, in relation to each other. The easiest way to set up such a comparison is to establish a kind of norm tempo, a zero-line. Real <em>isochrony</em>, a complete coincidence of TF and TS, cannot occur in language. We can, however, assume that a dialogue without commentary takes as long in TF as it does in TS. The dialogue, and in principle every scene, every detailed presentation of an event with a claim to isochrony, thus functions as a point of comparison. By scene I here mean a segment of text in which TF = TS. In total, five different tempi would thus become distinguishable:</p>
                <p>Ellipsis TF = n TS = O thus TF &gt; ∞ TS</p>
                <p>Summary TF &gt; TS</p>
                <p>Scene TF &lt; = TS</p>
                <p>Slow-down TF &lt; TS</p>
                <p>Pause TF = O TS = n thus TF &lt; ∞ TS</p>
                <p>Here &gt; means longer than</p>
                <p>&lt; means shorter than</p>
                <p>∞ means infinite</p>
                <p>= means is ± equal</p>
                <p>Every narrative can be divided into segments corresponding to one of these five tempi. In the following sections I discuss some characteristics of each tempo.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Ellipsis</em></strong></p>
                <p>An ellipsis cannot be perceived: according to the definition, nothing is indicated in the story about the amount of fabula-time involved. If nothing is indicated, we cannot know what would have been indicated. All we can do is logically deduce that something has been omitted. Note that this kind of deduction is based on a realistic reading, which may be predominant but is not always meaningful. That which has been omitted – the contents of the ellipsis – need not be unimportant; on the contrary, the event about which nothing is said may have been so painful that it is being elided for precisely that reason, an example being the conception of Madame Bovary’s child. Or the event is so difficult to put into words that it is preferable to maintain complete silence about it. Another possibility, already mentioned, is the situation in which the actor wants to deny that an event has taken place. By keeping silent about it, he attempts to undo it. Here the ellipsis is being used for magical purposes, as an exorcism. This reading of the ellipsis is central in Robbe-Grillet’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le voyeur</em>, a postmodern mystery novel from 1955.</p>
                <p>How are we to become aware of these ellipses, which can, apparently, be so important that it seems worth the trouble to look for them? To begin with, our attention is sometimes directed towards an elided event because of a retroversion. We know that something must have happened, and sometimes we know approximately where, but it is difficult to indicate the exact location.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, however, an ellipsis is indicated. Mention is made of the time that has been skipped. If a text reads:</p>
                <p>a When I was back in New York after two years …</p>
                <p>we know exactly how much time has been left out. It is even clearer when an ellipsis is mentioned in a separate sentence:</p>
                <p>b Two years passed.</p>
                <p>In fact, this is no longer an ellipsis, but could be called a minimal summary, or rather, a summary with maximum speed: two years in one sentence. Such a pseudo-ellipsis, or mini-summary, can be expanded with a brief specification concerning its contents:</p>
                <p>c Two years of bitter poverty passed.</p>
                <p>The pseudo-ellipsis is beginning to look more and more like a summary. Whether we still regard the next sentence as a pseudo-ellipsis or whether we now label it a summary depends on what the overall rhythm of the story is, or simply how far we wish to go: the borderline between these two tempi is flexible.</p>
                <p>d Two years of bitter poverty passed, in which she lost two children, became unemployed, and was evicted from her home because she could not pay the rent.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></p>
                <p>In example c the specification of content indicated a situation. None of the events of those two elided years are mentioned, even though according to the realistic reading game, it is unlikely that no events took place at all. In d, however, various events are presented – at least three, but probably four or more. Let’s say that the children died one after the other and that loss then counts as two events. The unpaid rent implies a good many events, such as the landlord’s visits, the woman’s desperation and its expression, her attempts to find money and the failure of those attempts. The woman is evicted. What then? At that moment in the fabula, the situation changes. Consequently, the rhythm of the narrative changes. A slower tempo is adopted, the next event – a meeting? an inheritance? a discovery? – must alter the situation radically. Consequently, this key event receives all the attention.</p>
                <p>So-called dramatic climaxes are events that have a strong influence on the course of the fabula – they are its turning points, moments at which a situation changes, a line is broken. Such events are presented extensively in scenes, whereas insignificant events – insignificant in the sense that they do not greatly influence the course of the fabula – are quickly summarized. This can be phrased the other way around: it is because they get more narrative time that events take on major importance. The opening of Dickens’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oliver Twist</em>, a classical example of a realistic novel, exhibits something like this rhythm. Oliver’s birth is presented extensively: three pages. Then, at the age of nine months, the hero is sent to a charitable institution. The situation there is sketched in a page and a half, and suddenly Oliver is nine and is taken away three pages.</p>
                <p>The rhythm of Flaubert’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em> is very different. Many events that one could expect to have been presented as dramatic climaxes, are summarized rapidly, whereas routine events – for instance, situations that recur every week – are presented extensively. This reversal of the traditional rhythm is very well suited to a fabula that reflects boredom, the emptiness of a person’s existence. In this sense the novel is realistic; rhythm matches content. But the reversal of the expected rhythm can also initiate reflection on the non-realistic poetics of this novel. It can even qualify as (proto-)postmodern as a result. To a great degree, the originality of Flaubert’s work is determined by this doubleedged technique.</p>
                <p>As should be clear, the summary is a suitable instrument for presenting – and, for the reader, gleaning – background information, or for connecting various scenes. The place of the summary in a story depends strongly on the type of fabula involved: a crisis-fabula will require much less summarizing than a developing fabula (see “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Duration</span>”).</p>
                <p><strong><em>Scene</em></strong></p>
                <p>In longer narratives such as novels, scenes predominate. Although traditionally an even alternation between summary and scene used to be the aim, in order not to overtire readers with too rapid a tempo or bore them with one that was too slow, in the course of time a development has made itself felt towards rejection of that stereotypical pattern. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em> the scenes frequently present an event <em>in extenso</em> as an example of a whole series of such events. Every Thursday the heroine goes to Rouen to visit her lover: thus a long scene follows, in which such a visit is presented in detail. The effect of this technique is to dull the newness of the event, to indicate that daily routine has once again re-established itself in Emma’s life, at exactly that moment that was intended to demonstrate her efforts to break out of that routine. A hopeless enterprise, we therefore conclude. Proust, who was greatly (albeit ambivalently) inspired by Flaubert, also showed a preference for scenes. But in his work they function differently. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">À la recherche du temps perdu</em> scenes are often the first in a series of similar scenes. This transforms them into anticipations. In these instances, the intensity of the sensations of a first time justifies the lavishness of the presentation.</p>
                <p>In a scene the duration of the fabula and that of the story are roughly the same. Roughly, because most scenes are full of retroversions, anticipations, non-narrative fragments such as general observations, or atemporal sections such as descriptions. A truly synchronic scene, in which the duration of the fabula coincided completely with that of the presentation in the story, would be unreadable. The dead moments in a conversation, the nonsensical or unfinished remarks, are omitted. In the eighteenth century, Sterne’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tristram Shandy</em> (1767) explored and mocked the impossibility of describing real time. Even a writer who tries to give precisely these aspects of a conversation their due – Marguerite Duras, for example – is forced to abridge them considerably, on penance of unreadability.</p>
                <p>A writer who wishes to fill out a scene will automatically employ more attention-grabbing material – which can also serve to connect the preceding and the following chapters. Thus a scene is often a central moment from which the narrative can proceed in any direction. In such cases the scene is actually anti-linear. The coincidence of TF and TS is then no more than appearance.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Slow-Down</em></strong></p>
                <p>Slow-down stands in direct contrast to the summary. In practice this tempo occurs very rarely. It is difficult if not impossible to achieve synchrony in a scene because the presentation is soon experienced as too slow. Still, the theoretical possibility of this tempo cannot be ignored. Although it is, in general, set aside for use in small sections of the narrative only, it can nevertheless have an extremely evocative effect. At moments of great suspense, slow-down may work like a magnifying glass.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, a brief slowing down occurs within a scene, in such cases often reinforced by, for instance, a subjective retroversion. Imagine the arrival of a visitor or a letter. In the short time between the ringing of the bell and the opening of the door, the actor is bombarded by all sorts of thoughts, his nerves are taut – a whole life passes through his mind, and it takes pages before he actually opens the door. Rare as they may be, some slow-down passages rank among the classic scenes in world literature.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Pause</em></strong></p>
                <p>Pauses occur much more frequently. This term includes all narrative sections in which no movement of the fabula-time is implied. A great deal of attention is paid to one element, and in the meantime the fabula remains stationary. When it continues later on, no time has passed. Here we are dealing with a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pause</em>. Pause has a strongly retarding effect; yet the reader easily forgets that the fabula has been stopped, whereas in a slow-down our attention is directed towards the fact that the passage of time has slowed down.</p>
                <p>In various periods of literary history, different opinions have been held about pauses. In Homer, pauses are avoided. Often descriptions of objects are replaced by retroversions, which also have a slowing-down effect, but still replace the broken line of time by another temporal sequence. This is the case during the explanation of Ulysses’s scar by which his old nurse recognizes him on his return. The shield of Achilles is described in retroversion, while it is being made, thus becoming a case of description motivated on the level of the fabula. Similarly, Agamemnon’s armour is described while he is putting it on, so that we can no longer refer to an interruption, but to a scene.</p>
                <p>During the era of Naturalism, the pause was less of a problem; the explicit goal of these novels was to sketch a picture of reality. To do that, a good many object descriptions were necessary, while the flow of the fabula-time was of secondary importance. Lengthy descriptive sections and, to a lesser extent, generalized argumentative expositions are certainly not exceptions in the novels of this period. The pause was an accepted tempo. And when such descriptions led to excessively long interruptions of the fabula, their presence was justified by tying them to the vision of an onlooker.</p>
                <p>Post-Naturalist novelists adopted this last solution. Whenever a long description had to be inserted, they made sure that the seam was hidden. In Zola’s novels, this takes the following form. An actor looks at an object, and what s/he sees is described. The passing of a certain amount of time is thus implied, so that such descriptions do not constitute a real pause, but a scene. That flow of time is indicated by means of a verb of perception – usually <em>to see –</em> supported, in many cases, by adverbs of time: <em>first, subsequently</em>, and <em>then finally</em> all suggest the passing of time, even if everything else indicates that there can hardly be any passing time. The pause is thus concealed.</p>
                <p>In modernist narrative the pause is frankly adopted. Many novels by Virginia Woolf, to mention one of the best-known cases, alternate the presentation of slow, unimportant events with lengthy descriptive passages. The difference between the presentation of events and the description of objects is often hard to make out, so that the entire story moves on like a long descriptive flow. The exploration of the nuances of perception is characteristic of modernist narrative. With postmodernism, the question of narrative rhythm along these lines loses its meaning altogether.</p>
                <p>In spite of the difficulty of grasping different narrative tempi and making statements about rhythm, then, this concept is important because for all its lack of precision it is helpful in characterizing different modes of narrative <em>historically</em>. The question of the delimitation and definition of descriptive and argumentative sections as opposed to narrative sections was discussed in the previous chapter. Here it is relevant only to note that such sections disrupt the flow of time and function, therefore, as pauses.</p>
                <p>In short: the tools of narrative to vary its overall rhythm are the figures of ellipsis, the elision of events we expect, summary, the quick enumeration of events that take a much longer time, and its opposite, the scene that spins out a single event over a relatively long stretch of text, and the slow-down that stretches time beyond simultaneity. The paradox of narrative, in this respect, is the use of scenes as building blocks in the face of chronology, the linearity that suggests a complete rendering of the sequence of events while such completeness would make the narrative unbearably slow.</p>
                <p>A very clear example of this paradox <em class="notranslate" translate="no">is L’étranger</em> by Albert Camus (1942). This novel, in which chronological sequence is maintained, consists almost entirely of scenes. These scenes cannot possibly coincide completely with the time of the fabula. After all, the latter covers quite a few days. In fact, they are pseudo-scenes, scenes that are presented in a strongly accelerated manner, with myriad invisible ellipses. This lack of synchrony is even explicitly indicated, as Meursault, the protagonist, regularly consults his watch to ascertain that it is, again, much later. The same thing happens in the Dutch novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Evenings</em>, contemporary with Camus’s novel. The scenes, usually slow-paced, in these novels are used to indicate the rapidity of time together with the immeasurable emptiness in spending it. This gives the suggestion of too little time reflected in an excess of time. The scene is the most appropriate form to do so.</p>
                <p>This is the case, for instance, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’après-midi de Monsieur Andesmas</em> where at the end, a few seconds of the fabula span pages. The occasion is the long-awaited arrival of Monsieur Andesmas’s daughter. The girl’s voice, her footsteps, can all be heard, and still it takes a terribly long time before she actually appears. This last event we are not even allowed to see. As if to indicate that her late arrival is definitely too late for her father, as proof that he has lost her, the arrival itself is not presented at all. It occurs outside the story and outside the fabula. The fabula of the novel spans the time from just after her departure to just before her return.</p>
                <p>Rare as they may be, moments of slow-down rank among the great passages of world literature. One such passage is the first kiss that Marcel, the protagonist of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">À la recherche</em>, bestows on Albertine, the object of his obsessive love, repulsion, jealousy, and possessiveness alternatively. This passage is remarkable for a great number of reasons, one of which is its insistence on the difficulties of seeing. The kiss becomes the crucial example of the impossibility of seeing:</p>
                <blockquote>Suddenly my eyes ceased to see, then my nose, crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any odour, and, without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire, I learned, from these obnoxious signs, that at last I was in the act of kissing Albertine’s cheek. (2.378)</blockquote>
                <p>This impossibility, which seems here to be absolute, is the culmination of a whole development, stretched out in time; of an entire “<span>study</span>” of the sensorial imperfection of the body and, in particular, of the lips as a tool for gaining knowledge, a true epistemological instrument. The difficulties that intervene are of various orders: the perception is displaced, the object is transformed, and the skin as a surface breaks up into “<span>coarse grain</span>”:</p>
                <blockquote>At first, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had recommended it to kiss, my eyes, in changing position, saw a different pair of cheeks; the neck, observed at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass, showed in its coarser grain a robustness which modified the character of the face. (2.378)</blockquote>
                <p>The slow-down is necessary because instead of the act of kissing itself – the relevant element in the fabula – it is the nuances of perception that accompany it that the narrator is describing.</p>
                <p>The story overrules the fabula here. And those nuances are too complex to be presented in scenic simultaneity. An entire drama of vision inserts itself between fabula and story. For the magnifying glass does not improve close-up vision – it modifies it. The object seen is a different one, and this difference continues until the perception is reduced to nothing. The lens allows too much to be seen. But this operation nonetheless functions by splitting the vision into multiple elements. All these elements are so detailed that presenting them takes more time than a simple kiss. What ultimately happens here, as often in Proust, is that the fabula disappears under the weight of the story so that a miniature new fabula appears to insert itself, pushing the banality of events away and replacing it with the exciting discovery of what is hardly perceptible. The difference between the presentation of events and the description of objects is often hard to make out, with the result that the entire story moves along in a long descriptive flow.</p>
                <p>The following passage from Virginia Woolf’s novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Waves</em> (1931) bears this subtle movement out:</p>
                <blockquote>And then tiring of pursuit and flight, lovelily they [the birds] came descending, delicately declining, dropped down and sat silent on the tree, on the wall, with their bright eyes glancing, and their heads turned this way, that way; aware, awake; intensely conscious of one thing, one object in particular.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Perhaps it was a snail shell, rising in the grass like a grey cathedral, a swelling building burnt with dark rings and shadowed green by the grass. Or perhaps they saw the splendour of the flowers making a light of flowing purple over the beds, through which dark tunnels of purple shade were driven between the stalks. (53)</blockquote>
                <p>The presentation of a minuscule event – the descent, then rest of the birds – progresses into a description of the birds sitting on their respective perches. As in the Proust passage of the kiss, the fabula is snowed under by an account of an act of perception. The rhythm is slow, but whether the stillness that results is a pause in the fabula or, on the contrary, completely covers the fabula-time of the act of perception, cannot be made out. Duration is the backdrop against which these nuances of perception are being explored.</p>
                <p>With postmodernism, the question of narrative rhythm along these lines loses its meaning altogether. In her novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood and Guts in High School</em> (1978), Kathy Acker seems to mock any attempt to establish temporal equivalences between story-time and fabula-time. This does not mean that the story has no narrative rhythm. On the contrary, it seems hasty and fragmented, frantic, and, as a result, verging on incoherent. It is by disrupting the correlation between fabula and story in this respect that the novel achieves its postmodern “<span>feel</span>”. Here are a few passages to get a sense of this. The first, about a character, Janey, who works in a hippy East Village bakery, shows how Janey has to “<span>forget</span>” her self in order to be able to work. In the workplace she is addressed as a function, not as a person. She tersely verbalizes this lack of self that comes with being a labourer in a phrase that sounds like a reversal of Descartes’s famous dictum “<span>I think therefore I am</span>”: “<span>I am nobody because I work</span>” (37). Later she explains this condition of being nobody when working:</p>
                <blockquote>I had to do all the counter work. My father stopped sending me money. I had to work seven days a week. I had no more feelings. I was no longer a real person. If I stopped work just for a second, I would hate. Burst through the wall and hate. Hatred that comes out like that can be a bomb.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I hated most that I didn’t have any more dreams or visions. It’s not that the vision-world, the world of passion and wildness, no longer existed. It always is. But awake I was disconnected from dreams. I was psychotic. (40)</blockquote>
                <p>As one critic wrote: “<span>When Janey tells about the abortions in her life, she immediately makes clear that they should not be seen as dramatic moments in a life story. She tells about her abortions because they have for her symbolic value</span>”. This critic cites the following two passages:</p>
                <blockquote>I’m not trying to tell you about the rotgut weird parts of my life. Abortions are the symbol, the outer image, of sexual relations in this world. Describing my abortions is the only way I can tell you about pain and fear ... my unstoppable drive for sexual love made me know. (34)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I didn’t know how much these abortions hurt me physically and mentally. I was desperate to fuck more and more so I could finally get love. Soon my total being was on fire, not just my sex, and I was doing everything to make the non-sexual equivalent of love happen. (35)</blockquote>
                <p>The critic comments: “<span>she explicitly tries to prevent the reader from turning the narration of her abortions into a narrative event, that is, into part of a plot</span>” (Van Alphen 1997a).</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">5: Frequency</h3>
                <p>A third aspect often distorts the two aspects of time treated above (i.e., order and rhythm). Gerard Genette labels this aspect <em>frequency</em>. By this he means the numerical relationship between the events in the fabula and those in the story. The phenomenon of <em>repetition</em>, which is the one under discussion here, has always had a paradoxical side. As the example of Borges’s quotation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Don Quixote</em> in his story “<span>Pierre Menard, Author of the Quichote</span>” (1939) demonstrates, even two literally identical texts are not really identical. Similarly, two events are never exactly the same. The first event of a series differs from the one that follows it, if only because it is the first and the other is not. Strictly speaking, the same goes for verbal repetition in a text: only one can be the first. Yet a series such as</p>
                <p>a I went to bed early. I turned in betimes. I was in bed before dark.=</p>
                <p>will be seen as a repetition of one and the same event: the actor went to bed early. Obviously, it is the onlooker, and the readers, who remember the similarities between the events of a series and ignore the differences. When I refer to a repetition, I mean different events – or alternative presentations of events – that show similarities. The most common frequency is the singular presentation of a singular event.</p>
                <p>b She came at length and opened the door to her sister’s importunities. Kate Chopin, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Story of an Hour</span>”, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Portraits</em></p>
                <p>However, a story entirely constructed of such singular presentations would create a highly peculiar and ragged effect. Usually, a combination of this and other possible frequencies is employed.</p>
                <p>A second frequency occurs when an event happens more often and is presented as often as it occurs. Thus, there is repetition on both levels so that, again, we should really term this a singular presentation. This is not the case if the event occurs often and is presented often, but not as often as it occurs. If something happens every day in the course of three months, and it is presented five times, numerical disproportion results. Whether such a frequency creates a strongly repetitive effect or not depends on the nature of the event and on the amount of attention paid to it. The more banal the event, the less striking the repetition: this could serve as a rough guideline. In cinema, convention has it that three occurrences of the same event stand for an endless repetition.</p>
                <p>I refer to a repetition when an event occurs only once but is presented a number of times. Some experimental novels employ this possibility lavishly. Robbe-Grillet’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le voyeur</em> is a case in point. In general, it is used with much more discretion. Moreover, the repetition may be disguised to a certain extent by stylistic variations, as in example a. Sometimes variations in “<span>perspective</span>” (see focalization, below) are also used to justify the repetition: the event may be the same, but each actor views it in his own or her own way. This device was used regularly in the eighteenth-century epistolary novel. Another famous example is Faulkner’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929). Every internal retroversion or anticipation that does not fill in an ellipsis belongs to this frequency. These constitute repetitions of something that has already been mentioned before.</p>
                <p>The reverse of a repetition is an <em>iterative</em> presentation: a whole series of identical events is presented at once. We have already seen examples of this. Flaubert and Proust make systematic use of iteration. Iterative presentation used to be regarded as subordinate to singular presentation. It was employed to sketch a background, against which the singular events were highlighted. Flaubert was the first writer in Western literature to my knowledge to give iteration a dominant position in his work. Proust went even further: his novel consists for the most part of iterative scenes. These are often so extensive that their iterative nature becomes questionable. One visit, supposedly an example of a long series, is described in eighty pages: the conversations, the gestures, the guests, everything is presented in detail. It is no longer credible that such a visit is an example of weekly visits, performed year in year out. This then is a case of pseudo-iteration – a form through which Proust marked his modernist anti-realism.</p>
                <p>There are three forms of iteration. If they are generalizing and are concerned with general facts that also exist outside the fabula, then they come very close to situation-descriptions. The opening of Dickens’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Oliver Twist</em> is a good example: the scene in the poorhouse is an instance of what it was like, in general, in the poorhouses of that time, besides being from the fabula of this poor little boy. One may also highlight events that are related to a specific fabula but that exceed its time span. These we could call external iterations.</p>
                <p>c And yet she had loved him, sometimes. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Story of an Hour</span>”</p>
                <p>This love has sometimes, though not often, been felt, but is mentioned only once. The period lies outside the borders of the fabula, and the iteration could therefore be termed external. It is not generalizing, however, as it concerns this one woman, the woman who is the actor in the fabula. For the sake of quick, efficient notation I have drawn up a formula, according to which these kinds of frequency may be defined:</p>
                <p>– 1f/1s: singular: one event, one presentation</p>
                <p>– nf/ns: plurisingular: various events, various presentations</p>
                <p>– nf/ms: varisingular: various events, various presentations, unequal in number</p>
                <p>– 1f/ns: repetitive: one event, various presentations</p>
                <p>– nf/1s: iterative: various events, one presentation</p>
                <p>Again, iteration functions differently in postmodernist narrative. Acker’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood and Guts</em> also contains the following passage:</p>
                <blockquote>Of course, daddy and Sally and the boys in his band are given their rooms first. My room is the room no one else in the world wants. My bedroom is the huge white hexagon in the front left corner of the hotel. It has no clear outside or inside or any architectural regularity. Long white pipes form part of its ceiling. Two of its sides, which two is always changing, are open.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>My bedroom’s function is also unclear. Its only furniture is two barber’s chairs and a toilet. It’s a gathering place for men.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Hotel men dressed in white and black come in and want to hurt me. They cut away parts of me. I call for the hotel head. He explains that my bedroom used to be the men’s toilet. I understand. My cunt used to be a men’s toilet.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I walk out in a leopard coat. (36)</blockquote>
                <p>The passage appears to begin with a singular event, coated with description. But how often do the “<span>hotel men dressed in white and black</span>” come in? Does the conflation between “<span>my bedroom</span>” and “<span>my cunt</span>” retrospectively turn this event into an iterative one, ironically turning the “<span>explanation</span>” of the hotel head into an indictment of gender relations? This iterative effect is thereby loaded with meaning. The final sentence is totally unclear in terms of frequency.</p>
                <p>Flaubert, as mentioned before, was a master of rhythmic storytelling. By the sheer use of verb forms he managed to predict the entire outcome of an episode, and thus undercut suspense. I remember how struck I was, long ago, when reading the first sentence of chapter 5 of the third part of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em>. Emma has just begun her liaison with Leon. She has plotted a way of seeing him on a weekly basis, with piano lessons as a pretext. “<span>C’etait je jeudi</span>” (it was Thursdays) begins the chapter. Thus, the verb tense indicates routine. The detailed narration of the small events that precede the encounter with her lover, all in the <em>imparfait</em> of routine, are plausible enough as iterations.</p>
                <p>The passage of about a page and a half ends, however, with the following sentence, which in isolation would be considered almost a-grammatical: “<span>Puis, d’un seul coup d’oeil, la ville apparaissait</span>”. (Then, in the blink of an eye, the city appeared / would appear). The suddenness implied in the adverbial clause is contradicted by the tense of routine. Preceding this sentence is a clause that “<span>explains</span>” the apparent contradiction: “<span>… afin de se faire des surprises, elle fermait les yeux</span>”. (… in an attempt to surprise herself she would close her eyes). In self-deception, Emma tries desperately to recover the excitement of a liaison that already, we can surmise, bores her. This is a brilliant example of Flaubert’s mode of predicting the tragic ending by means of subtle indications, all through the novel. No quantitative analysis of rhythm will do justice to this literary art.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Heterochrony</em></strong></p>
                <p>At the end of this discussion of temporality and the various forms it can take in narrative, I feel compelled to briefly indicate how all this technical fussing can be justified as highly relevant. Hence, a short note on what I call <em>heterochrony</em> is in order. Others call it by different names; David Herman, in an analysis of a short story by Anna Seghers, speaks of “<span>polychrony</span>” (2002, 224–32). My choice of the term heterochrony is motivated by the emphasis on difference, rather than multiplicity only. Migration, a much-discussed topic of our time, is the exemplary situation of the experience of time as multiple, heterogeneous. The time of haste and waiting, the time of movement and stagnation; the time of memory and of an unsettling present not sustained by a predictable future. The phenomenon considered from the outside I call <em>multi-temporality</em>; the experience of it, <em>heterochrony</em>. Multi-temporality is a phenomenon that has always existed, but seems overruled by the predominance of measurable, linear time in the organization of social life. Heterochrony is something one can be afflicted by, suffer from. You can “<span>have</span>” heterochrony as you can have the flu. When multi-temporality becomes a problem, an inhibition, and paralysing contradiction, you “<span>have</span>” heterochrony. But it may also lead to a pleasurable sense of fulfilment, when the multiple temporal strands in a day make that day particularly intense or meaningful. Both video as a storytelling medium and migratory culture intensify the experiences of heterochrony.</p>
                <p>Time, in all its internal differentiation, is usually, sometimes forcefully, subjected to one of its aspects only, that of chronology. This linear logic has a profound sensate effect on everyone, and more strongly so on those whose relationship to the local chrono-logic is oblique. Thus conceived, chronology is a stricture that looms over events and thus colours the experience of time with a dark shadow of inadequacy.</p>
                <p>Heterochrony is more than subjective experience, however. It contributes to the temporal texture of our cultural world, and thus to our understanding and experiencing it is a political necessity. This texture is multi-temporal. This trains the viewer to be sensitive to this aspect of temporal disjunction in the lives of people among whom we live. Thus, it is now obvious that analyses of narrative in all its forms, with its capacity to manipulate time in the ways described above, can contribute to an understanding of, and the development of a greater sensitivity to, the multiple ways in which cultural experience engages time.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">6: Characters</h3>
                <p>Narrative – fiction as well as journalism, films, and informal narratives of everyday life – thrives on the affective appeal of characters. Whether we like them or not, we are compelled to read on because we respond to those paper, celluloid, or digital people. In this section I use the term <em>character</em> for the anthropomorphic figures provided with specifying features the narrator tells us about. Their distinctive characteristics together create a character-effect. In the course of this section, the difference between the more specific term <em>character</em> and the general, abstract term <em>actor</em> at issue in the next chapter will gradually become clearer. To begin, more often than not a character resembles a human being and an actor need not necessarily do so. For the moment, let us assume that a character is the effect that occurs when a figure is presented with distinctive, mostly human characteristics. In this view, an actor in the fabula is a structural position, while a character is a complex semantic unit. As readers, we “<span>see</span>” characters, feel with them, and like or dislike them. These characters are only reducible to actors in a process of abstraction.</p>
                <p>On the level of the story, characters differ from one another. In that sense they are individual. On the basis of the characteristics they have been allotted, each of them functions in a different way with respect to the reader. The latter gets to know them more or less than other characters, finds them more or less appealing, identifies more or less easily with them. The aim of this section is not to determine (define) the characters (who are they?), but to characterize them (what are they?, and how do we find out?).</p>
                <p><strong><em>Why Characters Resist Us</em></strong></p>
                <p>Characters resemble people. Literature is written by, for, and about people. That remains a truism, so banal that we often tend to forget it, and so problematic that we as often repress it. On the other hand, the people with whom literature is concerned are not real people. They are fabricated creatures made up from fantasy, imitation, memory. That no satisfying, coherent theory of character is available is due to this anthropomorphic aspect. The character is not a human being, but it resembles one. It has no real psyche, personality, ideology, or competence to act, but it does possess characteristics that make readers assume they do and that make psychological and ideological descriptions possible. Character is intuitively the most crucial category of narrative, and also the one most subject to projection and fallacies.</p>
                <p>It is fair to say that characters do not exist; yet narratives produce <em>character-effects</em>. The character-effect occurs when the resemblance between human beings and fabricated figures is so strong that we forget the fundamental difference: we even go so far as to identify with the character, to cry, to laugh, and to search for or with it – or even against it, when the character is a villain. This is a major attraction of narrative. But it also leads us to ask questions that are frankly irrelevant (“<span>How many children had Lady Macbeth?</span>”) and that reduce the narrative to flat realism. This is a risk, for example, when we identify so much with the characters in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beloved</em> that we absolutely insist on the live, natural status of Beloved or, for the very same reason (the need for clarity), her supernatural status. Attempts to understand characters’ behaviour often inspire psychological criticism where such criticism is clearly not adequate to account for the literary or cinematic qualities of the text.</p>
                <p>The kind of response that judges characters as real, modern, psychologically complex people has had nefarious effects on scholarship. It has produced the myth of primitivism in the scholarship about ancient and folk literature and about geographically and culturally remote literatures. It has also produced a large body of critical literature that, seemingly reiterating the misogyny of the texts studied, projects sexism on texts whose function is not moral at all, or whose standards of representation have nothing to do with what realist literature has taught us to expect. This is a major ideological trap. It is also a literary-historical pitfall, for it obscures the characteristics of modes of storytelling that are far different from those of a modern and Western sensibility. For example, in their efforts to explain events in biblical narratives that seemed incongruous to the modern reader, biblical critics tended to qualify gullible actors as “<span>dumb</span>” or “<span>stupid</span>” characters, and transgressive actors such as Eve in the creation story as wicked characters.</p>
                <p>With a view to overcoming this flattening tendency, I suggest that we restrict our investigation to what is presented to us in the actual words of the text. Rather than producing formalist descriptions, such restraint will produce rewarding surprises, unheard-of possibilities, and innovative social attitudes to emulate. Characters give the most pleasure when they are allowed to resist their readers instead of being overruled and forced to conform to readers’ expectations. Such wiping away of the dust of interpretive traditions makes even millennia-old texts appear shining new. But within the material of the story – the entire mass of information presented to us by the narrating agent – more confusion occurs. When we come across a detailed portrait of a character who has already been mentioned, we are justified in saying that that information – that portrait – “<span>belongs to</span>” the character, that it “<span>creates</span>” the character, maps it out, builds it up. A certain measure of coherence results. But when they rely on the analogy between character and human being, readers tend to attach so much importance to coherence that this material is easily reduced to a psychological portrait that has more bearing on the reader’s own desire to recognize the character than on the interchange between text, story, and fabula. It is crucial to distance oneself from this anthropomorphism. Moreover, a story contains other information that, while connected less directly with a certain character, contributes as much to the image of that character that is offered to the reader. What a figure does is as important as what he or she thinks, feels, remembers, or looks like.</p>
                <p>Another drawback of a certain critical tradition is the division of characters into the kinds of categories that literary criticism is so fond of. E.M. Forster’s 1927 classical distinction between round and flat characters was based on psychological criteria. Round characters are like complex persons, who undergo a change in the course of the story and remain capable of surprising the reader. Flat characters are stable; they are stereotypical, and they exhibit or contain nothing surprising. Even if such classifications were to be moulded into manageable distinctions, they would still only be applicable to the limited corpus of the psychological narrative. Entire genres, such as fairy tales, detective fiction, and popular fiction, but also ancient literature such as biblical or qur’anic stories, as well as modernist novels like Proust’s and postmodern novels that mock precisely such categories, thus remain excluded from observation or aesthetic appreciation because all of their characters are “<span>flat</span>”.</p>
                <p>I am concerned here with establishing a framework for characterizing specific narrative characters, as a way to at least partly explain the character-effect. A summary of the kinds of information the readers have at their disposal in order to construct an image of a character, and a summary of the information they actually use while doing so, should make this possible. But in this discussion even more than in the rest of the concepts offered in this book, it is important to realize that much remains resistant to analysis. And rather than viewing that resistance as a failure of narratological analysis, I emphasize that it is evidence of the success of such an analysis.</p>
                <p>The so-called extra-textual situation creates yet another ambiguity. This concerns the influence of reality on the story, insofar as reality plays a part in it. Even if we do not wish to study the relations between text and context as a separate object of analysis, we cannot ignore the fact that direct or indirect knowledge of the context of certain characters contributes significantly to their meaning. The character President Eisenhower in Coover’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Public Burning</em> (1977) is not the factual president of the United States, Eisenhower as we know him from historical evidence. But the impression we receive of that character depends to a great extent on the confrontation between our own image of Eisenhower and the image the story offers, which in its turn is shaped by another context. The influence of data from reality is all the more difficult to determine since the personal situation, knowledge, background, historical moment, and so on of the reader are involved here.</p>
                <p>Finally, the description of a character is always strongly coloured by the ideology of critics, who are often unaware of their own ideological hang-ups. Consequently, what is presented as a description is an implicit value judgment. And here the realistic tendency promoted by the anthropomorphism of characters can play nasty tricks. Characters are attacked or defended as if they were people that the critics like or dislike. Even worse, author and character are viewed as one and the same. Existentialist criticism tended to do this. Emotions flared at the publication of Nabokov’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lolita</em> (1955). The character Humbert’s mentality was all wrong; the man was an immoral hypocrite, and quotations from the text could prove this. If, however, we examine all the utterances of the character-bound narrator, then to say the least, a much more problematic picture emerges. And even if this narrator is an immoral hypocrite, this does not mean that the entire novel is immoral. A good deal more needs to be considered to back up the claim of immorality, always limited to the context in which the particular morality is generally accepted.</p>
                <p>These problems should be neither denied nor ignored, as a formalist approach would do. Rather, they should be clearly formulated and brought to bear on other issues. Ideological discussions and value judgments should not be censured, but should be conducted with insight into the many issues involved. Only then can they be discussed, and this can only benefit the analysis. The discussion below may help make this procedure a bit easier.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Predictability</em></strong></p>
                <p>The preceding section expanded character; this one reduces it. Both moves are necessary and productive. On the basis of bits of information, the character becomes more or less predictable. These data determine him or her, mostly so inconspicuously that the reader processes the information without giving it a thought. I call this fixating process <em>determination</em>. To begin with, there is information that is always already involved, that relates to the extra-textual situation, insofar as the reader is acquainted with it. Indeed, the moments that one realizes that some information is not “<span>in</span>” the text are precisely those moments when one fails to make a connection because of lack of information. I will treat that section of reality or the outside world to which the information about the person refers as a <em>frame of reference</em>.</p>
                <p>Few readers who have memories of the 1990s will fail to see the humour when reading, in Karen Harper’s mystery novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Black Orchid</em> (1996), “<span>‘What’s the name of that gray-haired boy who’s president right now?’ Hattie asked</span>”. We really don’t need the next sentence: “<span>‘Bill Clinton, Grandma,’ Jordan told her</span>” (68). Readers share the frame of reference in which it is elementary knowledge not only who ran the United States at that time but also that Clinton had grey hair and a boyish face. The answer, rather than identifying Clinton, serves to characterize Hattie’s relationship to her grandmother, a relationship of affectionate resignation. This frame is never entirely the same for each reader, or for reader and writer. Younger readers may not laugh at all. By frame of reference I here mean information that may with some confidence be called communal. For most American readers, Coover’s Eisenhower fits into a frame of reference of that kind.</p>
                <p>Historical characters are often brought to life in novels. Napoleon we meet quite regularly. Legendary characters, like King Arthur and Santa Claus, also fit into a frame of reference. Historical characters are not more strongly determined than legendary ones. On the contrary, legendary characters are expected to exhibit certain stereotypical behaviours and set attributes; if the story were to depart too far from these set characteristics, they would no longer be recognizable. If presented in opposition to the referential characteristics, however, such characters can be a powerful trigger of surprise, suspense, or humour. Santa Claus loves children; his whole status as a legendary character is based on that. A Santa Claus who sets out to murder people is blatantly a fiction, or as the case may be, a fake.</p>
                <p>Where historical characters are concerned, the possibilities are somewhat greater. Because we are more confident about the identity of such a character, an unfamiliar side can be shown and will be accepted more easily: a tyrant during a fit of weakness; a saint in doubt or in temptation; a party-going revolutionary. But here too the possibilities are limited because of the frame of reference. A mature Napoleon presented as a poor wretch would create a very odd effect: he would no longer be Napoleon. In yet another way, mythical and allegorical characters fit a pattern of expectation, established in the basis of our frame of reference. The goddess of justice cannot make unfair decisions without destroying her identity as a character. Only for those who know that this character is conventionally blind will a wide-eyed goddess of justice be a problem. All of these characters, which we could label referential characters because of their obvious slots in a frame of reference, act according to the pattern that we are familiar with from other sources. Or not. In both cases, the image we receive of them is determined to a large extent by the confrontation between, on the one hand, our previous knowledge and the expectations it produces, and on the other, the realization of the character in the narrative. Opting for a referential character implies, in this respect, opting for such confrontation. The ensuing determination, and the extent to which it is realized, is therefore an interesting object for study.</p>
                <p>There is another reason for such studies. The expectations aroused by the mere mention of a historical or mythical character are also traps for the reader. We tend to notice only what we already know, unless the deviation from the expectation is strongly enhanced. An amusing case is Sophocles’s King Oedipus. Owing to the success of Freud’s psychoanalysis, we all know Oedipus. He’s the guy with the Oedipus complex, of course. He killed his father and desired his mother. Well, that is precisely not the case. Oedipus the character does not have an Oedipus complex, for two opposed reasons. First, because he did nothing of the sort; he did not know the old man he killed was his father, so his act of killing did not make him a parricide. Neither did he know that the queen was his mother. Today we would say: these people were only his biological parents; his actual parents were the kind shepherd and his wife who raised him. But if this argument fails to convince, the opposite one will: he has no Oedipus complex because he acted upon his desires, whereas an Oedipus complex emerges, precisely, out of the repression of that desire. And if neither of these reasons are convincing, that is because the question – Does Sophocles’s Oedipus have an Oedipus complex? – is one of those “<span>How many children had Lady Macbeth</span>” questions.</p>
                <p>Amusing as it is, this example is highly instructive. We can deduce from it that characters don’t have an unconscious; only people do. Psychoanalytic criticism does not, or should not, consist of diagnosing characters but of understanding how texts affectively address the reader on a level that comes close to or touches unconscious preoccupations. In general, returning to the ancient texts about the mythical characters that have fed our culture’s cliches and prejudices is exciting and valuable.</p>
                <p>Referential characters are more strongly determined than entirely fictional characters. But in fact, every character is more or less predictable, from the very first time it is presented onwards. Every mention of the identity of the character contains information that limits other possibilities. Reference to a character by means of a personal pronoun alone limits its gender. And, in general, this then sets off a whole series of limitations. <em>A he</em> cannot find himself unintentionally pregnant. A <em>she</em> cannot, as long as that contested rule of priestly celibacy lasts, become a Catholic priest. Insofar as they are traditionally determined, these limitations are subject to change. One of the earliest inspirations of feminist literary studies was the insight that, in much traditional literature, women only function as protagonists in certain types of fabulas, in which the goal pursued is a characteristic of the character itself (happiness, wisdom) and not a concrete object that would necessitate a long journey or a physically taxing ordeal.</p>
                <p>When a character is indicated with “<span>I</span>” these gender restrictions do not (yet) apply, but in that case other restrictions are possible. The character, the I, is not presented from a spatial distance, and this in turn involves all sorts of other limitations. When the character is allotted its own name, this generally determines not only its sex/gender but also its social status, geographical origin, sometimes even more. Names, too, can have a bearing on the character’s characteristics. To this category belong not only names such as Tom Thumb and Snow White. Agatha Christie’s Poirot has a pear-shaped head. Miss Marple is not only a woman but also unmarried, and that state implies a number of stereotypical qualities conventionally connected with elderly unmarried ladies: inquisitiveness, a great deal of spare time, reliability, innocence, naivety; all of these qualities are necessary for the development of the fabula in which the character functions, or in a converse perspective, to which the character leads. Indeed, because of the inseparable link, including the alliteration, between the title Miss and the name Marple this character is also highly referential.</p>
                <p>A description of the exterior character further limits the possibilities. If a character is old, it does different things than if it were young. If it is attractive, it lives differently from the way it would live if it were unattractive, or so the reader tends to assume. One’s work, too, greatly determines the frame in which the events take place or from which they receive their meaning. A thatcher falls from a roof (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’assommoir</em>, Zola, 1876); sooner or later a miner will be trapped in a shaft that has collapsed (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Germinal</em>, Zola, 1885; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sans famille</em>, Malot, 1892) if he doesn’t die of some kind of lung disease; a soldier dies at the front or is sent to a faraway country (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Farewell to Arms</em>, Hemingway, 1929). None of these determining factors is determining at all. The fact that work, sex, external factors, or quirks of personality are mentioned creates an expectation. The story may fulfil that expectation but may just as easily frustrate it. Either way, character features activate the reader.</p>
                <p>Genre plays a part in a character’s predictability. A detective must, in principle, find the murderer. This genre-bound expectation is sometimes broken – for instance, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Locked Room</em> by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo (1972), where the murdering character is arrested for another crime and the mysteries are never entirely solved. The alterations to which a genre is subject are influenced by the interplay among the evocation, the satisfaction, and the frustration of expectations. The stronger the determination, the greater the shift away from the tensions generated by questions concerning the outcome and towards the tensions generated by the question whether the character will realize its own determination and/or break away from it. A character’s predictability is closely related to the reader’s frame of reference in which it seems to fit. But the effect of this predictability also depends on the reader’s attitude with respect to literature and the book he or she is reading. Is she strongly inclined to fill in, or will she let herself be led by the story? Does she read quickly, or does she interrupt the reading often to stop and think about it?</p>
                <p>What I am suggesting here is that information about a character’s predictability can only provide clues to its potential determination. Thus we can analyse the way in which possible determination emerges in the story. Afterwards we conclude that a certain detail about a character was related to an event, or to a whole series of events. Establishing connections, coherence, in this way is not the same as signalling predictability beforehand. Predictability makes it easy to find coherence; it contributes to the formation of a unified image of one character out of an abundance of information. But it is not the only way in which that image is formed. We can distinguish various relations between bits of information on the basis of which an image of a character can be formed.</p>
                <p>In general, returning to the ancient texts about the mythical characters that have fed our culture’s cliches and prejudices is exciting and valuable. It helps us to understand how thick the historical layer is on which the present rests, as well as to assess our dependence and reliance on patterns established in a culture quite different from our own. Let me give one example.</p>
                <p>The myth of Narcissus is traditionally attached to narcissism, a psychoanalytic concept that has taken on ordinary meaning and that, more often than not, is applied in a moralizing way. A narcissistic person overindulges in self-love and self-interest. Narcissus, as the myth has it, died because he did not recognize himself when he looked at the mirror-image of himself in the shiny surface of a pool, fell in love with the image, and drowned when he tried to touch it. Nor did he perceive the mirror for what it was: a boundary between reality and fiction. The erotic effect of the image worked on him, but not the formative one. In Ovid’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Metamorphoses</em>, when his mother, the nymph Liriope, consulted the seer Tiresias and asked whether her son would live to old age, the answer he gave her was: “<span>If he does not know himself</span>” (“<span>si se non nouerit</span>”, 346). Self-knowledge, which supposedly entails wisdom if spiritual, kills when “<span>carnal</span>”, erotic; or so it seems.</p>
                <p>Yet later on, the opposite seems to be the case. Ovid presents the denial of carnal knowledge as Narcissus’s fatal failure: “<span>he falls in love with an image without body</span>” (“<span>spem sine corpore amat</span>” 417). Imputing bodily existence to what is only a visual image – or, in this case, water – he condemns himself (“<span>corpus putat esse quod unda est</span>”, 417). This story of “<span>death and the image</span>” is about the denial of the true, natural body.</p>
                <p>Prefiguring Narcissus’s imminent demise, Ovid enacts his soon-tooccur rigor mortis:</p>
                <blockquote>He remains immobile, his face impassive, like a statue sculpted in marble of Paros. (Adstupet ipse sibi uultuque inmotus eodem haeret, ut e Pario formatum marmore signum.) (418–19)</blockquote>
                <p>“<span>Ut signum</span>”: he becomes like a sign – an iconic sign of a sign – as an enactment of radical constructivism: a character is a construction, not a person. Notwithstanding common lore, Narcissus is not wrong to admire himself: “<span>He admires everything that makes him admirable</span>” (“<span>cunctaque mirator quibus est mirabilis ipse</span>”, 424). His tragedy is brought about not by excessive self-love so much as by naive realism: “<span>what you are seeking does not exist</span>” (“<span>quod petit est nusquam</span>”, 433). He does, in the end, recognize that he loves himself, and, destroyed by the sense of tragic hopelessness that he has inflicted so often upon others, he begins his slow descent into death. Rather than blaming him – or the narcissism named after the mythical figure – for moral shortcomings or formative failure, I propose that we take Ovid’s Narcissus as an allegory of the reader who conflates character and person.</p>
                <p>,<strong><em>Construction of Content</em></strong></p>
                <p>When a character appears for the first time, we do not yet know very much about it. The qualities that are implied in that first presentation are not all grasped by the reader. In the course of the narrative the relevant characteristics are repeated so often that they emerge more and more clearly. Repetition is thus an important principle of the construction of the image of a character. Along with repetition, the piling up of data fulfils a function in the construction of an image. The accumulation of characteristics causes odd facts to coalesce, complement one another, and form a whole: the image of a character.</p>
                <p>Relations with others also help build the image of a character. The character’s relation to itself in an earlier phase also belongs to this category. These relations tend to be processed into similarities and contrasts. A semantic model for describing these categories is a reflection of cultural cognitive habits. Finally, characters change. The changes or transformations that a character undergoes sometimes alter the entire configuration of character as it looked during the analysis of mutual relations. Once a character’s most important characteristics have been selected, it is easier to trace transformations and to describe them clearly.</p>
                <p>Repetition, accumulation, relations to other characters, and transformations are four different principles that work together to construct the image of a character. Their effect can only be described, however, when the outline of the character has been roughly filled in. This is a constant element in narratological analysis: a dialectic back-and-forth between speculation and verification through open-minded analysis.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Filling In, Fleshing Out</em></strong></p>
                <p>How do we decide which we consider provisionally to be a character’s relevant characteristics and which are of secondary importance? One method involves selecting relevant semantic axes. Semantic axes are pairs of contrary meanings. Characteristics like “<span>large</span>” and “<span>small</span>” could be a relevant semantic axis; so could rich–poor, man–woman, kind–unkind, reactionary–progressive. Selecting relevant semantic axes involves focusing, out of all the characteristics mentioned – usually an unmanageably large number – only on those axes that determine the image of the largest possible number of characters, positively or negatively. Of the axes that involve only a few characters or even just one, only those are analysed that are “<span>strong</span>” (striking or exceptional) or that are related to an important event. Such a selection involves the ideological position of the analyst and also points at ideological stances represented in the story, and can therefore be a powerful tool for critique. Once one has chosen the relevant semantic axes, this selection can function as a means of mapping out the similarities and oppositions between the characters. With the help of this information we can determine the qualifications with which a character is endowed. But by whom? By the story, or by the reader? This is an ongoing question, to be continued with “<span>why?</span>” Because the features are attributed to the character by a focalizer, I use the concept <em>qualification</em> rather than “<span>quality</span>”, which suggests they really possess those features.</p>
                <p>Some qualifications belong to a social or a family role. In such cases, determination comes into play. A character is, for instance, a farmer and a father. Both roles strongly determine what qualifications he receives. In a case like this, no one will be surprised if the character – in a traditional story – is strong, hard-working, and strict. The opposite of strong is (let’s say for the moment) weak; of hard-working, lazy; of strict, flexible. A character with an equally clear role fills the opposite pole along each of these axes. It will hardly surprise anyone if the farmer is contrasted with his weak, effeminate, artistic, or studious son. In accordance with prejudice, the young man will be lazy. The qualification “<span>flexible</span>” is hardly applicable to the son, who does not occupy the kind of position of power that allows him the choice between strictness and leniency. This pole will be filled – how could it be otherwise? – by his mother. If we now attempted to collect the various qualities we have isolated for all these cliche characters, we would end up with a diagram of the following kind, which, for the sake of clarity, is somewhat crude.</p>
                <p>character qualification:</p>
                <p>role:</p>
                <p>farmer/father (strength + diligence + flexibility –)</p>
                <p>student/son (strength – diligence – flexibility 0)</p>
                <p>mother (strength 0 diligence 0 flexibility +)</p>
                <p>Here:</p>
                <p>+ = positive pole</p>
                <p>– = negative pole</p>
                <p>0 = unmarked</p>
                <p>This results in a picture of a set of characters, strongly determined by social and family roles. The father is not only qualified as strong; he is also the most strongly qualified character. Two of the three qualifications mark him as positive; all three apply to him. The mother plays a less prominent part, in accordance with her social position. She is marked by one quality alone, albeit a positive one. The young man is marked twice, both times negatively. The mutual relations between the characters are immediately visible. In this way, more complexly structured sets of characters may also be mapped out.</p>
                <p>But binary opposition, as a structure of thought, is problematic. The process of establishing semantic axes of this kind subjects its object – say, a particular semantic field – to three successive logical moves, each of which aggravates the damage: reduction, of an infinitely rich but also chaotic field, to two centres; the articulation of those centres into polar opposites; and the hierarchization of these two into a positive term and a negative one. But here, logic catches up with this structure of thought. For the logic of opposition has it that negativity is by definition vague, if not void. It cannot be defined, and hence it cannot be articulated, and as a result it remains unmanageable.</p>
                <p>Once we analyse which characters appear marked by a certain semantic axis, we can set up – using a diagram such as this – a hierarchy of strongly and weakly marked characters. If the same axes with the same values, positive or negative, mark a number of characters, they can be regarded as <em>synonymous</em> characters – that is, characters with the same content. Inconspicuous duplications of characters can thus become visible. But this is an overly simplistic two-way division of axes. It can be useful to determine whether differences of degree and modality are evident within each qualification. Degree can transform a polar scale into a sliding scale, from very strong, reasonably strong, not strong enough, somewhat weak, to a weakling. Modality can result in nuance: certainly, probably, perhaps, probably not. Especially if synonymous characters have been discovered, these can allow for a valuable refinement of the descriptive model.</p>
                <p>So far, this model is blatantly ideological, not only because of the content of the axes, but also due to the binary structure itself. It depends on our use of it whether it is a mode of projecting ideology on the text or, on the contrary, whether it is a critical tool that lays bare the text’s ideological tenets. Moving from the one position to the other is the goal of a critical analysis. To move beyond believing in the truth of such an analysis, and instead to examine the contents of the character further, we can look at the connections among the various characteristics. Are, for instance, certain sexes constantly combined with a certain ideological position? In many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century novels a clear connection can be discerned between the male sex and a military ideology. There is, however, no systematic connection in the same corpus between the female sex and a pacifist attitude, although sometimes there is (e.g., in Corneille’s play <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Horace</em>, 1640). When there is not, in female characters the axis militarism–pacifism is not marked. The question then arises whether the fact that a certain character or group of characters is not marked by a certain axis has any significance. If in a seventeenth-century novel the women do not take a clear stand either for or against war, this can certainly be regarded as significant: it indicates something about their (lack of) social position. The very binary opposition that is such an ideological trap also helps us notice ideological positions.</p>
                <p>A character exhibits more than similarities to and differences from other characters. Often, there is a connection or a discrepancy between the character, its situation, and its environment. Finally, the description of a character that has been obtained can be contrasted with an analysis of the functions it performs in a series of events. What kinds of actions does a character perform, and what role does it play in the fabula? This confrontation can yield information about the construction of the story with respect to the fabula. Because of a certain event, alterations may take place in the “<span>build</span>” of a character, and internal relations between the various characters may also change. Conversely, alterations in the make-up of a character may influence events and determine the outcome of the fabula.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Information</em></strong></p>
                <p>How do we come by our information about a character? Either the character itself mentions characteristics explicitly, or we deduce them from what the character does. We refer to a <em>qualification</em> when the information is given directly by a character. There are various ways this happens. If a character talks about itself and to itself, it is practising self-analysis. We cannot be sure that it is judging itself correctly; indeed, in literature we encounter many unreliable, deceitful, immature, incompetent, mentally disturbed self-analysts. The genres that are particularly well suited to this manner of qualification are obviously the autobiographical ones: diary, confession, autobiographical novel. In “<span>The Tell-Tale Heart</span>” (1843), Edgar Allan Poe allows his character to explain why he is not insane, although he has murdered someone, and these confessions clearly demonstrate, because of their negation, the existence of his insanity.</p>
                <p>A character can talk about itself to others. If it receives an answer, the qualification becomes plural, in that it is derived from various sources. If one character says something about another character, this may or may not lead to a confrontation. The character under discussion may or may not be present. If it is, it can react, confirming or denying what has been said. If it is not, it may or may not already know what people think of it. A third possibility for explicit qualification lies with a third party outside the fabula: the narrator makes statements about the character. This agent, too, may be reliable or unreliable. The party, for instance, that presents Dombey in Dickens’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dombey and Son</em> as an entirely decent man is unreliable. This presentation involves irony.</p>
                <p>When a character is presented by means of her actions, we deduce from these certain implicit qualifications. Such an implicit, indirect qualification may be labelled a <em>qualification by function</em>. The reader’s frame of reference becomes a crucial element in picking up such qualifications. A deserter is, say, qualified as either a pacifist or a coward. A revolutionary who participates in a wild party qualifies either as an epicurean or as a hypocrite. Moreover, one character can do something to another that qualifies the latter, or that seduces him into qualifying himself. A detective who unmasks a murderer qualifies that character as a murderer. In such cases, the qualification is explicit. But before the final arrest takes place the detective can lure her suspect into a trap, so that the latter qualifies himself as a murderer. She can also, without words, push a gun to his chest, produce a piece of evidence, and directly qualify him as a murderer.</p>
                <p>A good example is the tenacious idea that the biblical character Eve in Genesis 2 and 3 is both derivative, and therefore inferior to her male counterpart, and wicked, because she disobeyed the deity who forbade the humans to eat from the tree in the middle of the Garden of Eden. Both interpretations are anachronistic – the former because the logic of the story is not based on the chronological priority as superior, and the latter because it fills in with a later moralizing interpretation what in the story is very differently interpreted. Both wrong-headed interpretations are based on a plus/minus logic of positive/negative.</p>
                <p>If, however, we look at the text in which this story occurs, we immediately notice that the divine act of creation is based on separation but without necessarily attributing the values attached in the traditional interpretation. Separating dark from light, water from earth, animals from humans – all of this is what creation <em>is</em>. By this logic, taking a morsel of earth and kneading a human figure out of it is one such separation. This earth creature, named after the whole from which it was taken (Adam, from <em>ha adama</em>), is emphatically androgynous. Genesis 1:27 reads: “<span>So God created man(kind) in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them</span>”. At this point that creation has not yet taken place. This happens in two phases in Genesis 2. In verse 7, the earth creature is shaped from mud, or clay. Then in verse 22, from the rib of that earth creature a woman is shaped. Her name, Eve, or Hawah, is close to Yaweh, indicating that she, too, is capable of creating, if only in the sense of procreating. If need be, we can say that she is superior to Adam in the sense of more developed; but there is, of course, no such need – why would we take such guidance into social life from a story millennia old? But the opposite – to proclaim woman’s inferiority on the basis of this story – is clearly wrong.</p>
                <p>As for the transgression of the interdiction to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, Eve’s reasoning is that it is a fruit that will make her wise. Instead of being greedy or lustful, as is often alleged, she endorses the human condition, where procreation compensates for mortality. Adam acknowledges this: “<span>And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living</span>” (3:20). I am turning to this story simply to demonstrate, not that the “<span>truth</span>” of it is different from what we tend to assume, but to show how interpretations, if they are not critical of their own models, lead us astray. The difference between the standard interpretation and this one only goes to show that structural analysis must come with its own critique if it is to avoid the ideological manipulations it is meant to counter. To be critically literate is to see not only what the text does but also what we do with it.</p>
                <p>If we now involve the various frequency possibilities as well, further differentiation becomes possible. Every qualification is always durative, so that the frequency possibilities are restricted to two. The implicit qualification through action can be split into potential actions (plans) and realized ones. The first category of information sources leads to explicit qualification, the second to implicit qualification. Explicit qualifications shed more light than implicit ones, but that light need not be reliable. Different readers can interpret implicit, indirect qualifications differently, as in the case of the deserter. But implicit qualifications may also provide a means of uncovering lies and revealing secrets.</p>
                <p>On the basis of sources of information, a division can be established, so as to classify the character according to the degree of emphasis with which it is qualified. The more ways in which the qualification is communicated, the more frequently a character is qualified, the more emphasis it receives. In conjunction with the number of semantic axes by which it is marked, a classification of characters may be achieved that is somewhat subtler and more plausible than the old one based on round and flat characters.</p>
                <p>It is crucial to take enough distance from this anthropomorphism to understand, for instance, that Proust’s Albertine is a paper person in the true sense. Looking more closely at this character makes us aware of the extent to which Proust’s modernist masterpiece has strong features of what would later be called postmodernism. Such a close look helps us to understand his novel beyond realist projections and to relativize the periodization that forms the backbone of literary history. Albertine is an object of the protagonist’s obsession, and does what he thinks she does; and when he no longer needs her to make his point about the relationship between jealousy, love, and knowledge, she dies in an unlikely accident. Once we accept that she has no psychological depth of her own, we not only grasp the specifically Proustian construction of character – which is crucial for an appreciation of the work – but also the aesthetic and epistemological thrust of the narrative. In contrast, a realistic reading of this character as a “<span>real girl</span>” will only frustrate us, make her irritating and antipathetic, and the CN a selfish monster (this has actually been alleged against Proust in all seriousness). What the character as analogue to humans loses in appeal, it gains in literary excitement. Proust’s masterpiece is much more fascinating when it is allowed to play with its paper people than when it is reduced to realist, moralist norms.</p>
                <p>Indeed, Proust’s Albertine is explicitly presented as flat – a flatness that precisely constitutes the complexity of this figure, if not her “<span>density</span>”. To get a sense of the relevance of character analysis on the basis of an endorsement of its impossibility, let us take a look at how this character emerges. Albertine is first noticed by Marcel, and selected from within a group and chosen to be his love object, on the basis of an image of her at a distance, on the beach. This is no easy selection. The first description of her hardly singles her out:</p>
                <blockquote>But I could not arrive at any certainty, for the face of these girls did not fill a constant space, did not present a constant form upon the beach, contracted, dilated, transformed as it was by my own expectancy, by the anxiousness of my desire, or by a sense of self-sufficient well-being, the different clothes they wore, the rapidity of their walk or their stillness. (II 867)</blockquote>
                <p>The description of Albertine is not simply an account of the perception of her by the narrator. Others evoke her first – as “<span>the famous ‘Albertine’</span>” (I 552), then as “<span>You’ve no idea how insolent she is, that child</span>” (I 643). Both prefigurations, if I may call them that, occur while the narrator is still pining for Gilberte, his first love. The real sighting of Albertine – there is not yet a meeting – occurs in an extended descriptive-reflective passage that takes no less than ten pages, in “<span>Place-names: The Place</span>” of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Within a Budding Grove</em>.</p>
                <p>It begins with “<span>In the midst of all these people</span>” (I 847) and ends when Marcel enters the hotel (“<span>I went indoors</span>”, I 856), with the end of his stroll, hence, in terms of the event in the fabula, quite arbitrarily. This piece is an astonishing allegory of the difficulty of describing because of the impossibility of knowing other people. The problems of <em>distinction</em> and its inevitable arbitrariness are at the heart of the event and highlight the fundamental artificiality of character. Let me select just a few moments from this extended passage. The length of the passage is motivated by a struggle to keep abreast of an accelerated temporality that rules the novel’s combined temporalities of fabula, discourse, and reading that the story sums up.</p>
                <p>The phrase “<span><em>In the midst</em> of all these people ... the girls <em>whom I had noticed …</em></span>” introduces a description of the girls’ collective movement through space as they walk towards the narrator. In the fabula the latter is diegetically walking towards, in the text, “<span>speaking</span>” about, and in the story, “<span>reading</span>” the <em>spectacle</em> of the girls. (In this analysis, all emphases are added.) When he sees them from closer proximity, the rationale for the collective description is rendered in a combined terminology of classification and aesthetics: “<span>Although each was <em>of a type</em> absolutely different from the others, they all had <em>beauty</em>; … I had yet not individualized any of them</span>”. The struggle for distinction is rendered in a nightmare that resembles a parody of descriptive detailing, and explained through the effect of time: “<span>I saw a pallid oval, black eyes, green eyes, <em>emerge</em>, I did not know if these were the same that had already charmed me <em>a moment ago</em>, I could not relate them to any one girl whom I had set apart from the rest and identified</span>” (847).</p>
                <p>The narrator experiences the incapacity to distinguish as a lack (“<span>want</span>”), but also as a source of beauty. Thus he is placed outside of himself and his subjectivity as perceiving agent: “<span>And this <em>want</em>, in my vision, of the demarcations which I <em>should presently</em> establish between them <em>permeated</em> the group with a sort of <em>shimmering</em> harmony, the <em>continuous transmutation</em> of a fluid, collective and <em>mobile</em> beauty</span>” (747–8). The source of beauty is the negation of distinction, yet time lifts a prescriptive finger (“<span>should presently</span>”). Clashing with this routine temporality is the temporality that inheres in the group: “<span>continuous transmutation</span>”, the mobility that is the site of beauty. Clearly, a stable character endowed with permanent beauty is not going to result from this descriptive dystopia.</p>
                <p>The rhetorical make-up of this initial stage of the production of the character-effect is reconfirmed throughout the passage (e.g., “<span>to the delight of the other girls, especially of a pair of green eyes in a doll-like face</span>” 849). But even when distinction is achieved, the result is emphatically not closer to an individualizing and stabilizing character description. “<span>By this time their charming features had ceased to be indistinct and jumbled</span>” (850), confirms the narrator in an uncharacteristically short, summing-up sentence, but</p>
                <blockquote>I had dealt them <em>like cards</em> into so many heaps to compose […]: the tall one who had just jumped over the old banker; the little one silhouetted against the horizon of sea with her plump and rosy cheeks and green eyes; the one with the straight nose and dark complexion who <em>stood out among the rest …</em></blockquote>
                <p>Curiously, the first act of distinction is hidden in a subclause (“<span>who stood out</span>”), whereas the actual description of the chosen one is couched in an emphatically parallel series (“<span>the one with the straight nose</span>”). The next step is based on the usual (deceptive) appearances and negativity: “<span>a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, matte cheeks, a black polo-cap crammed on her head, who was pushing a bicycle</span>” is cast as belonging to the popular classes, as being of light virtue, and as rather vulgar. One motivation for the negative judgments that accompany the descriptions – in terms of both social class and ethical judgments – is the continuous adjustment that problematizes appearance. Another, I propose, is to isolate for consideration the ethics of representing the other as such, which ultimately leads to an ontological assessment. Ideological reduction appears, in effect, to result from character description.</p>
                <p>But distinction on the level of the fabula – the represented object – is not enough to facilitate a successful emergence of the character. Even after this crucial moment of election, the narrator continues his musings on the impossibility of individualizing:</p>
                <blockquote>Though they were now separately identifiable, still the <em>interplay of their eyes</em>, animated with self-assurance … an invisible but harmonious bond, like a <em>single</em> warm shadow… making of them a whole as homogeneous in its parts as it was different from the crowd through which their procession gradually wound. (851)</blockquote>
                <p>And for hundreds of pages, the narrator continues to struggle with the impossibility of knowing his elected other.</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Prisoner</em>, Albertine, who has lost her former, fixed quality of the beach photo, consists only of a series of snapshots:</p>
                <blockquote>... a person, scattered in space and time, is no longer a woman but a series of events on which we can throw <em>no light</em>, a series of insoluble problems. (99–100; emphasis added)</blockquote>
                <p>The shift from the typically modernist preoccupation with epistemological uncertainty (“<span>no light</span>”) to the ontological doubt that results when one radically thinks through what epistemological doubt entails (“<span>is no longer a woman</span>”) announces postmodernism, and the philosophically rich phrase “<span>scattered in time and space</span>” articulates that shift. That “<span>woman</span>” as “<span>other</span>” falls prey to a true lunacy of the snapshot is, of course, no coincidence. This dissolution in visual, flat seriality is only aggravated as Marcel tries to counter it and “<span>fix</span>” Albertine by means of “<span>light</span>” thrown on her, and on paper. Thus she ends up <em>becoming</em> (ontology) the sheet on which the <em>images</em> (epistemology) of jealousy (psychology) are going to be fixed:</p>
                <blockquote>For I possessed in my memory only a series of Albertines, separate from one another, incomplete, a collection of profiles or snapshots, and so my jealousy was restricted to a discontinuous expression, at once fugitive and fixed ... (145–6)</blockquote>
                <p>With the word “<span>memory</span>” keeping the issue also on the level of epistemology, ontological “<span>fugitivity</span>” is presented here as a perversion of memory. The final words here – in French, “<span>a la fois fugitive et fixee</span>” – define quite precisely the nature of the series of snapshots and explain the specific use of this poetic in the novel. The importance of eroticism is crucial: the object of this fugitive fixing is the love object of whom the focalizing narrator is unable to assess with certainty the sexual orientation. Obviously, Albertine’s “<span>flatness</span>” can in no way be considered a lack of “<span>density</span>”. On the contrary, it is of essential importance for this “<span>dense</span>” novel that she be flat. I propose to generalize this. Both <em>fugitive</em> – as a being – and <em>fixed</em> – in the words of the novel that capture it – the character is an effect that makes us believe in the human nature of a creature that is constantly resisting that humanity in favour of other important insights it has to offer. This is the game of make-believe in fiction – a game that is, according to the specific insights it produces, truer than truth.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">7: Space</h3>
                <p>Together with character, few concepts deriving from the theory of narrative texts are as self-evident yet have remained so vague as the concept of space. The concept of space is sandwiched between that of focalization, of which the representation of space constitutes a special case, and that of place, a category of fabula elements. It is also, obviously, an important aspect of visuality in narrative.</p>
                <p>There are also spatial descriptions generated by the travelling gaze of an external focalizer, who fails to receive recognizable embodiment but in fact anticipates or otherwise represents particular characters’ visions. The result is the analogue not of a photograph but of a film; specifically, of that device of the travelling shot that so precisely incorporates the moving image in space. The description of Yonville in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em>, which follows the devastating ending of the first part already quoted, is a case in point. It constitutes the travelling gaze that generates it, or rather, the gaze of the travel guide. That gaze binds character to space.</p>
                <p>The procedural description is a typical case of naturalizing mimesis as make-believe. As the character manipulates an object, the latter emerges for the viewer. The beginning of Zola’s <em>L’assommoir</em> displays an entirely theatricalized fight between two women competing for the man who will bring the downfall of the winner. This is the occasion of the descriptive thrust that conjures up the women, the space of the public laundry pit, the extension of the space through the onlooking crowd, and the bone of contention that structures the fabula; the story can unfold after that. This is an example of how spatial arrangement in the story connects discourse to fabula, an arrangement that can be as artificial as it can be naturalizing. But the world that emerges appears, or is made to appear. In other words, between the naturalization of the fabula world and its theatrical, artificial <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scène</em> in the story, there is a fine line that fiction constantly transgresses, leaving it up to the reader to go along in one direction or another.</p>
                <p>Places are linked to certain points of perception. These places seen in relation to their perception constitute the story’s space. That point of perception may be a character, which is situated in a space, observes it, and reacts to it. An anonymous point of perception can also dominate the presentation of certain places. The general question concerning the various points of perception, which lies at the root of every presentation, will be discussed later.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Space Perceived</em></strong></p>
                <p>In the story, where space is connected to the characters that live it, the primary aspect of space is the way characters bring their senses to bear on it. Three senses are especially involved in the perceptual representation of space: sight, hearing, and touch. All three participate in the presentation of a space in the story. Shapes, colours, and sizes are perceived visually, always from a particular perspective. Sounds contribute to the presentation of space. If a character hears a low murmuring, it is still at a certain distance from the speakers. If it can understand word for word what is being said, then it is situated much nearer, in the same room, for instance, or behind a thin screen. A church bell sounding in the distance increases the space; suddenly perceived whispering points to the proximity of the whisperer. Third, there is touch. Tactile perceptions usually have little spatial significance. Touch indicates proximity. If a character feels walls on all sides, then it is confined in a very small space. Tactile perception is often used in a story to indicate the material, the substance of objects. Smell can contribute to the characterization of space but less obviously to its experience <em>qua</em> space. Taste is rarely relevant in this context. With the help of these three senses, two kinds of relations pertain between characters and space. First, the space in which the character is situated, or is precisely not situated, is regarded as the <em>frame</em>. Second, the way in which that space is filled can also be indicated. A character can be situated in a space it experiences as secure, while earlier on, outside that space, it felt unsafe.</p>
                <p>a For hours, he wandered through the dark forest. All of a sudden, he saw a light. He hurried towards the house and knocked on the door. With a sigh of relief, he shut the door behind him a moment later.</p>
                <p>Both inner and outer space function, in this instance, as a frame. Their opposition gives both spaces their meaning.</p>
                <p>These meanings are not fixed. An inner space is often also experienced as unsafe, but with a somewhat different meaning. The inner space can, for instance, be experienced as confinement, while the outer space represents liberation and, consequently, security.</p>
                <p>b With a sigh of relief he presently closed the door behind himself. Free at last!</p>
                <p>In both examples, the frame has a highly symbolic function. Of course, this is far from always the case. But culturally, it often is, and the boundary that delimits the frame can be heavily invested with meaning. Narratives can endorse that meaning, reject or change it, or play on different ways in which characters are situated in relation to it. And narrative quite frequently feeds off the horror of the invasion of space that leads to destruction. Often, the rape of women is allegorically related to invasion and destruction of space. The more allegorical this fable, the more political becomes its moral. The objects that can be found in space determine the filling in of that space. Objects have spatial status. They determine the spatial effect of the room by their shape, measurements, and colours. A cluttered room seems smaller, a sparsely furnished room bigger than in fact it is. The way in which objects are arranged in a space, the configuration of objects, also influences the perception of that space. In some stories, an object or objects are presented in detail. In other stories, space may be presented in a vague and implicit manner.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Content and Function</em></strong></p>
                <p>The semantic content of spatial aspects can be constructed in the same way as the semantic content of a character. Here, too, we find a preliminary combination of determination, repetition, accumulation, transformation, and the relations between various spaces.</p>
                <p>Determination is again achieved on the basis of the reader’s frame of reference. When a certain event is situated in Dublin, this will mean something different to the reader who is well acquainted with the city than to the reader who only knows that Dublin is a large city. The oppressive atmosphere of a dwelling in one of the poorer districts of Dublin is presented in a fairly detailed way in Joyce’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>. Those who are already familiar with that atmosphere will immediately be able to visualize much more, in more precise images. On the other hand, the unknowing reader has the freedom to imagine, to construct the kitchen and parlour and test that construction against information provided as we read on.</p>
                <p>Determination functions here too on the basis of the general application of characteristics. One big city has a number of characteristics in common with every other big city. This also applies to the countryside, a village, a street, a house, and every general category. The more precise the presentation of a space, the greater the number of specific qualities added to the general ones, which then become steadily less dominating. But general characteristics don’t cease to function. Only by means of general characteristics is it possible to create an image at all.</p>
                <p>Spaces function in a story in different ways. On the one hand, they are only frames, places of action. In this capacity a more or less detailed presentation will lead to a picture of that space. The space can also remain entirely in the background. In many cases, however, space is thematized: it becomes an object of presentation itself. Space thus becomes an acting place rather than the place of action. It influences the fabula, and the fabula becomes subordinate to the presentation of space. The fact that “<span>this is happening here</span>” is just as important as “<span>the way it is here</span>”, which allows these events to happen. In both cases, where both frame-space and thematized space are concerned, space can function steadily or dynamically. A steady space is a fixed frame, thematized or not, within which the events take place. A dynamically functioning space is a factor that allows for the movement of characters. Characters walk, and therefore need a path. They travel, and so need a large space, countries, seas, and air. The hero of a fairy tale has to traverse a dark forest to prove his courage. So there is a forest.</p>
                <p>Such a space is present not as a fixed frame but rather as a passage to be taken, and can vary greatly. From a fast train, the traveller does not see the trees separately, but rather as one long, blurred line. In Proust there are masterful passages that explore in detail how speed changes the vision of, and thereby the way of being in, space. Or the sound of a bird suddenly changes the space radically. Space is indicated exactly for this reason, as a space in which the traveller is moving. To put it differently, a traveller in narrative is in a sense always an allegory of the travel that narrative is.</p>
                <p>Strategically, the movement of characters can constitute a transition from one space to another. Often, one space will be the other’s opposite. A person is travelling, for instance, from a negative to a positive space – or vice versa. The space need not be the goal of that move. The latter may have quite a different aim, with space representing an important or an unimportant interim between departure and arrival, difficult or easy to traverse.</p>
                <p>The character that is moving towards a goal need not always arrive in another space. In many travel stories, the movement is a goal in itself. It is expected to result in a change, liberation, introspection, wisdom, or knowledge. It tends to be gender-specific as well: in traditional genres, men travel, whereas women stay at home. As a result, the development of epic literature is bound up with men, that of lyric literature with women. This is not to say that narrative is a men’s mode. There is no direct line from epic to the novel. On the contrary, the case can be made that the novel emerged as a women’s genre. In this respect, recent revivals of epic emerging out of postcolonial recuperations of space offer a great challenge to any deterministic presuppositions about the development of genres. Epic tends to become bound up less with a glorious mythical past of conquest than with a resistance to such conquests and a renewed attempt of the former colonized to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">take</em> place – that is, to provide the occupied space with a fabula that affirms their own belonging to it. Space then, becomes a site of memory.</p>
                <p>If such an experiential aim is lacking, even implicitly, the movement, totally aimless, can function simply as a presentation of space. The move can be a circular one: the character returns to its point of departure. In this way, space is presented as a labyrinth, as unsafety, as confinement. The question of how space is experienced by the character in relation to whom it is presented is more important than generalizing answers.</p>
                <p>The title of the novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Migas de pan</em> (see above) alludes to the fairy tale of Tom Thumb, who tried to make a trail of bread crumbs to find his way back home but didn’t think of the birds who would eat the crumbs. This allusion is more relevant than the difference in genre would suggest. The powerlessness of the child, the meagre bits of sustenance, and the birds as others who would take the last morsels of food from a dying man: all of this reprises the mode of tragedy in the novel of the twice-sequestered Josue. Even the repetition occurs in both stories – the first time Tom and his siblings were taken away into the forest to get lost, he used pebbles; then it happened again, and he used the crumbs, to no avail. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Migas</em>, similarly, there is the repetition of, first, the concentration camp, which Josue survived, then the capture by <em>guerilleros</em>, from which the novel does not let him re-emerge.</p>
                <p>I call on this novel again in this section because it is such an extreme instance of the deployment of space to build the story. Although we know quite early on that the story’s present concerns the abduction of the father, the novel as a whole primarily tells of the family’s waiting, especially the son’s. Samuel is the principal character. Although he knew the events surrounding both his parents’ experiences during the war, now that he is the man of the house, negotiating with the abductors by phone and spending his time awaiting and dreading phone calls, the actual story is that of his relationship to the house, mediated by the father’s occupation of its rooms for museifying purposes. One room is devoted to the theatre of time – I have quoted some passages from that chapter. Another room is a hospital for words. Josue perceived words as sick people, and he wanted this hospital to help heal words that had been damaged by lies, hatred, and violence. Since the book in which this strange story is presented also consists of words, the “<span>hospital</span>” and its doctor – Josue – must be taken seriously as a dramatization of a poetological vision translated into spatial sections, or galleries.</p>
                <p>The children learned to wash their hands before entering – also their words. Josue had established the rules:</p>
                <blockquote>“<span>Necesitamos pulir las palabras, desinfectarlas, porque ellas tambien se contaminan. Nos corresponde poner el pasado delante de nosotros, para comprenderlo y curarlo. Debemos situarnos en aquel lugar donde el futuro se convierte en presente</span>” (We must clean and disinfect the words, because they, too, contaminate one another. We must place the past in front of us, in order to understand and cure it. We must place ourselves in that place where the future becomes the present. 171)</blockquote>
                <p>This vision of the father encompasses an attempt to “<span>psychoanalyse</span>” words – to use words in order to clean them of abuse.</p>
                <p>Another room is devoted to objects. These too are in need of help, and again that help is a question of words. They are attached to words, and hence the same need for curing applies. This chapter, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Salon del Dorado</span>” (The Room of Gold), evokes conversations among objects. Ashes need to talk (183), says Josue to his bemused children. In the chapter devoted to a space with a made-up name, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no"><em>El Memoratro</em> o el teatro de la memoria</span>” (The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memorater</em> or the Theatre of Memory), the stories of campmates are being told. Comparing his gallery to the Palace of the Inquisition in Cartagena where Josue once took his children on a holiday, he calls the latter space a “<span>theatre of forgetting</span>”, a space where a concerted effort is being made to erase the horrors. On the usefulness of the self-made word “<span><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memoratro</em></span>”, Samuel concludes, in a flash of insight into what mattered to his father and why:</p>
                <blockquote>Para Josue era importante tener una palabra, volver palpable la memoria y establecer un espacio para activarla. (For Josue it was important to hold a word, to make palpable the memory and to establish a space to activate it; 217)</blockquote>
                <p>This relation to space and to words that lay dormant until they become new, active, cured of abuse, is what this novel stages.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Relations to Other Aspects</em></strong></p>
                <p>Relations between the various aspects on the story level arise because of the way in which they are combined and presented. The same holds for relations between aspects and the various elements of the fabula. The relations between space and event become clear when we think of well-known, stereotypical combinations: declarations of love by moonlight on a balcony, high-flown reveries on a mountain-top, a rendezvous at an inn, ghostly appearances among ruins, brawls in cafes. In medieval literature, love scenes frequently take place in a special space, appropriate to the occasion, the so-called <em>locus amoenus</em>, consisting of a meadow, a tree, a running stream. Such a fixed combination is called a <em>topos</em> – the Greek word for place. In the literature of later periods, too, certain combinations occur that are sometimes characteristic of a writer, sometimes of a movement, and sometimes even of a novel. But the expectation that a clearly marked space will function as the frame of a suitable event can also be frustrated.</p>
                <p>The most obvious place to expect examples of the relations between space and character in modern literature would seem to be the naturalistic novel, since it claims to depict the influence of the environment on people. A person’s living space is connected to his character, his way of life, and his possibilities. In this sense, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> can also be regarded as naturalistic, although the introspective nature of the narration tips it into modernism. Stephen Dedalus is obviously a product of impoverished circumstances. His way of life, his poor diet, his incessant scratching because of lice, his family’s constant moves to ever-shabbier neighbourhoods are in complete accordance with the space in which he lives. The spatial position in which characters are situated at a certain moment often influences their mood. A space situated high up sometimes causes spirits to be high, so that the character is exalted (Stendhal). A highly situated space, where the character happens not to be, but that it is looking up to, or with which it is confronted in some other way, can depress the character by its very inaccessibility (Kafka, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Castle)</em>.</p>
                <p>The relationship between time and space is important for the narrative rhythm. When a space is presented in great detail, an interruption of the time sequence is unavoidable, unless the perception of the space takes place gradually (in time) and can therefore be regarded as an event. When a character enters a church to sightsee and the interior of the church is presented during its tour, there is no interruption. Spatial indications are always durative (an extreme case of iteration). After all, a permanent object is always involved. In this sense too, the chronology is always disrupted by spatial indications. Moreover, information concerning space is often repeated, to emphasize the stability of the frame, as opposed to the transitory nature of the events that occur within it.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Information</em></strong></p>
                <p>As I have said before, space is always implicitly necessary for every activity performed by a character. If a character is cycling, we know it is outside and is riding on a path or a road. We assume that it sleeps in a bed. And if the information is added that it is sleeping soundly, then we assume that the bed is warm and comfortable.</p>
                <p>There are various ways to explicitly present information about space. Sometimes a very short indication, without details, is sufficient:</p>
                <p>c At home, John puts down the shopping-bag, with a sigh.</p>
                <p>d As soon as he had shut the door, John placed the shopping bag underneath the coat rack.</p>
                <p>In c the indication of space is minimal; we only know that John is again inside, in his own home. Earlier presentations of that house will determine whether we are able to visualize in a more or less detailed way what the space is like in which he is situated. In d we know more, even if this indication is also quite brief. We know that, in the context of Western European floor plans, he is in the hall and that he has not, for instance, walked straight through to the kitchen. So he came in through the front door. When separate segments of narrative are devoted to the presentation of information about space alone, we have descriptions. The space is then not simply indicated in passing, but is an explicit object of presentation.</p>
                <p>Finally, a space is sometimes indicated explicitly, not because of an action taking place in it, but because of an action performed with it. An expression like “<span>we crashed into a tree</span>” belongs to this category of indications. People do walk into walls, literally and figuratively, if a space is too small, confined. Other examples are to scale a fence, to escape from prison, to lock someone in, to hide something, to clear a path through the jungle, to ascend to heaven, to go to hell. The effect of information about space is not determined solely by the way in which it is conveyed. The distance from which the space is presented also affects the image that emerges. If a space is presented from far away, an overview of the whole is usually given, without details. Conversely, a space that is presented from nearby will be described in a detailed way, but the overview will be missing.</p>
                <p>Finally, both the image of a character and the image of a space offered to the reader are determined by the way in which the character and the space are seen. The question “<span>Who is seeing?</span>” is therefore an important aspect. This has already been noted several times. Now, finally, we can consider the key aspect of the story: focalization.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">8: Focalization</h3>
                <p><strong><em>Background</em></strong></p>
                <p>Whenever events are presented, it is from within a certain vision. A point of view is chosen, a certain way of seeing or otherwise perceiving things, a certain angle, whether real historical facts or fictitious events are concerned. Storytelling is inevitably slanted or subjective in nature, and to deny this constitutes a dubious political act, for it means denying narrative responsibility. It is of course possible to attempt to give an objective picture of the facts. Objectivity is an attempt to present only what is perceived: all comment is shunned, and implicit interpretation is avoided. Perception, however, is a psychosomatic process that is strongly dependent on the position of the perceiving body; a small child sees things in a totally different way from an adult, if only as far as scale is concerned, but also due to the knowledge and experience that inform understanding. The degree to which one is familiar with what one sees also influences perception.</p>
                <p>Perception depends on so many factors that aiming for objectivity is pointless. To mention only a few factors: one’s position with respect to the perceived object, the angle of the light, the distance, previous knowledge, psychological attitude towards the object – all these things and more affect the picture one forms and passes on to others. Storytelling is one form of such passing on. In a story, elements of the fabula are therefore necessarily presented in a certain way. Through the mediation of the text we are confronted with a vision of the fabula. What is this vision like, and where does it come from? These are the questions that will be discussed in what follows. I will refer to the relations between the elements presented and the vision through which they are presented as <em>focalization</em>. Focalization is, then, the relation between the vision and what is seen, perceived.</p>
                <p><strong><em>The Focalizer</em></strong></p>
                <p>One visual example will clarify the concept at stake in this section. In southern India, at Mahaballipuram, is what is said to be the largest basrelief in the world, the seventh-century <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arjuna’s Penance</em>. At the upper left, the wise man Arjuna is depicted in a yoga position. At the bottom right stands a cat. Around the cat are a number of mice. The mice are laughing. It is a strange image, consisting of disconnected elements – that is, until the spectator interprets the signs. The interpretation runs as follows. Arjuna is in a yoga position and is meditating to win Lord Siva’s favour. The cat, impressed by the beauty of absolute calm, imitates Arjuna. Now the mice realize they are safe. They laugh. Without this interpretation, there is no relation between the parts of the relief. Within this interpretation, the parts form a meaningful narrative.</p>
                <p>The carving is quite funny – an effect evoked by the narrativity of the picture. The spectator sees the relief as a whole. Its contents include a succession in time. First, Arjuna assumes the yoga position; then the cat imitates him; then the mice start laughing. These three successive events are logically related in a causal chain. According to every definition I know, that means this is a fabula.</p>
                <p>But there is more. The events are chronologically in succession and logically in a causal relation. Furthermore, they can only occur through the semiotic activity of the actors. And the comical effect can only be explained when this particular mediation is analysed. We laugh because we can identify with the mice. Seeing what they see, we realize with them that a meditating cat is a contradiction; cats hunt, and only wise men meditate. Following the chain of events in reverse, we also arrive at the next one by perceptual identification: the cat has brought about the event for which he is responsible because he has seen Arjuna do something. This chain of perceptions also runs in time, sequentially: the wise man sees nothing, since he is totally absorbed in his meditation; the cat has seen Arjuna and now sees nothing more of this world;</p>
                <p>(drawing: Fransje van Zoest)</p>
                <p>the mice see the cat and Arjuna, and that is why they know they are safe. Another interpretation is that the cat is pretending, but not really absorbed in meditation; this doesn’t weaken my statements but only adds an element of suspense to the fabula. Indeed, the mice are laughing because of that very fact, finding the imitation a ridiculous enterprise. The spectator sees more. She sees the mice, the cat, and the wise man. She laughs at the cat, and she laughs sympathetically with the mice, whose pleasure is comparable to that felt by a successful scoundrel.</p>
                <p>This example illustrates quite clearly the theory of focalization. Incidentally, it also suggests that, and how, narratological concepts are relevant for the analysis of visual narrative. We can view the bas-relief as a (visual) sign. The elements of this sign – the standing Arjuna, the standing cat, the laughing mice – only have spatial relations to one another. The elements of the fabula – Arjuna assumes a yoga position, the cat assumes a yoga position, the mice laugh – do not form a coherent significance as such. The relations between the sign, the relief, and its contents – the fabula – can only be established through the mediation of an interjacent layer, the <em>vision</em> of the events. The cat sees Arjuna. The mice see the cat. The spectator sees the mice who see the cat who has seen Arjuna. And the spectator sees that the mice are right. Every verb of perception – to see – in this report indicates an activity of focalization. Every verb of action indicates an event.</p>
                <p>Focalization is the relationship between the vision, the agent that sees, and that which is seen. This relationship is a component of the content of the narrative text: A says that B sees what C is doing. Sometimes that difference is void – for example, when the reader is presented with a vision as directly as possible. The different agents then cannot be isolated; they coincide. That is a form of “<span>stream of consciousness</span>”. But the speech act of narrating is still different from the vision, the memories, the sense perceptions, and the thoughts that are being told. And that vision cannot be conflated with the events they focus, orient, interpret. Consequently, focalization belongs in the story, in the layer between the linguistic text and the fabula. Because the definition of focalization refers to a relationship, each pole of that relationship, the subject and the object of focalization, must be studied separately. The subject of focalization, the focalizer, is the point from which the elements are viewed. That point can lie within a character (i.e., it can be an element of the fabula) or outside it.</p>
                <p>If the focalizer coincides with the character, that character will have an advantage over the other characters. The reader watches with the character’s eyes and will, in principle, be inclined to accept the vision presented by that character. Such a character-bound focalizer –which we could label, for convenience’s sake, CF – brings about bias and limitation. In Henry James’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">What Maisie Knew</em> from 1897, the focalization, whenever it is character-bound, lays almost entirely with Maisie, a little girl who understands little about the problematic relations transpiring around her. Consequently, the reader is shown the events through the limited vision of the girl and only gradually realizes what is actually going on. But the reader is not a little girl. He does more with the information he receives than Maisie does; he interprets it differently. Where Maisie sees only a strange gesture, the reader knows he is dealing with an erotic one. The difference between the childish vision of the events and the interpretation the adult reader gives them determines the novel’s special effect. But the narrator is not a child any more than the reader is. In his time, James was perhaps the most radical of experimenters, whose project was to demonstrate that, in the terminology of this book, narrator and focalizer are not to be conflated.</p>
                <p>CF can vary. It can shift from one character to another, even if the narrator remains constant. In such cases, we may be given a good picture of the origins of a conflict. We are shown how differently the various characters view the same facts. This technique can result in neutrality towards all the characters. Nevertheless, there usually is no doubt in our minds which character should receive the most attention and sympathy.</p>
                <p>When focalization lies with one character that participates in the fabula as an actor, we can refer to <em>internal focalization</em>. We can then indicate by means of the term <em>external focalization</em> that an anonymous agent, situated outside the fabula, is functioning as focalizer. Such an external, non-character-bound focalizer is abbreviated EF. In the following fragment from the opening of Doris Lessing’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Summer Before the Dark</em> we see the focalization move from EF to CF.</p>
                <blockquote>b A woman stood on her back step, arms folded, waiting. Thinking? She would not have said so. She was trying to catch hold of something, or to lay it bare so that she could look and define; for some time now she had been “<span>trying on</span>” ideas like so many dresses off a rack. She was letting words and phrases as worn as nursery rhymes slide around her tongue: for towards the crucial experiences custom allots certain attitudes, and they are pretty stereotyped. <em>Ah yes, first love! ... Growing up is bound to be painful! ... My first child, you know ... But I was in love! ... Marriage is a compromise ... I am not as young as I once was</em>.</blockquote>
                <p>From sentence 2 onwards the contents of what the character experiences are given. A switch thus occurs from an external focalizer (EF) to an internal one (CF). An alternation between external and internal focalizers, between EF and CF, is visible in many stories. Also, a number of characters can alternate as CF focalizer; in such cases, it can be useful to indicate the various characters in the analysis by their initials, so that one can retain a clear overview of the division of focalization. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> is an example of a story in which a great many characters act as focalizers. However, the characters do not carry an equal load; some focalize often, others only a little, some do not focalize at all. It is also possible for an entire story to be focalized by an EF. The narrative can then appear objective, because the events are not presented from the point of view of the characters. In such cases the focalizer’s bias is not absent, since there is no such thing as objectivity in storytelling, but it remains implicit.</p>
                <p><strong><em>The Focalized Object</em></strong></p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> Harold is usually the focalizer when the events in the Indies are being focalized; Lot often focalizes his mother, mama Ottilie, and it is mainly because of this that we receive a fairly likeable image of her despite her unfriendly behaviour. The combination of a focalizer and a focalized object can be constant to a large degree (Harold– Indies; Lot–mama Ottilie), or it can vary greatly. Analysis of such fixed or loose combinations matters because the focalizer shapes the image we receive of the object. Conversely, the image a focalizer presents of an object says something about the focalizer itself. Where focalization is concerned, the following questions are relevant.</p>
                <p>1 What does the character focalize: what is it aimed at?</p>
                <p>2 How does it do this: with what attitude does it view things?</p>
                <p>3 Who focalizes it: whose focalized object is it?</p>
                <p>What is focalized by a character F? It need not be a character. Objects, landscapes, events, in short all of the elements are focalized, either by an EF or by a CF. Because of this fact alone, we are presented with a certain interpretation of the elements that is far from neutral or innocent. The degree to which a presentation includes an opinion can, of course, vary: the degree to which the focalizer points out its interpretative activities and makes them explicit also varies. Compare, for instance, the following descriptions of place, both from Dutch 1960s novels:</p>
                <blockquote>c Behind the round and spiny forms around us in the depth endless coconut plantations stretch far into the hazy blue distance where mountain ranges ascend ghostlike. Closer, at my side, a ridged and ribbed violet grey mountainside stretches upward with a sawtooth silhouette combing the white cloudy sky. Dark shadows of the clouds lie at random on the slopes as if capricious dark-grey pieces of cloth have been dropped on them. Close by, in a temple niche, Buddha sits meditating in an arched window of shadow. A dressingjacket of white exudation of bird-droppings on his shoulders. Sunshine on his hands which lie together perfectly at rest. Jan Wolkers, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Kiss</em></blockquote>
                <blockquote>d Then we must first describe heaven, of course. Then the hundreds of rows of angels are clad in glorious shiny white garments. Every one of them has long, slightly curly fair hair and blue eyes. There are no men here. “<span>How strange that all angels should be women</span>”. There are no dirty angels with seductive panties, garterbelts and stockings, not to mention bras. I always pictured an angel as a woman who presents her breasts as if on saucers, with heavily made-up eyes, and a bright red mouth, full of desire, eager to please, in short, everything a woman should be. (Formerly, when I was still a student, I wanted to transform Eve into a real whore. I bought her everything necessary, but she did not want to wear the stuff.) J.M.A. Biesheuvel, “<span>Faust</span>”, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Way to the Light</em></blockquote>
                <p>In both cases, a CF is clearly involved; both focalizers may be localized in the character “<span>L</span>”. In c, the spatial position of the CF (“<span>I</span>”) is especially striking. It is situated on a high elevation, considering the wide prospect it has. The words “<span>around us</span>”, combined with “<span>in the depth</span>”, stress that high position. The proximity of the niche with the Buddha statue makes clear that CF (“<span>I</span>”) is situated in an Eastern temple (the Burubudur, in fact), so that “<span>the round and spiny form</span>” (must) refer to the temple roof. The presentation of the whole – temple roof and landscape – seems fairly impersonal. If the CF (“<span>I</span>”) had not been identified by the use of <em>deixis</em>, through the first-person pronouns in “<span>at my side</span>” and “<span>around us</span>”, this would have seemed, on the face of it, an objective description, perhaps taken from a pamphlet or geography book.</p>
                <p>On closer analysis, this is not the case. Whether the CF (“<span>I</span>”) is explicitly named or not, the internal position of the focalizer is, in fact, already established by expressions such as “<span>close by</span>”, “<span>closer</span>”, and “<span>at my side</span>”, which underline the proximity of the place to the perceiver. “<span>Behind</span>” and “<span>far into</span>” indicate a specification of the spatial perspective in the pictorial sense. But more happens here. Without appearing to do so, this presentation interprets. This is clear from the use of metaphors, which points to the fact that the CF (“<span>I</span>”) is attempting to reduce the objects it sees, which impress it a good deal, to human, everyday proportions. In this way, the CF (“<span>I</span>”) is undoubtedly trying to fit the object into its own realm of experience. Images like “<span>sawtooth</span>”, “<span>combing</span>”, and “<span>capricious dark-grey pieces of cloth</span>”, and cliches like “<span>mountain ranges</span>”, bear this out. “<span>Dressing-jacket of white exudation of bird-droppings</span>” is the clearest example. The image also exhibits an association mechanism. With the word “<span>dressing-jacket</span>”, the Buddha’s statue becomes human, and as soon as it is human, the white layer on its head could easily be dandruff, a possibility suggested by the word “<span>exudation</span>”. The realistic nature of the presentation – CF (“<span>I</span>”) does see the landscape – is restored immediately afterwards by the information about the real nature of the white layer: it is bird droppings. Thus, what we have here is the presentation of a landscape that is realistic, reflecting what is actually perceived and at the same time interpreting the view in a specific way so that the character can assimilate it.</p>
                <p>Example d shows to a certain extent the same characteristics. Here too an impressive space is humanized. However, the CF (“<span>I</span>”) observes the object less and interprets it more. This passage concerns a fantasy object with which the CF (“<span>I</span>”) is sketchily familiar from religious literature and painting, but which it can adapt as much as it wishes, to its own taste. This is what it does, and its taste is clear, and clearly specific, bound to gender. Here too an association mechanism is visible. From the traditional image of angels implied in the second or third sentence, the CF (“<span>I</span>”) moves to the assumption that angels are women. Against the traditional image of asexual male angels, the CF (“<span>I</span>”) sets up, in contrast, its own female image.</p>
                <p>And even before the reader grasps that a link is thus being forged with another tradition – that of the opposition angel-whore, in which “<span>angel</span>” is used in a figurative sense – the word “<span>whore</span>” itself appears in the text. Here the interpretive mode of the description manifests itself clearly. The solemn “<span>we</span>” of the beginning contrasts sharply with the personal turn the description takes. The humour here is based on the contrast between the solemn-impersonal and the personal-everyday. Humour may make one uncomfortable if one is not happy with what is being laughed at or feels excluded, but it is still humour. This suggests a distinction between “<span>inclusive</span>” and “<span>exclusive</span>” humour. The former includes the reader; the latter excludes her. More precisely, the inclusion or exclusion also concerns the focalizer. If this agent appeals to group formation, the reader has the power to accept or reject belonging to the group thus formed.</p>
                <p>The interpretive focalization is emphasized in several ways. The sentence in quotation marks is presented as a reaction to the sentence preceding it. Here, the interpreting focalizer makes an explicit entrance. Later this is stressed again: “<span>not to mention</span>” is a colloquial expression and points at a personal subject, expressing an opinion. “<span>I always pictured an angel as ...</span>” accentuates even more strongly that a personal opinion is involved.</p>
                <p>The way in which an object is presented gives information about the object itself as well as about the focalizer. These two descriptions give even more information about the CF (“<span>I</span>”) than about the objects – more about the way they experience nature (c) or women (d), respectively, than about the Burubudur temple and heaven. In this respect, it doesn’t matter whether the object actually exists or is part of a fictitious fabula, or whether it is a fantasy created by the character and so a doubly fictitious object. In both fragments the comparison with the object referred to served only to motivate the interpretation by the CF (“<span>I</span>”). The internal structure of the descriptions provides in itself sufficient clues about the degree to which one CF (“<span>I</span>”) showed a similarity to and differed from the other.</p>
                <p>These two examples indicate yet another distinction. In c the object of the focalization is perceptible. The CF (“<span>I</span>”) sees something that is outside itself. This is not always the case. An object can also be visible only within the head, mind, or feelings of the CF – all terms that project human features and reactions onto a paper person. And only those who have access to that character’s inside can perceive anything. This perceiver cannot be another character, at least not according to the classical rules of the narrative genre, but it might possibly be an EF. Such a nonperceptible object occurs in cases where, for instance, the contents of a character’s dream are presented. Concerning the heaven in d, we can only learn whether that object is perceptible or not perceptible when we know how the fragment fits into its context. If the “<span>I</span>”, together with another person – a devil, for instance – is on a journey to heaven, then we will have to accept the first part of the description, until the sentence in quotation marks, as perceptible.</p>
                <p>Thus, our criterion is that within the fabula another character should also be able to perceive the object; if such objects are the dreams, fantasies, thoughts, or feelings of a character, then these objects can be part of the category of non-perceptible objects. This distinction can be indicated by adding to the notation of the focalizer a “<span>p</span>” or a “<span>np</span>”. For b we end up with CF (woman)–np; for c, CF (“<span>I</span>”)–p, and, for d, CF (“<span>I</span>”)–np. This distinction too gives insight into the power structure between the characters. When in a conflict situation one character is allotted both CF–p and CF–np, and the other exclusively CF–p, then the first character has the advantage as a party in the conflict. It can give the reader insight into its feelings and thoughts, while the other character cannot communicate anything.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the other character will not have the insight that the reader receives, so that it cannot react to the feelings of the other (which it does not know), cannot adapt itself to them or oppose them. Such an inequality in position between characters is obvious in so-called firstperson novels; in other kinds this inequality is not always as clear to the reader. Yet the latter is manipulated by it in forming an opinion about the various characters. Consequently, the focalization has a strongly manipulative effect. Colette’s 1933 novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cat</em>, already mentioned, provides a strong case: the reader is manipulated, practically by this device alone, into taking the man’s side against his wife.</p>
                <p>In this respect, the point is to keep sight of the difference between the spoken and unspoken words of the characters. Spoken words are audible to others and thus are perceptible when the focalization lies with someone else. Unspoken words – thoughts, internal monologues – no matter how extensive, are not perceptible to other characters. Here too lies a possibility for manipulation, which is often used. Readers are given elaborate information about the thoughts of a character, which the other characters do not hear. When these thoughts are placed between sections of dialogue, readers often do not realize how much less the other character knows than they do. An analysis of the perceptibility of the focalized objects supplies insight into these objects’ relationships.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Levels of Focalization</em></strong></p>
                <p>Compare the following sentences:</p>
                <p>e Mary participates in the rally.</p>
                <p>f I saw that Mary participated in the rally.</p>
                <p>g Michele saw that Mary participated in the rally.</p>
                <p>In all three sentences it is stated that Mary participated in the rally. That is a clearly perceptible fact. We assume that there is an agent which is doing the perceiving and whose perceptions are being presented to the reader. In f this is an “<span>I</span>”, in g it is Michele. In e no party is indicated. Consequently, we assume that there is an external focalizer situated outside the fabula. This could be an EF or a CF (“<span>I</span>”), which remains implicit in this sentence but manifests itself elsewhere. We can thus analyse:</p>
                <p>e EF–p</p>
                <p>f CF(“<span>I</span>”)–p</p>
                <p>g CF (Michele)–p</p>
                <p>The dash indicates the relation between the subject and the object of focalization. However, the difference between these sentences has not yet been expressed completely. Sentences f and g are complex sentences. The focalization, too, is complex. The analysis, as it is given here, only applies to the subordinate clause. In f it is stated that “<span>I</span>” saw, and in g that Michele saw. Who focalized that section? Either an EF or a CF. We can only conclude that from the rest of the story. For f the possibilities are:</p>
                <p>1 EF–[np CF (“<span>I</span>”–p]: an external focalizer focalizes the CF (“<span>I</span>”), which sees. Seeing is a non-perceptible action, in contrast to looking, so the complex focalized object is np. That object consists itself of a focalizer, CF (“<span>I</span>”), which sees something that is perceptible.</p>
                <p>2 CF (“<span>I</span>”)–[np CF (“<span>I</span>”)–p]: a so-called “<span>first person narrative</span>”, in which the external focalizer remembers afterwards that at a certain moment in the fabula, it saw Mary participating in a rally.</p>
                <p>The first possibility exists in theory but will not easily occur, unless the sentence is in direct speech and the CF (“<span>I</span>”) can be identified as one of the persons speaking (temporarily). In g only the first formula is possible: EF–[np CF (Michele)–p]. This is easy to see once we realize that a personal focalizer cannot perceive a non-perceptible object, unless it is part of that object, is the same “<span>person</span>”.</p>
                <p>Two conclusions can be drawn from this. First, it appears that various focalization levels can be distinguished; second, where the focalization level is concerned, there is no fundamental difference between a “<span>firstperson narrative</span>” and a “<span>third-person narrative</span>”. When EF appears to yield focalization to a CF, what is really happening is that the vision of the CF is being given within the all-encompassing vision of the EF. In fact, the latter always keeps the focalization, in which the focalization of a CF may be embedded as object. This too is understandable in terms of the general principles of narratology. When we try to reflect someone else’s point of view, we can only do so insofar as we know and understand that point of view. That is why there is no difference in focalization between a “<span>first-person narrative</span>” and a “<span>third-person narrative</span>”. In a “<span>first-person narrative</span>” too an external focalizer – usually the “<span>I</span>” grown older – gives its vision of a fabula in which it participated earlier as an actor, from the outside. At some moments it can present the vision of its younger alter ego, so that a CF is focalizing on the second level.</p>
                <p>If we wish to include the question of levels in the analysis, we can use an elaborate system of notation, as I have done here. That is useful if we wish to know what the relationship between the various focalizers is like: Who allows whom to watch whom? If, however, we are only concerned with the relationship between the subject and the object of the focalization – for instance, in f between CF (“<span>I</span>”) and Mary, or in g between CF (Michele) and Mary – then it is easier to remind ourselves that we are dealing with an embedded focalization, because at any moment the narrative may return to the first level. In that case, it is simple to indicate the level with a number following the F. For f this would be CF2 (“<span>I</span>”)–p and for g CF2 (Michele)–p.</p>
                <p>Briefly, there is always one sentence that differs from the other two. Thus e differs from f and g in focalization level. Consequently, focalization in e is singular and in f and g it is complex. And e and f differ from g as far as “<span>person</span>” is concerned. In both cases it can be an EF or a CF (“<span>I</span>”). Finally, e and g differ from f because in f an EF cannot simply be assumed without doubt. This is only possible if the sentence is in direct speech.</p>
                <p>We assume, therefore, a first level of focalization (F1) at which the focalizer is external. This external focalizer delegates focalization to an internal focalizer, the focalizer on the second level (F2). In principle, more levels are possible. In these sample sentences it is clear where the focalization is transferred from the first to the second level. The verb form “<span>saw</span>” indicates that. Such markers of shifts in level we call <em>attributive signs</em>. These are signs that indicate the shift from one level to another. These signs can remain implicit. Sometimes we can only deduce them from other, less clear information. In example c, the description of the view on and from the Burubudur, we needed the preceding passage to find the sign with which the shift was indicated explicitly. In d a whole sentence – “<span>Then we must first describe heaven of course</span>” – is used to indicate that the internal CF is now going to give its own vision of heaven. Verbs like “<span>see</span>” and “<span>hear</span>”, in short all verbs that communicate perception, can function as explicit attributive signs.</p>
                <p>There is yet another possibility. The external EF can also watch along with a person, without leaving focalization entirely to a CF. This happens when an object (that a character can perceive) is focalized but nothing clearly indicates whether it is actually perceived. This procedure is comparable to free indirect speech, in which the narrating party approximates as closely as possible the character’s own words without letting it speak directly. An example of such a free indirect focalization – or rather, ambiguous focalization – is the beginning of Chekhov’s story “<span>Lady with Lapdog</span>”:</p>
                <blockquote>h 1 The appearance on the front of a new arrival – a lady with a lapdog – became the topic of general conversation. 2 Dmitri Dmitrich Gurov, who had been a fortnight in Yalta and got used to its ways, was also interested in new arrivals. 3 One day, sitting on the terrace of Vernet’s restaurant, he saw a young woman walking along the promenade; she was fair, not very tall, and wore a toque; behind her trotted a white pomeranian. 4 Later he came across her in the park and in the square several times a day. 5 She was always alone, always wearing the same toque, followed by the white pomeranian, no one knew who she was, and she became known simply as the lady with the lapdog.</blockquote>
                <p>This fragment as a whole is focalized by an external EF. In the third sentence a shift of level takes place, indicated by the verb “<span>to see</span>”. In sentence 4, level 1 has been restored. But in sentence 5 it is ambiguous. This sentence follows the one that states that Dmitri meets the lady regularly.</p>
                <p>According to our expectation, the description of the lady that follows would have to be focalized by that character: cF2 (Dmitri)–p; but there is no indication signalling that change of level. In the second part of the sentence, focalization clearly rests again with EF1. The first part of sentence 5 is focalized both by EF1 and by CF2. Such a double focalization, in which EF “<span>looks over the shoulder</span>” of CF, we may indicate with the double notation EF1/CF2. Such a part of the story might be called a <em>hinge</em>, a fragment with a double or at any rate ambiguous focalization in between two levels. It is also possible to distinguish between <em>double focalization</em>, which can be represented as EF1+CF2, and <em>ambiguous focalization</em>, in which it is hard to decide who focalizes: EF1/CF2. In h this difference cannot be established. In view of the development of the rest of the story, EF1+CF2 seems most likely.</p>
                <p>A special case of focalization, and perhaps the best justification for the distinction I am making, is memory. Memory is an act of “<span>vision</span>” of the past, but as an act, it is situated in the present of the memory. It is often a narrative act: loose elements come to cohere into a story, so that they can be remembered and eventually told. But as is well known, memories are unreliable – in relation to the fabula – and when put into words, they are rhetorically overworked so that they can connect to an audience – for example, a therapist, a judge, a political gathering. Hence, the story the person remembers is not identical to the one she experienced. This discrepancy becomes dramatic and indeed incapacitating in the case of trauma. Traumatic events disrupt the capacity to comprehend and experience them at the time of their occurrence. As a result, the traumatized person cannot remember them; instead, they recur in bits and pieces, in nightmares, and cannot be “<span>worked through</span>”. The incapability that paralyses the traumatized person can be situated on both story and text levels.</p>
                <p>Memory is also the joint between time and space. In stories set in former colonies, memory evokes a past in which people were dislodged from their space by colonizers who occupied it, but also a past in which they did not yield. Going back – in retroversion – to the time in which the place was a different kind of space is a way of countering the effects of colonizing acts of focalization – a process that can be called mapping. Mastering, looking from above, dividing up and controlling is an approach to space that ignores time as well as the density of its lived-in quality. In opposition to such ways of seeing space, providing a landscape with a history is a way of spatializing memory that undoes the killing of space as lived.</p>
                <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Texaco</em>, Patrick Chamoiseau’s fictional or allegorical recuperation of Martinique, the narrator has his converted urban planner say, when he gives up destroying the city to build the road “<span>Penetrante Ouest</span>”:</p>
                <blockquote>Razing Texaco, as I was asked to do, would amount to amputating the city from one part of its future, and especially from the irreplaceable richness of memory. The Creole city, which has so few monuments, becomes a monument itself by virtue of the care it puts into the sites of its memory. The monument, here as in all of America, does not rise up monumentally: it irradiates. 369</blockquote>
                <p>Marginal as the site is, it must be preserved, the former urban planner concludes, because it is the site of memory of the slaves’ art of survival on which this space now bases its future.</p>
                <p>In this passage, “<span>rising up</span>” in monumentality, just as much as the allegorically named road “<span>Penetrante Ouest</span>”, embodies the result of a focalization that is destructive of the past and hence of the future. Irradiation is the alternative way of being of the space that is focalized from within. As Edouard Glissant, a theorist who influenced Chamoiseau’s writing, argued: “<span>the landscape in the work ceases to be merely a decor or a confidant in order to inscribe itself as constitutive of being</span>” (199). This idea of a historically meaningful, heavily political investment of space can help us interpret stories in which a narratological analysis reveals the intricate relationship between characters, time, and space.</p>
                <p>The complexities of narrative depend for their understanding and appreciation on the readers’ ability to sense whose vision it is they are being presented with. This is why distinguishing between levels of focalization is the tool <em>par excellence</em> for generating the literary experience of narratives. By discerning those levels, we sensitize ourselves – get “<span>literate</span>” in – the subtleties of the space between individual and collective experiences, visions, and memories. In Bibliowicz’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Migas de pan</em>, it is of course crucial to distinguish Samuel’s anguished reflections about his father, sequestered in the present, from those transmitted to him by secondary memorization or “<span>postmemory</span>”, through the stories told or withheld by Josue when Samuel was growing up in a house transformed into a museum. But such subtle transitions are not the sole preserve of the postmodern novel. The classical realist novel of the second half of the nineteenth century also excelled in the creation of such complex structures.</p>
                <p>Boleslaw Prus’s 1890 novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lalka</em> (The Doll) is generally considered the greatest Polish novel of the century. It is sometimes compared to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em>. If this comparison is justified, it is despite a reversal: here it is the man who suffers from love and the woman who is cold, callous, and indifferent. What makes the two novels comparable is the mixture of emotional and commercial interests – what we have called, in our updated film based on Flaubert’s novel, “<span>emotional capitalism</span>”, in the wake of Eva Illouz’s sociological studies (2008; 2012). The main character is a successful businessman, Stanislaw Wokulski, who is madly in love with an impoverished woman of noble descent. For seven hundred dense pages these two characters circle each other. The woman, Izabela, is looking to marry both money and status; Stanislaw, who is well regarded in noble circles but remains “<span>only</span>” a businessman, is simply obsessed with Izabela. Many characters of both groups surround him, the “<span>new man of finance</span>”, and her, “<span>the embattled aristocrat</span>” (to recycle the terminology of the cover blurb). They are not shy about applying ethnic, class, and national stereotypes, and women are still seen as weak, fickle, and hysterical. Consider this: “<span>Wokulski, who had never seen a fat peasant …</span>” (409). From Balzac and Dickens to Flaubert and Tolstoy, recognizable scenes succeed one another, with reflections on the temporality of storytelling helping us appreciate the broad tableau.</p>
                <p>In this context, shifts in levels of focalization help us see how the one man whose musings, emotions, and doubts constantly assault him is embedded in a social circle where he stands out as different, yet is just as subject to common views as the others. When an old Baron of his acquaintance who calls Stanislaw his “<span>best friend</span>” (404) introduces him to his fiancee, a young and beautiful girl, Stanislaw seems to see the situation as a comically reversed mirror of his own. Here is a brief sample of the shift from present to retrospective focalization:</p>
                <blockquote>“<span>An amusing story, upon my word</span>”, Wokulski muttered when the Baron had gone, [right after the Baron’s story of his engagement with the woman he calls a “<span>child</span>”] “<span>that old man is really up to his neck in it</span>”.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>And he could not dispel the figure of the Baron, who had looked like a shadow against the amaranthine background of the carriage seat. So he observed the lean face, on which brick-red flushed glowed, his hair which seemed powdered with flour, his large sunken eyes in which an unhealthy gleam flickered. His outburst of passion had made a droll yet mournful impression in a man who kept covering up his throat, checking that the window was tightly shut and continually changed his seat in the compartment for fear of draughts. (400)</blockquote>
                <p>Wokulski’s reflection occurs right after the story has been told to him. The first sentence evaluates the story itself as “<span>amusing</span>” and judges the Baron’s situation. But the next sentences describe not quite the Baron so much as the memory of him. The focalizer seems to still see him, but in a memory. It is phrased in the past tense – “<span>who <em>had</em> looked like a shadow</span>” – but also in spectral terms, as if to account for memory itself. Then we shift back to the present and the concrete reality, just past: here we read that “<span>he observed</span>” and then follows the description of what Wokulski had seen – or rather, how he had seen it. The final part of the passage expresses the restlessness that Wokulski attributes to the Baron’s old age, but to which his own restlessness seamlessly coheres.</p>
                <p>In a preceding scene set in Paris, where Wolkulski travelled, first thinking Izabela would also go there, and then, when she didn’t, to distract himself from her, our hero has some amazing adventures in the course of which people show him tricks as well as miraculous inventions. In the middle of a mad carrousel of sensations, he muses:</p>
                <blockquote>It seemed to him he could see an immense factory, from which emerged new suns, new planets, new species, new nations – but in which there were people and hearts which the Furies were tearing apart – love, hope and pain. (385)</blockquote>
                <p>But the external focalizer warns us beforehand that he is the victim of illusions; all his grandiose dreams of new inventions come to naught when his astounding discoveries mingle with his emotional turmoil (“<span>It <em>seemed</em> to him he <em>could</em> see</span>”). And true enough, soon after this moment “<span>all this made him feel that the moment for a decisive battle between intellect and heart was approaching</span>”. Between the magicians and the alchemists, the tricksters and the scientists, he is enthusiastic – until he is invited to a party that Izabela also attends. As these few passages suggest, this long novel depicts a man incapable of deciding, in a society incapable of letting go of its outdated boundaries.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Suspense</em></strong></p>
                <p>Suspense is a frequent fact of experience, yet difficult to analyse. If we consider suspense as a narrative rhetoric, and define it as the effect of the procedures by which either the reader or the character is made to ask questions that are only answered later, it is possible to achieve some grasp of the various kinds of suspense in terms of focalization.</p>
                <p>It is possible that some questions are solved fairly quickly, while others are shelved. If suspense is to develop, then the questions must be recalled repeatedly and the answers postponed. In the paragraphs dealing with order, I pointed out that suspense can be generated by the announcement of something that will occur later, or by temporary silence concerning information that is needed. In both cases, the image presented to the reader is manipulated. The focalizer presents that image. In principle, that image coincides with the image the focalizer itself has; for this reason, the latter can be compared to a camera.</p>
                <p>But the focalizer’s image can be limited. This is the case when the characters know more than the focalizer. That “<span>knowing more</span>” must, of course, appear later. It is also possible for the focalizer to falsify an image – for instance, by leaving out certain elements, hiding them from the reader. In such a case, the characters also know more than the reader. The focalizer can also be in possession of information that the characters do not know – for instance, about the origins of events. Then the reader, along with the focalizer, knows more than the character. The reader can thus receive an image that is just as complete or incomplete, more complete or less complete than the image the characters have of themselves. The focalizer determines that. If we now attempt to analyse suspense according to the knowledge of reader and character on the basis of information provided through the focalizer, four possibilities emerge.</p>
                <p>When a question is raised (Who did it? What happened? How will it end?), it is possible that neither the reader nor the character can answer it. This is the opening situation of almost every detective novel. It is also possible that the reader does know the answer but that the character does not. The tension, in this case, is different. The question is not what the answer will be but whether the character will discover it for itself in time. This is the suspense that lies at the root of a threat. A character makes a mistake. Will it realize this in time? There is someone standing behind it with an axe. Will it turn around in time? Conversely, it can also be the case that the reader does not know the answer and the characters do, as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em>. The answer can then be gradually revealed, in various phases and by means of various focalizers (Harold, the old people themselves, and the others, each one according to its own knowledge), or in the form of a puzzle, if the information is revealed but is not marked as data, as in a detective novel. When, finally, reader and character are both informed of the answer, there is no suspense.</p>
                <p>Hence, when a question is evoked, the possibilities that the answer is known are thus:</p>
                <p>reader – character – (riddle, detective story, search)</p>
                <p>reader + character – (threat)</p>
                <p>reader – character + (secret, for instance <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em>)</p>
                <p>reader + character + (no suspense)</p>
                <p>In each of these forms of suspense one might analyse in turn, if necessary, which character knows the answer and through which channel of focalization (EF1 or CF2) the reader learns the answer.</p>
                <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Remarks and Sources</h3>
                <p>Most of the topics that have been discussed in this chapter are part of the traditional “<span>theory of the novel</span>”. That term is deceptive for two reasons. First, the novel is probably the most heavily researched textual form. The concepts and distinctions that have emerged from this research usually have a more general scope. Insofar as genre distinctions are taken into account, the novel is in these studies contrasted sometimes with drama, sometimes with poetry, and sometimes with the novella or short story. By using the term “<span>theory of the novel</span>” to indicate sometimes (but not always) a much larger area of narratology, critics have obscured the precise position of the novel with respect to other genres and types of text. So it is sometimes difficult to see to which area distinctions apply.</p>
                <p>Second, the term “<span>theory of the novel</span>” is deceptive because there can be no system as is presupposed by the term “<span>theory</span>”. We have already seen that Muller and his disciples concerned themselves with the temporal relationships in the novel. In Anglo-Saxon countries, work was done at another time, primarily on “<span>point of view</span>” theories. Muller worked with technical, quantitative criteria. The “<span>point of view</span>” theories were based mainly on psychological criteria. It seems difficult to imagine that these two groups of investigators were working on the same theory. Before reference could be made to a theory, all of those different distinctions and concepts had to be brought together in one system.</p>
                <p>One attempt to bring all of the traditional narratological distinctions together within one systematic, theoretical framework was Genette’s “<span>Discours du recit</span>”, the larger part of his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Figures III</em> (1972). Here, the author brought together the different time aspects and focalization within one frame, in which he also placed the narrative text. The highly different origins of the various aspects made it difficult to allot them all a place in a systematic theory of the story level, which Genette did not distinguish from the text level. I have tried to solve this problem by retaining a clear point of departure: the question of how information about the fabula is shaped and presented to the reader. The more technical aspects, such as various time aspects, could be placed within this framework, but so could aspects such as the image of a character and space. Here the questions are specified: What kind of information do we get? How do we get it? How do the various elements and aspects function in relation to one another?</p>
                <p>That last question – How do the elements and aspects function? – is finally determined by focalization. Focalization has an overarching position with respect to the other aspects. The significance of certain aspects cannot be viewed unless it is linked to focalization. Moreover, focalization is, in my view, the most important, most penetrating, and subtlest means of manipulation. Analyses of newspaper reports that aim at revealing the hidden ideology embedded in such reports should involve focalization in their investigations, and not restrict themselves to so-called content analysis – that is, the semantic analysis of content.</p>
                <p>Much of the content of this chapter is compatible with Herman (2002 and 2013). Herman affiliates himself with the school of so-called cognitive narratology (Herman, ed. 2003; Herman, Jahn, and Ryan, eds. 2005). While I am a bit weary of the scientific language, I find Herman’s books clear, comprehensive, and rich in analyses. I am not always convinced by his distinctions, but I find that they contribute seriously to our more sophisticated understanding of narrative. I have similar doubts about the so-called psychological approach to narratology, where I have found less relevant proposals for analysis (Bortolussi and Dixon 2003).</p>
                <p>I have made remarks here and there, and especially in this chapter, concerning the relationship between fiction and reality. I have not devoted a special section to this issue, because it is not narratological per se. Instead of seeing in every narrative a representation of reality – a reading posture than leads to flat, realistic judgments – I have insisted that this relationship is important as a tool for critique. I have used the concept of makebelieve with reference to Kendall L. Walton’s book on fictionality (1990). Walton’s study is limited to representational art and thus tends to stay closer to questions of realism than I do. But within that self-chosen limitation, it is the most useful take on this issue that I know of.</p>
                <p>The theory of anachrony has been further developed since Lammert in 1955 first made an extensive study of it. The most systematic exposition of this subject, and of the other time aspects as well, has been Genette’s, just mentioned. Genette considered every variation on a set pattern a (rhetorical) figure – an attitude reflected in the title of his book: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Figures III</em>. Within the framework of that theory, it is understandable that he sought to express such figures in terms that would fit into terminology derived from Greek rhetoric. Since such terms, which do indeed have advantages, appear rather cryptic and, consequently, tend to repel, I attempted to avoid them, and at most mentioned them in conjunction with English terms, unless no adequate English term could be found.</p>
                <p>Actually, Genette’s terms are not really as difficult as they appear, because they have been systematically constructed out of several prepositions and word stems. For those who wish to use them in further analysis, it is perhaps useful to know how they are structured. The prepositions are <em>ana</em> and <em>pro</em>, which mean, respectively, “<span>towards/from the back</span>” and “<span>towards/in the front</span>”. <em>Para</em> means “<span>to the side</span>”. The stem -<em>lips</em> means “<span>leaving something out</span>” and -<em>leps</em>, “<span>adding something</span>”. Thus we end up with, for instance, <em>paralips</em> in the sense of “<span>something is left out on the side (a missing side-track)</span>”, and <em>paraleps</em>: “<span>something is added to the side</span>”. For Genette’s complete time theory, I refer the reader to the English translation of his work (1980).</p>
                <p>Barbara Herrnstein Smith long ago cautioned against the presupposition that the fabula pre-exists the story (1980). The paradox of the distinction has been further theorized by Culler (1981) in psychoanalysis and the mystery novel. Although I maintain the distinction, I fully agree with these analyses of the problem inherent in it. An important book article by Hamon (1983), from which I have borrowed a great deal in this chapter, deals with characters. Hamon treats the most important aspects of the characters and places them in a semiotic framework. His division of the characters into signifier and signified I find a bit problematic.</p>
                <p>Booth discusses the unreliable narrator (1961). The best-known study of space is still the philosophically and psychoanalytically tinted <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Poetics of Space</em> by Bachelard (1957). Uspenskij (1973) broaches interesting aspects of this problem. Lodge (1977) discusses a series of location descriptions, which are, in his view, progressively more poetic.</p>
                <p>An important philosophical study of space is Lefebvre (1991). De Lauretis (1983) offers a feminist critique of Lotman’s (1977) semiotic interpretation of space. Many studies use the distinction between place and space in a sense that I have reversed here. The reason for my reversal is that place, in narrative, equals location, the topological specification of where things happen, whereas space fleshes out the specific look and feel of that place, like the setting of a film or theatre play. But the reverse is just as arguable. For important narratological analyses of space/place, see Hoving (2001). A wonderfully inspiring social-scientific view of space is offered by Michel de Certeau (1984).</p>
                <p>Friedman’s typology of narrative points of view (1955) is based on various criteria (amount of information, “<span>perspective</span>”, identity and attitude of the narrator) and is, consequently, less systematic than could be wished. The same goes for Booth’s well-known fifth chapter. Both contain, however, a good many interesting insights. The distinction between narration and focalization was introduced by Genette (1972). For a critical discussion, and a theoretical justification of the ideas presented here, see Bal (1991). A good survey of narratology, one that is also based on a (somewhat different) distinction of three layers and that discusses focalization and character in interesting ways, is provided by Rimmon-Kenan (1983). A study that presents a thorough overview and analysis of many of the subjects of this chapter, albeit with a different terminology, was published by Fludernik (1996). Also different, but especially relevant for the historicizing aspect of focalization and narration, is Rimmon-Kenan (1996). For a clear exposition on memory and trauma in relation to narrative incapacitation, see Van Alphen (1997), especially chapter 2 and his contribution to Bal, Crewe, and Spitzer (1999), on the whole a useful collection. The term “<span>postmemory</span>” has been introduced by Marianne Hirsch and is widely used, although it easily lends itself to misunderstandings. For a discussion, see Van Alphen (2006) and Hirsch (2008).</p>
