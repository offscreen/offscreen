                </header>
                <p>As said, a narrative text is a text in which a narrative agent tells a story. In this chapter, I further explain the different aspects of this definition and their consequences for the analysis and interpretation of narrative. The first question is that of the identity and status of the narrative agent. When, in this chapter, I discuss the narrative agent, or narrator, I mean the (linguistic, visual, cinematic) subject, a function and not a person, which expresses itself in the language or images that constitute the text. This agent is not the (biographical) author of the narrative. The narrator of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Emma</em> is not Jane Austen. The historical person Jane Austen is not without importance for literary history, but the circumstances of her life are of no consequence to the specific discipline of narratology. In order to keep this distinction in mind, I shall here and there refer to the narrator as “<span>it</span>”. In this chapter, I keep to the definition of “<span>that agent which utters the (linguistic or other) signs which constitute the text</span>”.</p>
        <p>The appeal to the author to authenticate interpretations is an argument of authority – the two words “<span>author</span>” and “<span>authority</span>” are not coincidentally linked. But to confer all interpretive power to the reader also has its problems. The reader is surely indispensable in an interactive view of narrative. But the reader is neither alone in this, nor omnipotent. The social embedding of reading, the cultural commonplaces that influence how we read, make the individualistic view that each reader does it all, untenable. The first question this definition raises is that of the status and identity of the narrative agent.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">2: The Narrator</h3>
        <p>The identity of the narrator, the degree to which and the manner in which that identity is indicated in the text, and the choices that are implied lend the text its specific character. This topic is closely related to the notion of focalization. Narrator and focalization together determine the <em>narrative situation</em>. The focalizer, as this concept will be defined in chapter 2, is an aspect of the story this narrator tells. It is the represented colouring of the fabula by an agent of perception, the holder of the point of view. When we see focalization as part of narration, as is usually done, we fail to make a distinction between linguistic, visual, or auditive, hence, textual agents and the colouring, the object of their activity, which may be produced by a different agent.</p>
        <p>The fact that narration implies focalization is related to the notion that language shapes vision and world view. Distinguishing layers leads to the conclusion that seeing, taken in the widest sense of perception and interpreting, constitutes the <em>object</em> of narrating. When the connection between these two agents is not self-evident, it becomes easier to gain insight into the complexity of the relationship between the three agents that function in the three layers – the narrator, the focalizer, the actor – and those moments in which they do or do not overlap in the shape of a single “<span>person</span>”.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Forms of Narration: “<span>I</span>” and “<span>He</span>” Are Both “<span>I</span>”</em></strong></p>
        <p>Traditionally, narratives have been called, according to the “<span>voice</span>” of the narrator, “<span>first-person</span>” or “<span>third-person</span>” novels, with an exceptional “<span>second-person</span>” experiment. To what does the distinction between first-person and third-person novels correspond? Let us first consider an example that will return in chapter 2: the beginning of the novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People or Things that Pass</em> (1906) by Dutch naturalist novelist Louis Couperus (1863–1923). In it, a woman, Ottilie, hears the voice of her estranged husband, Steyn:</p>
        <p>a Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule.</p>
        <p>In this sentence we distinguish:</p>
        <p>1 An event in a (in this case fictitious) fabula: the sounding of a voice belonging to Steyn.</p>
        <p>2 Someone who hears the voice resound, who is sensitive to the timbre of that voice and to the specific (hollow) resonance that sounds acquire in a vestibule.</p>
        <p>3 A speaking agent that names the event and its perception.</p>
        <p>The speaking agent does not mention itself in the process. It might just as well have done so. Then we would have read: “<span>(I narrate:) Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule</span>”. As soon as there is language, there is a speaker who utters it; as soon as those linguistic utterances constitute a narrative text, there is a narrator, a narrating subject. From a grammatical point of view, this narrating subject is always a “<span>first person</span>”. In fact, the term “<span>third-person narrator</span>” is absurd: a narrator is not a “<span>he</span>” or “<span>she</span>”. At best the narrator can narrate about someone else, a “<span>he</span>” or “<span>she</span>” – who might, incidentally, happen to be a narrator as well. This does not imply that the distinction between “<span>first-person</span>” and “<span>third-person</span>” narratives is itself invalid. Just compare the following sentences:</p>
        <p>b I will be twenty-one tomorrow.</p>
        <p>c Elizabeth will be twenty-one tomorrow.</p>
        <p>If what I said above is valid, we may rewrite both sentences as:</p>
        <p>(I say:) I will be twenty-one tomorrow.</p>
        <p>(I say:) Elizabeth will be twenty-one tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Both sentences are uttered by a speaking subject, an “<span>I</span>”. The difference lays in the object of the utterance. In b the “<span>I</span>” speaks about itself. In c the “<span>I</span>” speaks about someone else. When in a text the narrator never refers explicitly to itself as a character, we speak of an <em>external</em> narrator. This term indicates that the narrating agent does not figure in the fabula as an actor. On the other hand, if the “<span>I</span>” is to be identified with a character, hence, also an actor in the fabula, we speak of a <em>character-bound</em> narrator.</p>
        <p>This difference between an external and a character-bound narrator, a narrator that tells about others and a narrator that tells about him- or herself – such a narrator is personified – entails a difference for the narrative rhetoric of truth. A character-bound narrator usually proclaims or implies that it is recounting true facts about her- or himself. “<span>It</span>” pretends to be writing “<span>her</span>” autobiography, even if the fabula is blatantly implausible, fantastic, absurd, metaphysical. Julio Cortazar’s famous short story “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Axolotl</span>” tells us “<span>in the first person</span>” how the narrator changed into an <em>axolotl</em>, a kind of lizard. This form enables him to explore from the inside what it means to (not) be human. The narrative form sets up a confrontation between the limits of a sense of humanity confined to the individual and the recognition by others that defines it. The narrative rhetoric of a character-bound narrator is therefore here indicated by the addition:</p>
        <p>(I narrate: (I state autobiographically:)) I felt a great anxiety that day.</p>
        <p>The rhetoric of an external narrator can also be used to present a story about others as true. We may indicate this as follows:</p>
        <p>(I narrate: (I testify:)) Elizabeth felt a great anxiety that day.</p>
        <p>Unless otherwise indicated, there is no reason to doubt that the character did feel that anxiety. On the other hand, the rhetoric sometimes points to invention. Indications that the narrator is telling a fictive story and wants the readers to know it is producing narrations of impossible or unknowable situations; or generic indications such as “<span>Once upon a time ...</span>”, which is often present at the beginning of a fairy tale, and subtitles such as “<span>A Novel</span>” or “<span>A Winter’s Tale</span>” – these indications suggest fictionality. The fabula is fictitious, invented, an instance of the child’s play of make-believe.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Point of this Distinction</em></strong></p>
        <p>Let me illustrate this with three examples involving children. Compare the following passage from a children’s book about a family accident in which the mother is so badly hurt that – after the quoted passage – she will die. The older daughter, who is about eight, narrates:</p>
        <blockquote>But this afternoon I hate it all. They don’t know I dreamed about Mum, and why. What <em>do</em> they know? The same as I do? <em>Say</em> it then! I start yelling and calling names. Then I’m so ashamed that I creep away under the blankets. I hate everybody.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Arno Bohlmeijer, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Something Very Sorry</em>, 110</blockquote>
        <p>This moving story is actually a true, that is, non-fictional account, written by the father, not the girl who is the speaking “<span>I</span>” here. But the narrator emphatically claims to speak the truth, which is indicated by the emphasis on problems of access – “<span>What <em>do</em> they know?</span>” – and by the honesty with which she gives away her shame over her obnoxious behaviour. As a consequence, the reader not only believes her but also understands her behaviour, better than she can herself.</p>
        <p>Now, the following two passages come from an autobiographical book; yet the narrator has a different, though equally truthful rhetoric:</p>
        <blockquote>We were sitting in a cornfield waiting for the sun to set. Mother, Daddy, and I and our guides, a man and a woman who had given us directions from the train station. Susan Rubin Suleiman, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Budapest Diary</em>, 3</blockquote>
        <blockquote>In the taxi to our hotel, all I could think about was that I was in a city where even the cabdrivers spoke Hungarian. Once he found out I spoke the language and had lived in Budapest, our driver started firing questions. 19</blockquote>
        <p>The first of these passages is the beginning of the book; the second opens the second chapter.</p>
        <p>The author is the same, Suleiman. The narrators are different. From the language of the first passage we can assume the narrator is a child. The name “<span>Daddy</span>” tells us that, as does the reference to the guides as “<span>a man and a woman</span>”, without proper names. The information we get about the narrator implies much more. The interpreter can speculate about the familial relationships suggested by the difference between “<span>Mother</span>” and “<span>Daddy</span>”, especially in light of the book’s intriguing subtitle, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">In Search of the Motherbook</span>”. The narrator of the second passage is an adult, or at least, someone whose knowledge of Hungarian was not obvious from the start (“<span>Once he found out I spoke the language</span>”). This anecdote tells us that the narrator was at first assumed to be a foreigner in Budapest.</p>
        <p>The first passage, although not saying anything about language, suggests that the child narrator is in her own country, Hungary. As the narrator soon tells us, Hungarian was her mother tongue as a child; she lost it, and got it back as a foreign language. In fact, the book is very much focused on this particular way of being “<span>in language</span>”. The subtitle beautifully reflects this focus: “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Motherbook</span>” is a literal translation of the Hungarian word for a birth certificate. Given the narrator’s double status as a former native and now foreign speaker, the word has the music of the childhood in which, precisely, she is no more. The distinction between author and narrator is crucial for reading this book: the issue the story addresses is, precisely, the way language splits the subject – a general idea in post-structuralism, and one that is particularly dramatic in the case of this subject’s relation to a language acquired, lost, and (partly) regained.</p>
        <p>Yet another example of a child narrator shows that the autobiographical claim implied in character-bound narration (CN) can have vastly different implications.</p>
        <blockquote>I drop the food and break into pieces she took my face away there is no one to want me to say my name ...</blockquote>
        <blockquote>I see her face which is mine. ... I have to have my face ... I follow her we are in the diamonds which are her earrings now my face is coming I have to have it I am looking for the join ... now I am her face my own face has left me ... I want to be the two of us ... I want the join. Toni Morrison, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beloved</em>, 212–13</blockquote>
        <p>This narration of an experience is, at first sight, so strange that for that reason alone we do not doubt its veracity. The mixture of fusion with the mother and the fragmentation of the self, reminiscent of another tenet of the same psychoanalytic theory to which Suleiman’s narrators related, speaks of the early infant’s lack of a formed ego. This general idea is here inflected in the historical tragedy of slavery. The fragmentation and fusion that inhibit the formation of subjectivity are used to represent the difficulty of remembering a traumatic past – that of slavery, in turn represented in the most painful of its experiences, the impossibility of mother–child relationships under such conditions. The difficulty of remembering that comes with trauma is, metaphorically, embodied in the difficulty of re-membering the body, the face.</p>
        <p>These three examples of a CN, that is, of an “<span>I</span>” identifiable as a character doing the narrating, imply a rhetoric of veracity.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">All Kinds of “<span>I</span>”s</em></strong></p>
        <p>Compare the following passages, of which only d is from a literary novel, Louis Couperus’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em>, already mentioned. This widely read novel, turned into a film and a television series, can be considered a typically Dutch variant of Naturalism: hereditary flaws persevere through three generations, guilt is connected with passion, and violence is staged in both “<span>the Indies</span>” (now Indonesia) and The Hague. The “<span>old people</span>” are more and more haunted by the murder of the old woman’s husband that they committed sixty years ago in the Indies, while the secret, after all these years, becomes more and more in danger of revelation.</p>
        <p>Couperus (1863–1923) grew up as one of many children in a family of colonial administrators. His father was severe and demanding, and the child was bound to disappoint him. The family spent several years in the Indies. His many works include psychological novels, symbolic fairy tales, mythological novels, historical novels (often set in a decadent society), short stories, travel accounts, and journalism. His recurrent theme is the predominance of fate in human life. Fate, in Couperus’s view, is an almost personified, basically obscure force, impregnated with guilt. The stereotypical opposition between the north, as cold, somber, male, and bourgeois, and south, as sensual and female, structures many of his novels. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> is, in my view, his best novel. Now, compare the following passages:</p>
        <p>d Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule. Come Jack, come dog, come along with your boss! Are you coming? The happy bark of the terrier resounded. Up and down on the stairs he stormed with his enthusiastic speed, as if tripping over his own paws. Oh, that voice of Steyn’s! mama Ottilie hissed between her teeth, and she angrily turned the pages in her book.</p>
        <p>e I sat quietly dozing in the room. But, again, I was not allowed to remain so. Hardly had I sat there five minutes when there it was again. Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule. Oh, that voice of Steyn’s!</p>
        <p>f One day a gentleman, whom I shall, for simplicity’s sake, call Steyn, went for a walk with his dog, while his wife sat dozing in the room. Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule. She started at his voice, because she was very sensitive to sounds. Oh, that voice of Steyn’s!</p>
        <p>g Though Steyn assured me repeatedly that he only went out to walk his dog, his wife remained convinced that he kept a mistress. Every time he went out, she was irritated. One day it happened again. Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule. Oh, that voice of Steyn’s!</p>
        <p>If we compare the relationship between the narrative “<span>I</span>” and what is narrated in these four fragments, we can contrast d and f with e and g. The “<span>I</span>”, the narrative subject in d and f, is not a character in the story it narrates, while the narrator of e and g is also a character. Looking at example a, we note that this sentence recurs unchanged in all four fragments. In each we have:</p>
        <p>1 a speaking agent, which mentions the event and its perception</p>
        <p>2 someone who hears the sound of that voice, and – it appears – is Irritated</p>
        <p>3 an event in a fabula: the sounding of Steyn’s voice</p>
        <p>In d, as we can say now that we have full information, the voice belongs to the character Steyn; the perception, that is, the irritation, belongs to Steyn’s wife Ottilie (a character-bound focalizer); and the speaking agent is an external narrator. Since we are dealing with a novel, we expect that the fabula is invented, but this is of minor importance here. Now we can interpret the sentence like this: (I narrate: (I invent: (Ottilie focalizes:))) Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule. If we want to indicate briefly how the sentence works, we might also formulate it like this: [external narrator [character-bound focalizer (Ottilie) Steyn]. The narrator, the focalizer, and the actor are each of a different identity: the narrator is external, the focalizer is Ottilie, and the actor is Steyn.</p>
        <p>In e we apparently have a narrator whose intention it is to relate the events of her own life in a story that will explain its eventual outcome – let us assume a divorce. We may interpret the sentence like this: (I narrate: (I state autobiographically in order to explain:)) Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule. This sentence relates the event caused by the actor Steyn, its perception by the focalizer “<span>I</span>”, and the narrative act by the narrator “<span>I</span>”; both those “<span>I</span>”s are called Ottilie. Thus we have, here in a formula of condensation that may be useful for quick notation: CN (Ott.) [CF (Ott.)-Steyn]. Two of the three agents have the same name and the same identity.</p>
        <p>In f the situation is different again. The word “<span>I</span>” appears in the text. The narrator names itself. But it is not a character in the fabula. Still, it does more than just refer to its identity as an “<span>I</span>”. A sentence like “<span>because she is very sensitive to sounds</span>” presents itself as an explanation that might even denote partiality. The sensitivity mentioned might constitute an accusation of Steyn, who takes insufficient account of it. On the other hand, it can be an accusation of Ottilie, who is hypersensitive. Let me, temporarily, choose the first interpretation. Then we have, as I will explain in the next chapter, a case of double focalization, that of the anonymous focalizer, which may be located with or in the narrative agent, and that of the character to which it is partial: an external focalizer who embeds the focalization of Ottilie who focalizes Steijn; in abbreviation: EF [CF (Ott.)]-Steyn. Or, with an indication of the levels of focalization: on the first level an external focalization that embeds a character-bound focalizer on the second level, who focalizes Steijn, or EF1 [cF2 (Ott.)]-Steyn. The fact that the focalization cannot reside exclusively with the external narrator is apparent from the sentence that follows “<span>Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule</span>”: “<span>Ottilie startled at the sound of Steyn’s voice</span>”. Supposing again that this fragment is taken from a novel, we take it as fictional. But the narrator may be in the process of explaining such situations in that novel in more general terms, hence the partiality signalled above. Thus we have: (I narrate (I invent with the intention to explain:)) Steyn’s deep bass sounded in the vestibule.</p>
        <p>I now take into account the fact that the narrator manifests itself in its text, refers to itself as “<span>I</span>”; while also thinking of the fact that that “<span>I</span>” is not a character, not an actor as in e. This I indicate by the addition of the term “<span>perceptible</span>” or “<span>non-perceptible</span>”, by which I mean perceptible or non-perceptible as specifically mentioned by the narrating agent in the text. The shorthand for that sentence might then be: EN(np) [EF1 [cF2 (Ott.)]-Steyn(p)]. Thus there is a partial coincidence of two of the three agents, while there are still three different identities at play. This form occurs quite frequently in older literature, such as Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Balzac, Dickens, and also Cervantes’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Don Quixote</em> (from 1605 and 1615). It often serves to state a truth claim – the best guarantee of fictionality.</p>
        <p>In the beginning of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Don Quixote</em> we read: “<span>But this does not much concern our story; enough that we do not depart by so much of an inch from the truth in the telling of it</span>” (31). A bit later, the narrator claims to be the most truthful among his competitors by giving several versions of a fact (37). This goes so far as to turn the truth claim completely around: in chapter 5 a tale, which is disqualified as coming from the kind of literature the novel consistently ridicules, is thus framed by the EN(p):</p>
        <blockquote>a tale familiar to children, not unknown to youth, and enjoyed and even believed by old men, though for all that no truer than the miracles of Mahomet. 53</blockquote>
        <p>This position of the witness may be less crucial to the fabula but can be key for the reader. A witness can convey compassion, irony, or other affective responses to the reader. A witness can also influence the veracity of the narrative. Hence, neither the quantitative presence nor the participation in the fabula determines the importance of a particular type of narrator.</p>
        <p>The narrator as witness is found in many literary, cinematic, and other narratives. The narrator can thereby remain invisible, yet committed to the story it tells. It can also be used as a readerly device. Considering the narrative as told by a witness is a way of barring indifference and encouraging compassion. This, in turn, solicits questions of modesty versus voyeurism, or a resistance to an attitude of appropriation, hence, questions of an ethical nature.</p>
        <p>However, focalization need not remain with the same agent. Technically it would even be almost impossible to maintain such continuity. A spectacular example of a novel in which narration rests from beginning to end with the EN(np), and focalization with the CF, is Alain Robbe- Grillet’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La jalousie</em> (1957). It is curious that precisely the consistency with which the technique is maintained has had the effect that almost all critics have termed that anonymous agent a specific character: a jealous husband. Of course, the title has also been of influence here.</p>
        <p>Let’s return to that irritating voice. In g the narrator is also an actor; there is reference to discussions between the actor Steyn and the agent referring to him- or herself as “<span>I</span>”. The actor “<span>I</span>”, which, from the point of view of identity, coincides with the narrator, is, however, not important for the action. It stands apart, observes the events, and relates the story according to its point of view. Such a narrator is a witness. The question whether the story it tells is invented can no longer be asked. The text is full of indications that the story must be considered “<span>true</span>”. Of course, this does not mean it is factually true; it merely speaks for the implied claim of the narrator. The interpretation of this sentence is:</p>
        <p>(I narrate: (I witness:)) Steyn’s deep bass resounded in the vestibule.</p>
        <p>Since the narrator so is clearly pretending to testify, it must also, supposedly, make clear how it got its information. In the first sentence of g it does so: its source, at that moment, is Steyn himself. With regard to the rest of the fragment we cannot tell. Perhaps Ottilie has told the narrator this anecdote. If not, it seems self-evident to presuppose that the narrator/character-witness was present at the scene.</p>
        <p>If this is the case, then focalization is localized with the characterbound narrator who refers to herself and is, therefore, perceptible in the text. Now Ottilie has disappeared as an agent, and both narration and focalization rest with the perceptible external narrator, the anonymous witness who is yet an “<span>I</span>”.</p>
        <p>In these examples we have seen four different narrative situations. In d and f the narrator stood outside the fabula and in e and g it did not. In d the focalizer was a character. In f we considered a case of embedded focalization, since here we saw an infiltration of external agents into the story. In e the identification of the agents was closest: the narrator and the focalizer were both the character Ottilie. In g, finally, narrator and focalizer coincided – however, unlike e, not in the identity of one of the active actors, but in the identity of a witness. With these analyses, the fundamental distinction between a narrative “<span>I</span>” that talks about itself and a narrative “<span>I</span>” that speaks of others turns out to be too general. The implication of the narrator in one or both of the other layers is an aspect to consider.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the narrative “<span>I</span>” exclusively narrates, as in d; it can also perceive, as in e, f, and g; and it can also act, as in e and g. When it acts, this action may remain limited to testimony, as in g. The traditional distinction between “<span>I</span>”-narratives and “<span>he</span>”-narratives is thus inadequate not only for terminological reasons. The difference between d and f would remain inarticulate because the infiltration of the “<span>I</span>” into the story is neglected. In some narratives, the narrative situations analysed here – that is, the different relationships of the narrative “<span>I</span>” to the object of narration – are constant within each narrative text. This means that one can immediately, already on the first page, see which is the narrative situation. But the narrative situation can also change. Displacements occur especially between d and f. A narrator may remain imperceptible for a long time, but suddenly begin to refer to itself, sometimes in such a subtle manner that the reader hardly notices. Yet, a sense of presence emerges – the presence of a witness.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Second-Person Narrators?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Michel Butor’s novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em> (1957) is one of the rare examples of a novel consistently written “<span>in the second person</span>”. In the beginning, that grammatical form hampers the smooth narrative reading commonly associated with the genre. But quite soon it is almost inevitable that the narrative takes over, and one can sit back and go along with the adventures of the protagonist on his train ride between Paris and Rome, between his wife and his lover.</p>
        <p>The narrative thrust of this novel seems to depend on the fact that the second person cannot be sustained; without much effort, the reader translates it into first-person format, which enables her to read on and process the text into a story. The “<span>you</span>” cannot be subsumed by the reader’s position, nor can it be construed as the addressee of apostrophe, as in lyrical poetry. The “<span>you</span>” is simply an “<span>I</span>” in disguise, a “<span>first-person</span>” narrator talking to himself; the novel is a “<span>first-person</span>” narrative with a formal twist to it that does not engage the entire narrative situation, as one would expect it should. The novel has the appearance of a socalled interior monologue, that equally artificial mode of narration “<span>in the first person</span>” – with a character-bound narrator – that seeks to eliminate reference to the first-person voice in favour of a silent, “<span>pure</span>” firstperson focalizer.</p>
        <p>There is a reason for this easing back into the traditional narrative from which the author had sought to estrange his readers. This relapse is a consequence of Butor’s failure to take seriously what the second person is: to be, to act out, the essence of language. Only when speech is addressed to a second person can language fulfil its mission to communicate. This is the nature of words called <em>deixis</em>: words that only have meaning in the context in which they are uttered, such as “<span>I</span>” and “<span>you</span>”, “<span>yesterday</span>”, “<span>here</span>” or “<span>there</span>”. According to French linguist Emile Benveniste, who gave currency to the importance of deixis, the essence of language lies in deixis, not reference, because what matters in language is not the world “<span>about</span>” which subjects communicate, but the constitution of the subjectivity required to communicate in the first place. This idea illustrates beautifully the crossing of individual and social others that makes the case for the cultural importance of narrative.</p>
        <p>The pronouns “<span>I</span>” and “<span>you</span>”, as opposed to “<span>she</span>”, “<span>he</span>”, “<span>they</span>”, and the like, are empty in themselves. They do not refer outside of the situation in which they are uttered. Each utterance is performed by an “<span>I</span>” and addressed to a “<span>you</span>”. This second person is crucial, for it is that subject that confirms the “<span>I</span>” as a speaker. Conversely, the “<span>you</span>” becomes an “<span>I</span>” as soon as the perspective shifts. It is only as (potential) “<span>I</span>” that the “<span>you</span>” him- or herself has the subjectivity to act, hence, to confirm the subjectivity of the previous “<span>I</span>”.</p>
        <p>What is lacking, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em>, is the key feature of <em>deixis</em>: the reversibility, the exchange, of the first and second person. Not only is the “<span>you</span>” a clearly distinct, even semantically dense individual doing certain things, but the other people in his life, hence, in the fabula, are consistently described in the third person. The “<span>you</span>” is cut off from the others, or cuts them off, so that, rather than mutually confirming one another’s subjectivity, the figure of this “<span>you</span>” lapses into monologism. The pronoun “<span>you</span>” becomes a reminder of the alienation, that recession of subjectivity, rather than a fulfilment of it. As a consequence, the “<span>you</span>” can never be identified with the reader, nor is the reader the “<span>you</span>”‘s symmetrical counterpart, the “<span>I</span>”. There is simply no “<span>you</span>” here whose turn-taking will make the written “<span>you</span>” into an “<span>I</span>”. I contend, therefore, that Butor has based his novel on a misconception of deixis. To extend this conclusion further, second-person narrators are not only logically impossible but also not manageable for a reader. For it is the latter who is narrative’s “<span>second person</span>”.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">3: Non-Narrative Comments</h3>
        <p>Not every sentence in a narrative text can be called “<span>narrative</span>” according to the definitions presented in this book. Sometimes it is worthwhile analysing the alternation between narration and non-narrative comments. Often, it is in such comments that ideological statements are made. This is not to say that the rest of the narrative is “<span>innocent</span>” of ideology– on the contrary. The reason for examining these alternations is precisely to measure the difference between the text’s overt ideology, as stated in such comments, and its more hidden or naturalized ideology, as embodied in the narrative representations.</p>
        <p>The following excerpt from an old-fashioned Dutch children’s book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Danny Goes Shopping</em> by L. Roggeveen, presents a fairly obvious case. It shows that the commentary of the external narrator may far exceed the function of narrating.</p>
        <p>1 Danny is barely able to hear him above the music.</p>
        <p>2 What is the matter? he thinks.</p>
        <p><em>3 Wide-eyed, he looks about him</em>.</p>
        <p><em>4 Then he understands everything!</em></p>
        <p><em>5 There they come, arm in arm, with happy faces: Mr Alexander and Miss Ann!</em></p>
        <p>6 Mr Alexander is a poet.</p>
        <p>7 In his life, he has already written many rhymes.</p>
        <p>8 He has written a poem about Danny, one about currant bread; one about the singing of the nightingale in the silent wood; and more than seven about Miss Ann!</p>
        <p>9 Why did Miss Ann get so many poems?</p>
        <p>10 Well, that is not difficult to guess!</p>
        <p>11 Because Mr Alexander loves Miss Ann so much!</p>
        <p>12 And, fortunately, Miss Ann loves Mr Alexander just as much!</p>
        <p>13 What do two people who love each other do?</p>
        <p>14 Well, that also is not difficult to guess!</p>
        <p>15 They get married! Of course! They did in the past, they do so now, and they always will!</p>
        <p>16 Mr Alexander and Miss Ann act just like all other people.</p>
        <p>17 And today is their wedding day!</p>
        <p>18 The mayor is waiting for the pair in the town hall.</p>
        <p>We can summarize the fabula of this page as follows: Danny watches the arrival of a bridal pair. Focusing on the actors and their actions, I would summarize what Danny sees as: the bridal pair arrives, the mayor is waiting. A lot disappears in this summary. Analysing what, exactly, helps distinguish between narrative and non-narrative parts of the text.</p>
        <p>In lines 9 through 15 no events are presented. In addition, we are not exclusively confronted with objects from the fabula. Lines 9 through 12 convey the idea that Mr Alexander and Miss Ann love each other. The two actors are described in their relationship to each other, or rather, the collective actor “<span>bridal pair</span>” is described as consisting of two people who “<span>love each other</span>”. But in doing so, we neglect the word “<span>fortunately</span>” in line 12. This word communicates an opinion, relating to the balance (“<span>just as much</span>”) between the two actors. A balance of this kind is evaluated favourably. This adverb cannot be termed descriptive, because it refers to something of a more general, more public and cultural bearing than the fabula. Parts of the text referring to something general are best called argumentative. Argumentative textual passages do not refer to an element (process or object) of the fabula, but to an external topic. From this definition, it appears that the term “<span>argumentative</span>” should be taken in the widest sense. Not only opinions but also declarations on the factual state of the world fall under this definition: for instance, sentences like “<span>water always boils at 100 degrees</span>”, or “<span>Poland lies behind the Iron Curtain</span>”. Also, sentences of this type communicate no more than a vision of reality. High in the mountains, or using another method of scaling the thermometer, water boils at a different temperature (i.e., a different representation of temperature).</p>
        <p>That the second example denotes not a fact but an opinion is evident when we change the sentence to “<span>Poland lies in Eastern Europe</span>”, or “<span>Bonn lies behind the Iron Curtain</span>”. Whereas the sentence could still appear factual when I first wrote this book, it has now become a “<span>dated</span>” sentence that is no longer true even if one still holds on to the opinion it expresses. Because the division between opinions and facts is difficult to draw, it makes sense to consider “<span>argumentative</span>” statements that refer to something of general knowledge outside the fabula.</p>
        <p>The word “<span>fortunately</span>” formed part of a sentence that is, for the rest, descriptive. Analysing the story line by line, lines 9 to 12 describe elements of the fabula. Lines 13 to 15, however, do not contain any reference to elements of the fabula that could be described. Here we only see the representation of opinions about behaviour: people who love each other marry; this is what is usually done, and (therefore) is as it should be. This opinion is represented in a certain form. This form, the game of question and answer in a mock dialogue, had already started in line 2. The form conceivably has a convincing effect: the opinion is not presented as a personal one, but as something self-evident. This catechism is extended to convince the reader that she has known the truth all along. The numerous exclamation marks and additions like “<span>of course</span>” pursue the same goal. This kind of ideological drill may not be so common any longer in contemporary children’s fiction, but in subtler forms it is not absent at all.</p>
        <p>In the next line, the actors are linked to the public opinion through mention of their conformism. They are merely described in that sentence. Only in the last sentence is a presentation of an event narrated. A new actor appears, the mayor. He is confronted with another actor, the bridal pair. This confrontation has a temporal aspect that will be explained in the next chapter. Though the act of the mayor is durative, not circumscribed in time, it appears from the lines following those of our passage that waiting must, nevertheless, be seen as an event. The mayor gets irritated because he has to wait, and takes action. It would be naive to suppose that only argumentative parts of the text communicate ideology. This happens equally in descriptive and narrative parts of the text; but the manner in which it happens is different. In addition, the example shows that the discursive form – here, the catechistic style – itself has ideological implications. What matters most is not the ideology of marriage as the universal form of “<span>acting</span>” upon love, but its presentation in a form of “<span>teaching</span>” of a particular kind: the drill.</p>
        <p>The argumentative parts of the text often give explicit information about the ideology of a text. It is, however, quite possible that such explicit statements are treated ironically in other parts of the text, or are contradicted by descriptive or narrative parts of the text to such an extent that the reader must distance herself from them. If we want to evaluate the ideological tenor of a text, an analysis of the relationship between these three textual forms within the totality of the entire text is a crucial element. Non-narrative comments occur everywhere within narratives. The reverse is also true: non-narrative texts, including scientific ones, are also replete with narrative.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">4: Description</h3>
        <p>Description is a privileged site of focalization, and as such it has great impact on the ideological and aesthetic effect of the text. But it is also a particular textual form, indispensable, indeed, omnipresent in narrative. In this section description will be analysed as a textual form; in chapter 2 the concept of focalization will be added.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Delimitation</em></strong></p>
        <p>Although descriptive passages would appear to be of marginal importance in narrative texts, they are, in fact, both practically and logically necessary. Practically, they help the imagined world of the fabula become visible and concrete. They make it possible to participate in the imagination of someone else. Logically, fabula elements need to be described so that their functions make sense. Narratology, therefore, must take these segments of the text into account.</p>
        <blockquote>a Bob Assingham was distinguished altogether by a leanness of person, a leanness quite distinct from physical laxity, which might have been determined, on the part of superior powers, by views of transport and accommodation, and which in fact verged on the abnormal. Henry James, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Golden Bowl</em></blockquote>
        <p>This excerpt is clearly a description. Mostly, things are less straightforward. Just try to define what a description is, and then consider: Is the following fragment, which not only describes objects and people but also accounts for the passage of a certain stretch of time, descriptive?</p>
        <blockquote>b Presently he told her the motion of the boat upon the stream was lulling him to rest. How green the banks were now, how bright the flowers growing on them, and how tall the rushes! Now the boat was out at sea, but gliding smoothly on. And now there was a shore before him. Charles Dickens, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dombey and Son</em></blockquote>
        <p>This passage is a description, for it ascribes features to objects: the banks are green, the flowers are bright, the bushes tall. I will, therefore, define a description as a textual fragment in which features are attributed to objects. This aspect of attribution is the <em>descriptive function</em>. We consider a fragment descriptive when this function is dominant. Thus, example a is predominantly descriptive, while b is a mixture of description and narration.</p>
        <p>Within the realistic tradition, description has always been considered problematic. In the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Republic</em>, Plato tried to rewrite fragments of Homer so that they would be “<span>truly</span>” narrative. The first elements to be discarded were the descriptions. Even Homer himself attempted to avoid, or at least to disguise, descriptions by framing them as narrative. Achilles’s shield is described as it is in the process of being made, Agamemnon’s armour as he puts it on. In the nineteenth-century realistic novel, descriptions were at least narratively motivated if they were not made narrative. And despite its efforts to avoid representation, the <em>nouveau roman</em> has continued to follow this tradition.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Motivation</em></strong></p>
        <p>Working intuitively from the premise that descriptions interrupt the line of the fabula – a premise that, as we have just seen, is somewhat problematic – the ways in which descriptions are inserted characterize the rhetorical strategy of the narrator. In realistic narrative, insertion necessitates motivation. If, as Zola argued, the novel should be objective, this notion of objectivity necessitates naturalization – that is, making those interruptions known as descriptions seem self-evident or necessary, so that the inflections of the presentation, the attribution of qualities, and the ideological machinations remain invisible. This so-called objectivity is, in fact, a form of subjectivity in disguise. This is most conspicuous when the meaning of the narrative resides in the reader’s identification with the psychology of a character. This happens when characters are given the function of authenticating the narrative contents. If truth, or even probability, is no longer a sufficient criterion to make narrative meaningful, only motivation can suggest probability, thus making the contents believable, plausible. That is why motivation is an aspect of realist narrative rhetoric.</p>
        <p>On the basis of the theory of narrative presented in this book, we can distinguish three types of motivation. Speaking, looking, or acting – the three forms of narrative agency – bring about motivation. The most effective, the most frequent, and the least noticeable form is motivation through looking. Motivation is, then, a function of focalization. The description is the reproduction of what the character sees. Looking at something requires time, and, in this fashion, the description is incorporated into the time lapse caused by the interruption. But an act of looking must also have its exterior motivation. There must be enough light that the character is able to observe the object. Hence, there is a window, an open door, and an angle of vision that also have to be described and therefore motivated. Furthermore, the character must have both the time to look and a reason to look at an object. Hence the curious characters, the men of leisure, the unemployed, and the Sunday strollers.</p>
        <p>Given the fundamental arbitrariness of the elements of the fictional world, there is, equally fundamentally, no end to the need for motivation. Later writers such as Nathalie Sarraute and Alain Robbe-Grillet in the French <em>nouveau roman</em> have mocked this predicament of realistic fiction. In the following fragment, for example, the motivation is easily integrated into the description itself (emphasis added):</p>
        <blockquote>When they had washed they lay and <em>waited</em> again. There were fifteen beds in the tall, narrow room. The walls were painted grey. The windows were long but high up, <em>so that you could see</em> only the topmost branches of the trees in the grounds outside. <em>Through the glass</em>the sky had no colour.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Jean Rhys, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Outside the Machine</span>”, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tigers Are Better-Looking</em></blockquote>
        <p>The sentence immediately preceding the description (“<span>they lay and waited again</span>”) gives sufficient motivation for the act of looking. Hospital patients, particularly after their morning wash, have an ocean of time ahead of them. This is a subjective motivation. Not only is the act of looking itself motivated, but so also are the contents of what the women see. And this is indicated by “<span>so that you could see</span>”, by the boundaries of the area that is visible. This exterior motivation is doubled up. The window motivates the fact that the women are able to see anything at all of what is happening outside the hospital. But also, the restricted quality of the field of vision is emphasized: “<span>Through the glass the sky had no colour</span>”. This lack of colour has its own thematic meaning, so that even in this respect the description is fully integrated into the text.</p>
        <p>When a character not only looks but also describes what it sees, a certain shift in motivation occurs, although in principle all of the motivational demands mentioned remain valid. The act of speaking necessitates a listener – the “<span>you</span>” to whom the “<span>I</span>” speaks. The character-bound speaker must possess knowledge that the character-bound listener does not have but would like to have. The listener can, for example, be blind, or young, or amateurish; curious, in need of information, or threatened. There is yet a third form of motivation, one that resembles Homeric description. On the level of the fabula, the actor carries out an action with an object. The description is then made fully narrative. An example of this is the scene in Zola’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La bête humaine</em> in which a compulsive killer, Jacques, polishes (strokes) every individual component of his beloved locomotive.</p>
        <p>Motivation occurs at the level of text when the character itself describes an object, as a character-bound narrator; at the level of story when the vision of the character supplies the motivation; and at the level of fabula when the actor carries out an action with an object. One clear illustration of the latter form, and one that also demonstrates that a distinction between descriptive and narrative is no longer possible within this form, is the following “<span>description</span>” of a dead man:</p>
        <blockquote>Then they went into Jose Arcadio Buendia’s room, shook him with all their might, screamed in his ear, and held a little mirror in front of his nose, but they weren’t able to wake him.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Gabriel Garcia Marquez, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">One Hundred Years of Solitude</em></blockquote>
        <p>Motivation is a way of making the relationship between elements explicit. Precisely because these relationships are not self-evident in fictional texts, they can never be motivated enough. And, for this reason, motivation is, in the final analysis, arbitrary.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Rhetoric of Description</em></strong></p>
        <p>To enable the arbitrary to pass for inevitable or even “<span>natural</span>”, writers appeal to rhetoric. This is particularly the case for descriptions because their arbitrary motivation is in need of masking. Descriptions consist of a theme (e.g., “<span>house</span>”), which is the object described, and a series of sub-themes (e.g., “<span>door</span>”, “<span>roof</span>”; “<span>room</span>”), which are the components of the object. Taken together, the sub-themes constitute the nomenclature. They may or may not be accompanied by predicates (e.g., “<span>pretty</span>”, “<span>green</span>”, “<span>large</span>”). These predicates are qualifying when they indicate a characteristic of the object (“<span>pretty</span>”); they are functional when they indicate a function, action, or possible use (“<span>inhabitable for six people</span>”). Metaphors and comparisons can occur on any level. A metaphor can replace the theme or accompany it. The same holds for the sub-themes. The inclusive relation between theme and sub-theme is synecdochic (a part stands for the whole); the relation between the sub-themes is contiguous (one thing follows, or is adjacent to, another). Both relations can be termed metonymical. Between the theme or sub-theme compared and the predicates that replace them in metaphor, or specify them in comparison, the relation is termed metaphorical. On the basis of these two possible rhetorical relations, we can roughly differentiate six types of description.</p>
        <p>1: The Referential, Encyclopaedic Description</p>
        <p>In principle, there are no figures of speech in this type of description. The selection of components is based upon the contiguity of the elements of the contents. This means that the presence of some elements implies the absence of others. The reader can fill in the missing detail. General characteristics imply specific characteristics, unless the latter represent the former. The objective is to convey knowledge. The encyclopaedia is a model of this type of description.</p>
        <p>2: The Referential-Rhetorical Description</p>
        <p>The tourist guidebook rather than the encyclopaedia is the model for this second type of description. The units are now combined on the basis of both the contiguity of the components and their thematic function. The latter is evaluative. The objective is both to convey knowledge and to persuade. Persuasion occurs via the wording (a pleasing rhythm, a style that reflects the value of the object to be described, for example an “<span>expensive</span>” style to describe the ChampsElysees), and via the contents; persuasion also occurs via the choice of traditionally valued sub-themes, and by the addition of evaluative predicates. Even when a number of metaphors are included in such a description, the construction of the text continues to follow the principle of contiguity.</p>
        <p>3: Metaphoric Metonymy</p>
        <p>Here again, contiguity is the dominating principle of construction. But in this case, metaphors are made of each individual component. Various compared elements may, in fact, be omitted altogether. Only the comparing elements are found in the text, which, as a result, is of a very metaphoric nature. However, there is no relation of contiguity among the components of the comparison. Such a relation exists only among the implicit components of the compared elements. Superficially, this type of description would make an incoherent impression upon the reader. That such is not the case indicates that the reader is engaged in a filling-in activity.</p>
        <p>4: The Systematized Metaphor</p>
        <p>This description is one large metaphor. The elements of the comparison and those of the compared objects are systematically related to each other. Each series is built upon the principle of contiguity. The series balance each other. The question as to which of the two series dominates the meaning cannot be answered without taking the context into consideration. Also included in this category are descriptions in which elements of the two series imply each other.</p>
        <p>5: The Metonymic Metaphor</p>
        <p>The description is one large metaphor. The elements are contiguously related to one another. They form a coherent description that, taken as a whole, is the comparison of an object that is compared to it. This relationship can remain implicit, in which case this type of description, when taken out of its context, cannot be distinguished from one of the other types. An explicit comparing element results in a Homeric comparison.</p>
        <p>6: The Series of Metaphors</p>
        <p>This description consists of a metaphor that is expanded without continually referring to the compared element. The metaphor is repeatedly “<span>adjusted</span>”, creating the impression that the compared element is elusive and indescribable. This rhetorical categorization of description on the basis of its tropes has been used to characterize narrative in different historical periods or styles.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Descriptology</span>” in Practice</em></strong></p>
        <p>Delimitation, motivation, and the rhetorical features of description all appear in this fragment from Djuna Barnes’s modernist novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightwood</em>(1937).</p>
        <blockquote>On the second landing of the hotel […] a door was standing open, exposing a red carpeted floor, and at the further end two narrow windows overlooked the square.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>On a bed, surrounded by a confusion of potted plants, exotic palms and cut flowers, faintly oversung by the notes of unseen birds, which seemed to have been forgotten – left without the usual silencing cover, which, like cloaks on funeral urns, are cast over their cages at night by good housewives – half flung off the support of the cushions from which, in a moment of threatened consciousness she had turned her head, lay the young woman, heavy and dishevelled. Her legs, in white flannel trousers, were spread as in a dance, the thick lacquered pumps looking too lively for the arrested step. Her hands, long and beautiful, lay on either side of her face.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>The perfume that her body exhaled was of the quality of that earthflesh, fungi, which smells of captured dampness and yet is so dry, overcast with the odor of oil and amber, which is an inner malady of the sea, making her seem as if she had invaded a sleep incautious and entire. Her flesh was the texture of plant life, and beneath it one sensed a frame, broad, porous and sleepworn, as if sleep were a decay fishing her beneath the visible surface. About her head there was an effulgence as of phosphorus glowing about the circumference of a body of water – as if her life lay through her in ungainly luminous deteriorations – the troubling structure of the born somnambule, who lives in two worlds – meet of child and desperado.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Like a painting by the <em>douanier</em> Rousseau, she seemed to lie in a jungle trapped in a drawing room (in the apprehension of which the walls have made their escape), thrown in among the carnivorous flowers as their ration; the set, the property of an unseen <em>dompteur</em>, half lord, half promoter, over which one expects to hear the strains of an orchestra of wood-wind render a serenade which will popularize the wilderness. (Barnes 56)</blockquote>
        <p>The narrator is describing a visual event: Felix Volkbein sees Robin Vote. An aristocrat in search of a wife meets the most fugitive human being, and the story of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightwood</em> can begin. In terms of form, this piece presents itself as a classical novelistic description. It comprises an introductory frame, a clear subject–object split, and a detailing of both the perception of the object and the elements constituting it. An external narrator utters the words. But the passage also turns away from description, through its deployment of metaphor, its decentring evocation of endless other things – sea, forest, mushrooms, painting, circus (“<span>unseen <em>dompteur</em></span>”, a key ambiance for the man Felix, framer of this description by his act of perception), music – and its narrativity. The reader is warned: “<span>the thick lacquered pumps looking too lively for the arrested step</span>” counter rational knowledge. At the same time, “<span>arrested</span>” foregrounds the descriptive nature of the passage; the way it stops narrative in its tracks.</p>
        <p>This passage also ruptures linearity through its anticipatory foresight, turning from the metaphor-announcing “<span>as if</span>” to the referent, which escapes the focalizer and will continue to escape him forever: “<span>the born somnambule</span>”, who cannot be a wife to him, nor a lover to anyone, “<span>meet of child and desperado</span>”. Through a rhetoric ranging from expansion to the description of a non-existent painting (called <em>ekphrasis</em>), from disorder to distraction, and from deceleration to intensification of the moment, this description contains, in a nutshell, the history, the theory, and the criticism of description in narrative.</p>
        <p>“<span>On the second landing</span>”, “<span>On the bed</span>”: these phrases literalize the realistic framing so characteristic of the modernist novel’s predecessors. The former narrativizes the focalizer, Felix, whose vision of Robin is the narrative referent of the description – what I term “<span>motivation</span>”, the subtle integration of the description into the narrative. He goes up, then looks down. The focalization establishes the link of perception between subject and object. Ascending in body, the focalizer descends in vision. Presenting the future object of obsessive pursuit – and the subject of obsessive withdrawal – as lying on a bed, the passage presents itself not only as a view from above, but also as a traditional painting. The frame comprises the paraphernalia of the late nineteenth-century artist’s studio – “<span>potted plants, exotic palms and cut flowers</span>” – and the subliminal Orientalism inherent in it. The fake fairy atmosphere of that site of representation is further expanded by “<span>faintly oversung by the notes of unseen birds</span>”, a clause that thickens the subjectivism with senses other than vision, with sound, for example (soon, smell will be added), while enhancing the limited view.</p>
        <p>The intensification of the focalizer’s perception, together with the narrative expansion of the moment, prepares the reader for a heightened sense of suspense, giving anticipatory importance to what will come. And here she is, the image of an odalisque in a Matisse painting: “<span>half flung off the support of the cushions from which, in a moment of threatened consciousness she had turned her head, <em>lay the young woman</em>, heavy and disheveled</span>”. Half flung: as a spectacle of arrested intimate movement, unsuitable for the public gaze, so that the man looking down on her is caught up in the inevitably voyeuristic position. Passive, with the door open, the young woman “<span>asks for it</span>”. And, although the two people involved in this description are soon to marry and procreate, it seems predictable that in terms of <em>relationship</em>, their case is hopeless.</p>
        <p>This description of Robin Vote, the central character of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightwood</em>, foregrounds what it is that has made description such a bone of contention, so subject to paradox, such an object of contempt. It also demonstrates that subjectivity and chance are the two critical responses to realist fiction, whose traps these two states of mind constitute. Moreover, it recalls the dual status of the non-narrative description of an imaginary visual image called <em>ekphrasis</em> as interruptive yet constitutive of narrativity. This convoluted and self-undermining love story begins when one of Robin’s prospective lovers, Felix, chances upon her in a hotel room, where he goes because someone told him to. This description, therefore, is a beginning. It is also a prediction of an end. Thus it comprises the time of the novel, including the body of its fabula, which is none other than the repetition of the failure to relate that is staged here. Description, thus, is both narrative’s “<span>other</span>” and an integral part of it.</p>
        <p>Is the comparison “<span>like a painting by the <em>douanier</em> Rousseau</span>” a decorative, expansive, or specifying metaphor that clarifies the vision so that it can become visible for the reading viewers? Earlier, the woman was already described as “<span>earth-flesh, fungi, which smells of captured dampness</span>”, so that the painted jungles follow, logically and aesthetically, rather than flesh out what is there on stage. Does the <em>ekphrasis</em> produce the woman, or the woman the <em>ekphrasis</em>? While the reader caught by focalization goes along with Felix, adopting his perceptual apparatus, including sight, sound, and smell, our narrative goodwill is put to the test when the focalizer loses his power in favour of the awakening text, which departs from the Sleeping Beauty to turn him into a generalized “<span>one</span>”. This is the narrator’s word, its direction for reading. The description neither presents nor explains the character for the narrative. Instead it produces the former <em>as the latter</em>, seducing the realistic reader into getting lost in the modernist jungle. This is why modernist novels appear difficult.</p>
        <p>Much easier is the well-known strategy used, for example, by Thomas Hardy in his 1891 novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tess of the d’Urbervilles</em>. There the heroine’s moods and states correspond, almost point-by-point, with the brightness or darkness of the environment in which the character evolves. Colours appear to stand for – be a sign of – states of mind, which easily translate into metaphorical colours and shades. Almost inevitably, the convergence of the visible features of the character and her environment produces a prose in which description mingles with the narration of events. Hardy’s novel seems to get away with a kind of descriptive exuberance that rhetoricians and, later, theorists would somehow find problematic. I think it is because of the habit of scholars to reiterate the same examples from a limited corpus that the gap between critical writings on the novel and narrative theory is wider than necessary.</p>
        <p>To the contemporary literary sensibility, the gap between a criticism that applauds description and a narrative theory that marginalizes it appears to come from the experience of reading versus the logic of structure. Structuralism is useful only when kept in its modest place: as a trigger and tool for discussion, a measure for comparison, and not as a truth that makes its overflow invisible. Like Cervantes’s, these novels both deploy and denaturalize description. Whereas Cervantes’s antihero is declared mad for seeing what is not there – for seeing an army in a cloud of dust produced by a herd of sheep – and Zola and Co boasted the referential existence of their described objects, modernism, with its dual philosophy of subjectivity and chance, is well placed to demonstrate an altogether different status for description.</p>
        <p>The cited passage from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightwood</em> makes the complexity abundantly clear. The introductory frame represents the difficulty of keeping that frame within its own bounds. In this way framing is put on the table. The passage positions itself as ostentatiously far from naturalizing description through character-bound focalization. This agent binds each element – a painter’s studio, a painting, and an object that refuses to stay still – to a larger whole, which is not a woman but a domain of sense-perception. As a result, this passage’s descriptive discourse comments on the coherence within narrative as an altogether different kind of order from the real social one.</p>
        <p>This is quite unsettling for those who are used to realist narrative. In the case of a person, for example, the description would move from head to foot and from the eyes to the rest of the face. This is the order from top to bottom combined with the move from centre to periphery. For landscapes, the order might be from foreground to background, vague to clear, left to right. Alternately, the description could run through the different senses involved in the perception of the object. The famous opening of Balzac’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le père Goriot</em> (1835) follows the long shot zooming into a close-up, a move that, as it turns out, follows the steps of the character. And as this fellow, Eugene, enters the rooming house, the sense of sight is complemented with the sense of smell. This ordered and neatly hierarchized expansion is parodied in Barnes’s novel, where smell intervenes too early and practically takes over. This strategy results in a motivation that absorbs descriptions within the narrative.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">5: Levels of Narration</h3>
        <p>In the fragments d to g of our discussion of Couperus’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em>, there was one phrase that remained unchanged throughout: “<span>Oh, that voice of Steyn’s!</span>” This phrase shows several characteristics of emotive language use – that is, the use of language that aims at self-expression of the speaker with regard to that about which it speaks. The element of this phrase that most strikingly indicates an emotive function is the word “<span>Oh</span>”. The exclamation mark is a graphic representation of an emotionally laden intonation. Moreover, the grammatical peculiarity that this sentence lacks a verb, reinforces its emotional effect.</p>
        <p>Who is expressing this emotion? In other words, who says: “<span>mama Ottilie hissed</span>”? The verb “<span>hiss</span>” is in this sense a declarative verb, comparable to “<span>say</span>” but colouring that verb. Declarative verbs indicating that someone is about to speak are, in a narrative text, signs of a change in level in the narrative text. Another speaker enters the scene. In d the external narrator temporarily yields the floor to Ottilie. The character Ottilie thus becomes a speaker at the second level, which I indicate as second-level character-bound narrator (if you like, CN2.) Note, however, that the use of that characterization is not entirely convincing. Though Ottilie, at least temporarily, speaks, she does not narrate: what she says is not a story. Nevertheless, I will use this indication because it makes clear that the character is a speaker, just like the narrator. What that narrator says is another matter, to which I will return in the subsection “<span>Relations between Primary and Embedded Texts</span>”. The concept “<span>second-level character-bound narrator</span>”, then, refers to a character that is quoted by the narrator of the first level, whether that speaker is an external or a character-bound narrator. A second-level character-bound narrator is a speaker on the second level.</p>
        <p>But what about that phrase in the fragments e, f, and g? It is on purpose that I have broken off the quotation in such a way that we cannot see who speaks. The declarative verb is missing. In e there are two possibilities:</p>
        <p>e.i Oh, that voice of Steyn’s, I hissed between my teeth.</p>
        <p>e.ii Oh, that voice of Steyn’s! I could not bear it any longer.</p>
        <p>In e.i there is a declarative verb to indicate that what precedes is direct discourse, an embedded sentence. The speaker of the first level yields to the speaker of the second level. A character-bound narrator (“<span>I</span>”) quotes a second-level character-bound narrator (“<span>I</span>”). Just as in d, the emotive sentence is an embedded sentence, a sentence within a sentence, which can be represented by the use of brackets: a character-bound first-level narrator quotes a second-level character-bound narrator, or CN1[CN2]. The character in both cases is called Ottilie. But narratologically speaking, it is not the same Ottilie. The character-bound first-level narrator only relates after the fact, in the narrative “<span>now</span>”, albeit in the past tense, what the second-level character-bound narrator said earlier, “<span>then</span>”, the past of the narrative “<span>now</span>”. As a linguistic act, the emotive phrase forms part of the text. In another version of the same story, for instance, it might be represented thus: “<span>Ottilie expressed her irritation at the voice of Steyn</span>”. Direct discourse or direct speech, an embedded sentence, is the object of a language act. Thus it is, in principle, an event like so many other events.</p>
        <p>In e.ii the emotive sentence belongs to the text of first-level characterbound narrator. Though the emotion communicated does form part of the text, the expression of it does not. In a summary of the fabula we would read: “<span>Ottilie was irritated by Steyn’s voice</span>”. Not the act of verbal expression of the irritation but the irritation itself is, in principle, an event. Fragment f contains the same possibilities:</p>
        <p>f.i. Oh, that voice of Steyn’s! Ottilie hissed between her teeth.</p>
        <p>f.ii. Oh, that voice of Steyn’s! I understood how Ottilie could not bear it any longer.</p>
        <p>In f.i the first-level external narrator yields the word to the second-level character-bound narrator (Ottilie). Thus we have an ordinary embedded sentence, as we might find in any narrative text. The sequel given to the emotive phrase in f.ii is of a piece with the interpretation of f given above, where I assumed that the perceptible external narrator, who is also the external focalizer, was on Ottilie’s side. The words of the emotive phrase are thus ascribed to the perceptible external narrator, and the first level is maintained.</p>
        <p>Still, something has changed in this fragment. Through the addition into the narrative text of so clearly an emotive sentence of the first level, the external narrator’s voice becomes much more perceptible than it already was. It suggests, in this emotive expression, that the external narrator has heard Steyn’s voice and that “<span>it</span>” has been irritated by it too. If this agent has heard the voice, he or she was, implicitly, present as an actor at the scene. That is why f and the variant f.ii have the same structure as g. The narrative “<span>I</span>” has become, by implication, a testifying actor. The reader will not be surprised therefore when a narrative situation with a character-bound narrator-witness presents itself in the text. This is one of the cases in which a superficial, general characterization of the narrative situation is unsatisfactory. The first-level external narrator may any minute start speaking on the second level as perceptible narrator, or do something else that turns it into an actor.</p>
        <p>There is no reason to dwell on g. The possibilities are identical to those in f. Considering the narrative situation of g, it would seem obvious that either Ottilie speaks the emotive sentence as perceptible second-level character-bound narrator, or the character-bound narrator- witness speaks it as a first-level character-bound narrator. In the analysis of examples e through g, we only took into account the possibility that the character-speaker, the second-level character-bound narrator, utters the words in fact. It does, however, also frequently occur that words, put in direct speech, are merely thought. Thus f might also have the following variant:</p>
        <p>f.iii Oh, that voice of Steyn’s! Ottilie thought.</p>
        <p>What the second-level character-bound narrator has narrated is not perceptible, because other actors who may happen to be present cannot hear the text. When an utterance narrated at the second level is not perceptible, this is also an indication of fictionality. If the narrator’s realistic rhetoric seeks to keep up the pretence that it is relating true facts, it can never represent the thoughts of actors other than itself. This variant, then, only contradicts the pretence “<span>I state autobiographically</span>” or “<span>I testify</span>” when a first-level character-bound narrator (“<span>I</span>”) quotes a second-level character-bound narrator (another actor). The verb is not declarative; rather, it is a synonym for “<span>to think</span>”. This distinction helps us gain insight into the balance of power between the characters. When a character does not hear what another character thinks, and readers do receive information concerning these thoughts, readers may easily come to expect too much of the first character. They may, for instance, expect that the character will take feelings, only formulated in thought, into account, in this case that Steyn will speak less loudly because his voice upsets Ottilie. But Steyn cannot know that it does, in this case, because he is outside the room. Or, perhaps, because the irritation would not be expressed in words.</p>
        <p>In most linguistic narratives, a narrator quotes speeches or thoughts of characters. Within such quotes, other characters can hear the second level narrator or speaker, but not always; nor is it always indicated whether others do hear the quoted words. If one character has thoughts that contain devastating judgments about another but does not express these to that character while the thoughts are narrated so as to appear like quotes, a fundamental inequality results. This inequality has been put to strategic use, for example, in the French novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cat</em> by Colette. There, a young couple’s first months of marriage are presented as an inexorable decline in the relationship. Systematically, the thoughts of the man, who judges his wife mercilessly, are quoted, often without the attributive verb that would make clear that the thoughts are not uttered out loud. The woman, in contrast, is only quoted when speaking, mostly to her husband. As a result, the criticisms the man holds against his wife are told to the reader over her head. She does not have a clue that he is so dissatisfied; nor does she have access to his negative responses to what she says to him.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Analysing Levels of Narration as a Tool for Literary History</em></strong></p>
        <p>Like description, as we have seen in the fragment from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightwood</em>, the structure of levels of narration can be a tool for characterizing narratives historically – to see them in light of literary currents. But in order to avoid facile categorizations, the same structure can inflect, modify, and nuance such characterizations. I will briefly demonstrate this with three opening sentences of novels belonging to three different periods with their own literary movements. Two of the most famous French novels, Flaubert’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em> and Proust’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">À la recherche du temps perdu</em>, begin with an internal narrator. Flaubert: “<span>Nous etions a l’Etude quand le proviseur entra, suivi d’un <em>nouveau</em> habille en bourgeois et d’un garcon de classe qui portait un grand pupitre</span>” (We were in studyhall when the headmaster entered, followed by a new boy not yet in school uniform and by the handyman carrying a large desk). Proust: “<span>Longtemps, je me suis couche de bonne heure</span>” (For a long time I used to go to bed early).</p>
        <p>Technically, in both novels all quoted speeches are, then, second-level narrations. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madame Bovary</em>, though, the first-level, first-person narrator disappears from view rather quickly. He actually never says “<span>I</span>”. The collective first person, repeated only once a few pages later, rather serves the purpose of positing the reality of the subsequent narration – the idea that the narrator was there when it happened, as a narratorwitness. Soon he will be forgotten, and the rest of the long novel seems to be told by an external narrator. But we will see later that his initial implication leads to other ways of implicating him, and “<span>us</span>”.</p>
        <p>After the first few pages, the “<span>nous</span>” (we) returns one more time: “<span>Il serait maintenant impossible a aucun de nous de se rien rappeler de lui</span>” (It would be impossible today for any of us to remember anything about him). It is striking that the adverb <em>maintenant</em> (today, now) pulls the first person from the past into the present. Never mind that the preceding description is so precise, so detailed, and includes quoted speeches, and as such contradicts the double negative.</p>
        <p>Since all evidence points to the presence of the narrator as an internal narrator, the emphatic denial of knowledge must serve some other purpose. The lack of memorability, the total ordinariness of the new classmate must be, then, the point of the use of “<span>nous</span>”. The narrator is a witness, but the character is so ordinary that he could be anyone, easily overlooked. This makes him, and the story that begins with his description, both allegorical – an “<span>Everyman</span>” – and as real as everyone else. The narrator’s status as a witness will enable him to present a devastating critique of his environment – the here-now – as well as shift his position constantly and creatively from identification with the main character Emma to an almost cynical outsider’s position.</p>
        <p>What the narrator as witness is about to recount, then – so the “<span>nous</span>” intimates – is a story taken from real life, life in the countryside, as the subtitle “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Moeurs de Province</span>” suggests; and thanks to the “<span>maintenant</span>” in the second sentence in the first-person plural, we know that story will be contemporary. This discourse of “<span>us</span>” in the here-and-now is Flaubert’s realism. The narrator may be a witness, but the objectivity of realistic fiction is not guaranteed; on the contrary. The judgmental opinions about Emma, the novel’s main character, that one so often encounters indicate that those readers have not read the narrator’s text carefully, and only pay attention to the fabula.</p>
        <p>Proust is a modernist, not a realist. His famous first sentence introduces the long novel that follows in a very different mode. The sentence implies an action – if we can call it that – that is repeated every day, and hence, a state of being, or a mode of living. It is followed by a long reflection on sleep, as a state between conscious and unconscious existence, and thus positions the first-person narrator as deeply subjective. In distinction from Flaubert, Proust develops the subjectivity of his novel in detail and makes it the basis of the narrative. The quoted speeches are all, we presume, “<span>heard</span>”, witnessed, by this narrator and thus embedded in his subjective discourse. Far from the realism attributed to Flaubert, Proust’s novel stands for a modernist poetics because of this emphasis on subjectivity.</p>
        <p>Neither Flaubert nor Proust can be consistently characterized in these historicizing period terms, however. They both give a special twist to what we commonly consider to be typical nineteenth-century realism (Flaubert) and early-twentieth-century modernism (Proust). Both use description and auditory and visual evocations to inflect those categories. We have seen how Flaubert refines the notion of realism as implicating the reader and placing the novel in a strictly contemporary provincial environment. Proust plays with the predicament of subjectivity in the face of speeches and events that the single subject who holds the narrative strings in his hands cannot correctly understand and therefore has difficulty narrating. Both authors use the possibility of quoting embedded speeches – the structure of narrative levels – to explore the limits of their chosen contemporary poetics.</p>
        <p>Postmodern novelists draw on such examples to further complicate the structure of embedding. J.M. Coetzee’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Foe</em> (1986) is a critical reworking of Daniel Defoe’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Robinson Crusoe</em> (1719), the latter a novel whose narrator is also the main character. Defoe’s text reads like a story told in retrospect, at the beginning not quite a diary, but later on more so. Turning the text uttered by an internal narrator upside down, Coetzee makes Cruso (spelled without an e) <em>not</em> the writer of the report and diary; instead he invents a woman. She temporarily joins Cruso on the island where he lives with the mute young black man Friday – a figure whose first appearance, as a footprint in the sand, occurs only in chapter 11 in Defoe’s text, but on the first page of Coetzee’s novel. Thus from the start, the form of narration by an internal narrator is both present and absent. What is lacking, and therefore prevents a full assessment of the novel’s form, is any indication of a second person. To whom is this narration addressed? Neither in Flaubert’s text nor in Proust’s is this an issue. Flaubert’s subject position is safely immersed in the group, and Proust’s “<span>I</span>” going to bed early is rigorously alone. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Foe</em>, by contrast, this question is flaunted as a problem.</p>
        <p>This, then, becomes the structuring question regarding Coetzee’s text. The woman, who turns out to be called Susan Barton, is the narrator as of the first sentence: “<span>At last I could row no further</span>”. The only indication that she may not be the first-level narrator is the presence of quotation marks that open every paragraph up to part III (113). But until the end of part II (111), they never close. Does that mean that twothirds of the text constitute a quotation embedded in a higher-level text of which there is, however, no trace? Yet the “<span>you</span>” occurs as soon as page 9, if only in brackets. There, the narrator says: “<span>… while the stranger (who was of course the Cruso I told you of) gazed at me ..</span>”. Because nothing about Cruso has been mentioned before, we begin to suspect that a structure of <em>in medias res</em> (beginning somewhere in the middle) – a rather normal narrative device when it concerns the fabula – is here deployed on the level of text.</p>
        <p>The identity of this addressee remains unclear for a long time, however, whereas the “<span>you</span>” is emphatically present. Only later do we realize that she is addressing her words to Foe, who appears to be in charge of writing her story. This makes sense of the quote marks that open each paragraph: Susan is not the narrator on the first level, but is being quoted by the genuine storyteller Foe. She is an embedded characternarrator parading as a first-level narrator. But up to page 113, this Foe is absent from the narrative, except as an anonymous “<span>you</span>”. There is another indication of the first-level narrator in his absence. In the first paragraph, Susan gives a description of herself that is impossible for an internal narrator when she says:</p>
        <blockquote>With slow strokes, my long hair floating about me, like a flower of the sea, like an anemone, like a jellyfish of the kind you see in the waters of Brazil, I swam towards the strange island … (5)</blockquote>
        <p>This elaborate description of the way her hair floats, something she cannot see while being the one who is swimming, reads like an attempt to see herself from a distance, from above, so as to give the story more narrative clout. Her sense that she is unable to tell the story she lived – that narrative is radically divorced from experience – is the reason she commissions Foe to write it for her.</p>
        <p>But while she is still the only narrator whose utterances we read, she presents herself as a narrator-witness:</p>
        <blockquote>When I reflect on my story I seem to exist only as the one who came, the one who witnessed, the one who longed to be gone: a being without substance, a ghost beside the true body of Cruso. Is that the fate of all story-tellers? … Return to me the substance I have lost, Mr Foe: that is my entreaty. For though my story gives the truth, it does not give the substance of the truth. (51)</blockquote>
        <p>What she lacks is substance, and that lack turns her into a witness. The floating hair predicts the loss of substance she deplores here. Hence, her ability to write the impossible description, one in which narrative wins over experience. Later (133) she says it in a simpler way, much more plausibly but without the poetic metaphors of the first version: “<span>I slipped overboard, I began to swim, my hair floated about me, and so forth…</span>” The “<span>and so forth</span>” suggests that what she is telling has already been told – that it is a cliche we already know, part of the idiom of storytelling. This means the choice is between poetic narration at the cost of experience – what she calls substance or truth – and flat narration that can only draw from the endless well of cliches.</p>
        <p>This late moment in this novel of a mere 157 pages is followed by a passage where she discusses storytelling passionately with Foe, who, in the third and fourth parts, has turned into a character with whom Susan converses. Thus, it is she who talks on a higher level, quoting him. But this doesn’t quite work either, because their discussions are strictly on the same level, hence, all quotations. The page ends with this decisive passage:</p>
        <blockquote>In the beginning I thought I would tell you the story of the island and, being done with that, return to my former life. But now all my life grows to be story and there is nothing of my own left to me. I thought I was myself and this girl a creature from another order speaking words you made up for her. But now I am full of doubt. Nothing is left to me but doubt. I am doubt myself. <em>Who is speaking me</em>? Am I a phantom too? To what order do I belong? And you: who are you? (133; emphasis added)</blockquote>
        <p>What Coetzee is staging, it seems, as an answer to both realism and modernism, is the impossibility of determining levels of narration. The question “<span>Who is speaking me?</span>” sums up the predicament of the narrator, who, while being the only (speaking) survivor of the adventure, must yield the telling of it to a first-level narrator, so that she is free to be a character, having the experience (“<span>substance</span>”) albeit <em>therefore</em> unable to tell about it in a way that others can enjoy. Between Foe and Susan – witnessed, in the shadow, by the mute Friday – the position of subject of narration is tossed back and forth, with no decisive outcome. The competition between Susan and Foe about the position of narrator is never resolved. This wavering, the unanswerability of the fundamental question “<span>Who is speaking?</span>” that guides the narratology of the text level, characterizes postmodernist literature. Although it is constantly preoccupied with subjectivity, there is no subjective narrator. And although the truth of the story is endlessly discussed, this novel is not realist.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Intermediate Forms: Indirect Speech and Free Indirect Speech</em></strong></p>
        <p>Back to Steyn’s voice. Why does the way in which example f.ii is phrased entail a change in narrative situation? I have emphasized the signs of emotive function because, with this emotive function, the narrator refers to itself. If in a statement the feelings of the speaker are expressed, the statement is about the speaker. Even if the narrator does not explicitly refer to itself, still, the “<span>I</span>” narrates about itself. This means that an actor with the same identity as the narrator forms part of the fabula. Signs of emotive functioning are, therefore, also signs of selfreference. There are more signs of this kind. I would even speak of two different language situations here: language about the contact between speaker and hearer, and language about others.</p>
        <p>This distinction into two language situations, one personal and the other impersonal, may help us understand this and comparable phenomena. In f.ii we have seen details hinting that the narrator is involved with its object. Its language is personal in that it refers to the position of the narrator itself. In doing so, it places itself on the same level as that about which it is speaking in the same statement. Thus it has made itself into a virtual (possible, still unrealized) actor. We may say that, in this case, narrative levels begin to intertwine or even merge. The impersonal language situation we found in example f.ii is invaded. The personal language situation intrudes, but not, as in f.i, on the second level. When an actor in a story begins to speak, she does so, in principle, in a personal language situation, in contact with another actor. In the basic narrative situation, speech is only possible on one narrative level in the personal language situation. At first sight this happens when the narrator addresses herself explicitly, or implicitly, to the reader; at the second level, when an actor speaks to another actor (this may be the speaking actor himself). In f.ii we find a “<span>mixture</span>” of the two narrative levels, which is called text interference.</p>
        <p>The two narrative situations can be distinguished on the basis of references in the text to personal or impersonal language situations. These references can be taken as signals, as signs indicating that “<span>this is a(n) (im)personal language situation</span>”. These signals are often related to the following forms:</p>
        <p>1 personal pronouns (personal: I/you) (impersonal: he/she)</p>
        <p>2 grammatical person (personal: first and second) (impersonal: third person Person)</p>
        <p>3 tense (personal: not all past tenses) (impersonal: all past tenses are possible)</p>
        <p>4 deixis: indicative pronouns (personal: this, these (impersonal: that/those)</p>
        <p>adverbs of place (personal: here/there) (impersonal: in that place)</p>
        <p>adverbs of time (personal: today, tomorrow) (impersonal: that day, the day after)</p>
        <p>5 emotive words and aspects oh! (absent)</p>
        <p>6 conative words and aspects address, command, question: (personal: please) (impersonal: absent)</p>
        <p>7 modal verbs and adverbs which indicate uncertainty in the speaker (personal: perhaps) (impersonal: absent)</p>
        <p>When the signals of the personal language situation refer to the language situation of the narrator, we are dealing with a perceptible narrator (NI(p)). When the signals refer to the language situation of the actors, and a clear change of level has been indicated by means of a declarative verb, a colon, a dash, or quotation marks, we speak of a personal language situation at the second level (CN2). This situation can be called dramatic: just as on the stage, actors communicate through speech in a personal language situation. When, however, the signals refer to a personal language situation in which the actors participate without previously stepping down from their narrative level, then we have <em>text interference</em>. This was the case in f.ii. The NI(p) stepped across, so to speak, to the second level. But that was just one possibility. The inverse occurs more often. Then the words of the actors are represented at the first level, so that the narrator adopts the actor’s discourse.</p>
        <p>The most common form of this is indirect discourse. Here the narrator represents the words of the actor as it is supposed to have uttered them. Compare the following examples:</p>
        <p>h Elizabeth said: “<span>I think I shall be able to find time to go out with you tomorrow night</span>”.</p>
        <p>i Elizabeth said that she might be able to find time to go out with him tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>j Elizabeth said that she would probably have time to go out with him tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>k Elizabeth said that she would probably have time to go out with him the following night.</p>
        <p>In i, j, and k the contents of Elizabeth’s words are represented in an equally adequate manner. The words themselves are represented with maximum accuracy in i, with less accuracy in j, and still less in k. It is impossible and irrelevant to reconstruct the original direct speech from indirect discourse. Comparing the examples, however, it is as if i represents the allegedly spoken words more accurately than j, and j than k. We do not need h to come to this conclusion. In I, “<span>she might be able to</span>”, the modal indication of uncertainty “<span>might</span>” has been combined with a subject-oriented positive verb, “<span>be able to find</span>”. “<span>Tomorrow</span>” is a deictic adverb of time. In j the modal form is still present, but less strongly, in “<span>would probably</span>”. The adverb is less emphatic about personal uncertainty than the expression “<span>might be able</span>”; in j we also find the deictic adverb “<span>tomorrow night</span>”. In k only the weak modal value of “<span>probably</span>” is a trace of the personal language situation. In i, j, and k, we find, compared to h, a number of signs of the impersonal language situation, because the sentence is in indirect discourse. The personal pronoun “<span>I</span>” has been changed into “<span>she</span>”; the verb is now in the third person, and not in the first; and the present future has been changed into a past future.</p>
        <p>On the basis of this analysis, it makes sense to look out for three characteristics that distinguish these forms:</p>
        <p>1 Indirect discourse is narrated at a higher level than the level at which the words in the fabula are supposed to have been spoken.</p>
        <p>2 The narrator’s text explicitly indicates that the words of an actor are narrated by means of a declarative verb and a conjunction, or a substitute for it.</p>
        <p>3 The words of the actor appear to have been rendered with maximum precision and elaboration.</p>
        <p>The first characteristic distinguishes indirect discourse from direct discourse. The second characteristic distinguishes indirect discourse from a mode of representation that is even more indirect. This is most frequently termed <em>free indirect discourse</em>, but is also called “<span>free indirect style</span>” or “<span>reported discourse</span>”. I call it free indirect discourse (FID). The third characteristic distinguishes (free) indirect discourse from narrator’s text. This last distinction is the one that gives us the most problems in the practice of analysis. That is because the third characteristic is relative.</p>
        <p>When characteristic 2 of indirect discourse is left out, and characteristic 3 is present, the result is free indirect discourse. This is a form of mixture or interference between narrator’s text and actor’s text. Signals of the personal language situation of the actor and of the (im)personal language situation of the narrator cross, without explicit reference to this. Thus we have:</p>
        <p>1 Elizabeth might be able to go out with him tomorrow.</p>
        <p>“<span>Tomorrow</span>” and “<span>might</span>” indicate the personal language situation of the actor Elizabeth, while the other signals suggest the impersonal language situation: third person, past tense.</p>
        <p>Precisely because the second characteristic of indirect discourse is lacking – the explicit sign that there is indirect discourse – it is not always clear whether we are dealing with indirect discourse or ordinary narrator’s text. This is so because the third characteristic is relative. That is why we only distinguish free indirect discourse from the narrator’s text when there are positive indications that there is indeed representation of words of an actor. Such indications are:</p>
        <p>1 The signals of a personal language situation, referring to an actor.</p>
        <p>2 A strikingly personal style, attributable to an actor.</p>
        <p>3 More details about what has been said than is necessary for the course of the fabula.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate this I will represent one event – Elizabeth seeks a confrontation with John – in various forms.</p>
        <p>direct speech:</p>
        <p>m Elizabeth said: “<span>I refuse to go on living like this</span>”.</p>
        <p>indirect speech:</p>
        <p>n.i Elizabeth said that she refused to go on living like that.</p>
        <p>n.ii Elizabeth said that she would not go on living like that.</p>
        <p>free indirect:</p>
        <p>o.i Elizabeth would be damned if she’d go on living discourse like this.</p>
        <p>o.ii Elizabeth would not go on living like this.</p>
        <p>narrator’s text:</p>
        <p>p.i Elizabeth did not want to go on living like this.</p>
        <p>p.ii Elizabeth had had it.</p>
        <p>In the analysis of these sentences I assume that the verb “<span>to refuse</span>” fits the usage of the actor Elizabeth, and not the narrator. Of course, without a context, such an assumption is meaningless.</p>
        <p>The direct discourse in m seems unproblematic. We read the precise text as it was supposedly uttered by the actor, and the indications of the changes in level are explicit. As soon as the actor’s text is given by the narrator in the following sentences, changes occur. In n.i, the actor’s text is represented as precisely as possible. As far as contents are concerned, this is also true for n.ii. But the style that is clearly recognizable as the personal style of the irritated actor refers to a personal language situation of the actor, involved in a quarrel. The difference between n.i and n.ii on the one hand, and o.i and o.ii on the other, lies in the presence or absence of a declarative verb with a conjunction. In o.ii the actor’s text has been represented with less precision than in o.i.</p>
        <p>Of course, in studying narrative texts, we never have such artificial combinations at hand. But even without comparison, we may say that o.i is strongly inflected by the actor’s text, and o.ii by the narrator’s text. Still, I also sense free indirect discourse in o.ii, because the adjunct “<span>like this</span>” signals a personal language situation of the actor. The presence of these words also distinguishes o.ii from p.i. In p.i I have used the heavy-handed expression “<span>in the manner disclosed</span>” in order to avoid a deictic element. But even if I had chosen “<span>in that manner</span>”, “<span>that</span>” would refer to what had been stated earlier, hence to the language situation of the narrator, and not the actor. In p.i and ii we have a narrator’s text. We cannot distinguish any signal of the actor’s personal language situation. We have no reason to take p.i as the representation of certain spoken words. Finally, p.ii is the purest form of the narrator’s text. The content is presented as an act. The words in which the refusal is uttered are not mentioned at all.</p>
        <p>Indirect discourse, free indirect discourse, and the narrator’s text in which language acts are narrated are all forms in which the words of an actor are narrated at first level. The degree to which, in this series, justice is done to the text of the actor decreases; on the other hand, the degree to which the speaking of the actor is seen as an act gradually increases. The interference of narrator’s text and actor’s text may occur in widely varying proportions. At the first level, the actor’s text is given minimal reflection in indirect discourse; sometimes the narrator’s text dominates (o.n), then again the actor’s text (o.i). In the narrator’s text the words of the actor are represented not as text, but as an act. In that case we no longer speak of text interference.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Disentangling Interference</em></strong></p>
        <p>Flaubert is notorious as a master of confusing narrative variations of discourse, making it often impossible to disentangle them and distinguish between direct, indirect, and free indirect discourse. FID also facilitates a multiplication of subjectivities. These features make the novel “<span>immersive</span>”, a term usually reserved for exhibitions, not novels. The immersive quality of Flaubert’s text consists in its tendency to move from narration to FID without warning, transition, or clear indication. This is due to the unique, rigorous <em>contemporaneity</em> that is shaped in citational writing. Flaubert recorded not only views but also fragments of discourse, cliches he called <em>idées reçues</em>, from which to stitch the fabric of his novel.</p>
        <p>One example must suffice. I selected a very ordinary passage that is neither dramatic nor focused on the central character Emma. Here, in chapter 7 of part II, is a conversation between Charles and his mother concerning Emma’s vague and inexplicable malaises. It begins in direct discourse.</p>
        <blockquote>− Sais-tu ce qu’il faudrait a ta femme? reprenait la mere Bovary. Ce seraient des occupations forcees, des ouvrages manuels ! … − Pourtant elle s’occupe, disait Charles.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“<span>Do you know what your wife needs?</span>” said the older Madame Bovary. “<span>She needs to be forced to work – hard, manual work …</span>” “<span>She keeps busy, though</span>”, Charles said.</blockquote>
        <p>This is classical, perfectly clear quotation, including the verb “<span>to say</span>” and quotation marks as well as an indication of the subject who is speaking. Each speaker can be characterized by their discourse: the mother is harsh, and full of contempt for Emma; the use of the qualifier “<span>forcees</span>” with “<span>occupations</span>” qualifies the mother and her discourse clearly. This insight can help us disentangle the indirect and free indirect discourses that follow. Charles weakly defends Emma, which tells us about his difficulty in taking decisions. Soon, the discourse changes. And all clarity vanishes.</p>
        <blockquote>Donc, il fut resolu que l’on empecherait Emma de lire des romans. L’entreprise ne semblait point facile. La bonne dame s’en chargea: elle devait quand elle passerait par Rouen, aller en personne chez le loueur de livres et lui representer qu’Emma cessait ses abonnements. N’auraiton pas le droit d’avertir la police, si le libraire persistait quand meme dans son metier d’empoisonneur ? (153)</blockquote>
        <blockquote>So it was decided to prevent Emma from reading novels. The project presented certain difficulties, but the old lady undertook to carry it out: on her way through Rouen she would personally call on the proprietor of the lending library and tell him that Emma was cancelling her subscription. If he nevertheless persisted in spreading his poison, they would certainly have the right to report him to the police. (148)</blockquote>
        <p>The beginning of the passage seems to be a narrator’s summing up, as a conclusive “<span>so</span>” indicates. The second sentence implies a conversation – let’s say, the hesitant Charles objects that it will be difficult to do, and the resolute mother promises to solve the problem. We can already think of this first part of the sentence as approaching FID, rendering Charles’s timid objection. Then, however, the mother’s active meddling is rendered in narrator’s discourse, as the descriptive “<span>old lady</span>” (“<span>la bonne dame</span>”) indicates. Neither Charles nor the mother herself would qualify her in such terms. And “<span>s’en chargea</span>” (“<span>undertook</span>”) is the narrator’s verb that characterizes her readiness to act, again summing up. Possibly, the verb “<span>carry it out</span>” can be either a narrator’s word choice or her own, as if saying: “<span>don’t worry son, you don’t have to do anything, I’ll carry it out</span>”.</p>
        <p>The second half of the sentence clearly moves towards FID, however. This is not emotive discourse, but projecting a plan. She was leaving soon anyway, and it is as if we hear her say: “<span>On my way through Rouen, I will call on the proprietor of the lending library and tell him that Emma is cancelling her subscription</span>”. The only words that change are the verbs, which are in the present tense in the direct discourse, in the past tense in FID. The final sentence of the fragment is more clearly FID, and we know that so clearly because it is in fact a double FID. It renders a quote within a quote. Imagine what the mother will have said to her son: “<span>I will threaten this man: ‘if you nevertheless persist in spreading your poison, we will surely have the right to report you to the police.’</span>” A narrator could have used the word “<span>threaten</span>” and summed up the rest with something like “<span>with the police</span>”. But both “<span>spreading your poison</span>” and “<span>have the right</span>” smack of the angry, intimidating old woman’s righteousness, as she will threaten the librarian with great passion.</p>
        <p>The entire passage becomes a mixture of narrator’s discourse, characters’ quoted discourses, and FID. Why would a novelist structure this passage so confusingly? The point of this, as I interpret it, is to demonstrate the power of the meddlers, so important in this novel. Like Homais the nasty pharmacist, and the gossiping townsfolk who judge Emma’s behaviour and rejoice in her downfall, Madame Bovary senior is herself a poison of sorts. Her domination over her son makes Charles an unhelpful mate for Emma. Such phrases as “<span>his poison</span>” – meaning novels (the French is even stronger, “<span>son metier d’empoisonneur</span>”, “<span>his profession of poisoner</span>”) – can hardly be attributed to the primary narrator of a carefully crafted and proudly presented novel; and one claiming realism to boot, as it was understood at the time, namely as objectivity. Instead, the narrator here quotes, freely-indirectly, not just the mother but the public opinion of a large segment of the population. Thus, the structure of embedded speech builds up the oppressive environment in which Emma is obliged to live. Realism, here, does not mean objectivity but rather a fiercely ironic rendering of a real social structure of embedding whatever a character says in <em>idées reçues</em>.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Relations between Primary and Embedded Texts</em></strong></p>
        <p>When there is text interference, narrator’s text and actor’s text are so closely related that distinctions between narrative levels can no longer be made. The relationship between the narrative levels has exceeded the boundary of maximum intensity. When the texts do not interfere but are clearly separate, there may still be a difference in the degree to which the embedded actor’s text and the primary narrator’s text are related. A number of relationships between texts are possible. I systematically term the narrator’s text “<span>primary</span>”, of course without implying a value judgment, (temporal) priority, or (qualitative) primacy. This only means that the connection is one of levels in the technical sense. In the end, the narrative text constitutes a whole in which, from the narrator’s text, other texts are embedded. The dependence of the actor’s text with regard to the narrator’s text should be seen as the dependence of a subordinate clause to a main clause. According to this principle, narrator’s text and actor’s text are not of equal status. The formally hierarchical position of the texts is indicated by the fundamental principle of <em>level</em>. The relations between narrator’s text and actor’s text may be different in kind and in intensity. A quantitative aspect is of influence here: the more sentences frame the actor’s text, the stronger is the dependence.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Embedded Narrative Texts</em></strong></p>
        <p>Frame narratives are the clearest examples of the structure of embedding. The primary narrator of Emily Bronte’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wuthering Heights</em> (1847) is an internal one, the snowed-in guest Lockwood. After a strange experience during the night, he asks the servant Nelly Dean about the family, and thus she becomes the narrator, already on a second level. As a servant, she is a typical narrator-witness, and it is as a witness that Lockwood asks her to tell the tale. The mostly invisible servant, in the class hierarchy of the day, sees everything, precisely because no one takes her seriously enough to hide things from her. Her tale is so long and elaborate, and so containing of things she cannot have seen, that we soon forget she is telling the story. Thus, we act as the other members of the household: Nelly is just as invisible to us as she is to the others. This produces a liminal affiliation between the structure of narratorial embedding and the social structure of a class society.</p>
        <p>This structure can also encompass many different narratives – more short stories than novels – embedded in a frame narrator. The classic example is the story cycle <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arabian Nights</em>. Here we find narration at several levels. The primary narrative presents the story of Scheherazade, who is threatened with death by her husband, the king. Only if she succeeds in fascinating him with her stories will she survive the night, night after night. Every night she tells a story, and in that story new stories are embedded, so that we have this construction: Scheherazade tells A that B tells that C tells, and so on, sometimes until the eighth degree. In this case, it is possible to say that the structure of narration echoes the paranoid view of women the king holds. When the story is interrupted, he does not kill his wife because he wants to know how the story ends, as much as whether she will be faithful to him. The paranoia and the suspense are mutual representations of each other.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Relations between Primary Fabula and Embedded Text</em></strong></p>
        <p>When the embedded text presents a complete story with an elaborate fabula, we gradually forget the fabula of the primary narrative. In the case of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arabian Nights</em>, this forgetting is a sign that Scheherazade has accomplished her goal: as long as we forget that her life is at stake, the king will too. Here, the apparently loose relationship between primary and embedded text is relevant to the development of the primary fabula. The narrative act of the actor-narrator Scheherazade that produces the embedded text is an important event – even <em>the</em> event – in the fabula of the primary text. The relationship between the primary text and the narrative subject lies in the relationship between the primary fabula and the embedded narrative act. Summarizing the primary fabula, we might also say: “<span>That night Scheherazade enchanted the king</span>”. From this summary it is immediately clear what the function of the act of narration is. That interpretation is endorsed by the motive for the threat: the infidelity of a previous wife of the king. To the king and to Scheherazade, narrating means life, in two different senses.</p>
        <p>Another possible relationship between the two texts presents itself when the two fabulas are related to each other. This structure has two possible meanings: either the embedded story explains the primary story, or it resembles the primary story. In the first case the relationship is made explicit by the actor narrating the embedded story; in the second the explanation is left to the reader, or merely hinted at, in the fabula.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the embedded fabula explains the primary one. Here, it depends on the relationship between the two which fabula the reader sees as more important. It may well be the embedded one. Often the primary fabula is hardly more than the occasion for a perceptible, character- bound narrator to narrate a story. The primary fabula may, for instance, be presented as a situation in which the necessary change cannot be made, because ... Then the embedded narrative follows. A stereotypical example: a boy asks a girl to marry him. She loves him, and would rise on the social scale by marrying him. Still, she cannot accept him. The reason is [that in the past, she was seduced by a ruthless villain, with the usual consequences. Since that time she has carried the stain of her contact with a perfidious man who took advantage of her innocence …]. The girl retires to a nunnery, and the boy soon forgets her. This structure is, in fact, extremely common.</p>
        <p>The embedded text may take up the larger part of a book, as sometimes happens in cautionary tales of this type. The primary fabula is minimal here, because the number of events is small: proposal – exposition – rejection. In this example, the embedded story merely explains the primary fabula. The situation is unchangeable. The fact that the woman tells her story is of no influence on the outcome of the primary fabula.</p>
        <p>In other cases, however, an explanation of the starting situation may also lead to change. For instance, if the young man had been deeply moved by the sad account of his beloved’s past, and recognized her innocence, he might decide to forget the past and “<span>give her a second chance</span>”. The function of the embedded fabula is then no longer merely explanatory: the exposition influences the primary fabula. Consequently, the structure of narrative levels becomes more than a mere storytelling device: it is part of the narrative’s poetics and needs to be understood for the narrative to be fully appreciated.</p>
        <p>This is particularly important in a novel like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beloved</em>, where the secondary narrators’ joint efforts slowly narrate Beloved into life. As the meta-narrative phrase quoted earlier (“<span>the two did the best they could to create what really happened</span>”, 78) has already suggested, narration is an act of creation. In this sense the narrative aligns the power of narration with the divine creation as recounted in the biblical book of Genesis, which is also primarily a speech act. This attention to the relations between narrative levels in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beloved</em> also solves the dilemma of this novel’s critics: does Beloved, the reborn girl who was murdered as a baby, “<span>really</span>” exist, or is she a supernatural phenomenon? The novel gives “<span>evidence</span>” of both possibilities. If we take the relation between primary and secondary narrator seriously, however – but without <em>a priori</em> deciding that the primary level is more important or more “<span>truthful</span>” than the secondary – the question becomes moot. The point of the narrative is, precisely, the creative power of story-telling itself, as a life-giving act.</p>
        <p>In proportion to the degree of intrinsic interest of the fabula in the primary as well as in the embedded text, the tie between the two texts will be more intense and the explanation more functional. The previous fictional example of a banal love story is extreme in one respect; both <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beloved</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> are extreme in another. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em>, the embedded texts relate bit by bit the story of the events in “<span>the Indies</span>” – events that explain a number of events in the primary fabula. In this case, the relationship between the texts is so intense because the embedded fabula, the <em>thing</em>, the murder in the Indies, is always presented only in part. Moreover, the functioning of the CN2 (Harold) is also curious. Sometimes he narrates the story of CN2 (Harold), the older man who remembers things; and sometimes he tells the story of CN3 (Little Harold), the boy who witnessed without understanding. Views of the past as seen <em>then</em> are presented, intermingled with images of the past interpreted with the insight of <em>the present</em>. Within this subtext, a double, or subtly varying, focalization is narrated. This in turn relates to the events in the primary fabula, the slow, inevitable encroachment of the past upon the present. The influence of the explanatory sub-fabula, in all its doubleness, is of decisive importance.</p>
        <p>But when the embedded text is kept to a minimum, its importance for the primary story diminishes. A sentence like “<span>I shall kill you at dawn to prevent you from deceiving me, because my first wife betrayed me</span>” (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arabian Nights</em>) contains an example of a minimal, declarative, embedded narrative text.</p>
        <p>In other cases, the fabulas resemble each other. If they resembled each other completely, we would have identical texts. Then, the primary text would quote itself. Resemblance, however, can never be identity, even if, as in the example of Borges (see below), the entire thrust of the narrator is to establish such identity. Therefore, we speak of stronger and weaker, not absolute resemblance. Even in passport photographs, taken with the express intention of showing resemblance to the person portrayed, degrees of likeness vary.</p>
        <p>When can we speak of resemblance between two different fabulas? A simple and relative solution is this: we speak of resemblance when two fabulas can be paraphrased in such a way that the summaries have one or more striking elements in common. The degree of resemblance is determined by the number of terms the summaries share. An embedded text that presents a story that, according to this criterion, resembles the primary fabula may be taken as a sign of the primary fabula. This phenomenon is comparable to infinite regress. I use the term “<span>mirrortext</span>” for this.</p>
        <p>The following case offers an idea of one particular, frequently established relation, namely that of resemblance, of which it is an extreme case. Between resemblance and repetition the line is fine and subject to scrutiny. Consider the famous story by Jorge Luis Borges, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote</span>”. The story is a paradigmatic example of postmodern literature that questions the foundations of its own art. We have seen this already in Coetzee’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Foe</em>. Borges’s Pierre Menard is a deceased poet who had verbally transcribed portions of Cervantes’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Don Quixote</em>. The narrator states that, although verbally identical to Cervantes’s text, the transcription by Menard is “<span>almost infinitely richer</span>”. He goes on to demonstrate how that is possible by comparing a halfsentence. I will quote a rather long stretch of Borges’s text:</p>
        <p>[Cervantes] wrote (part one, chapter nine):</p>
        <blockquote>... truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, depository of deeds, witness of the past, exemplar and adviser to the present, and the future’s counsellor.</blockquote>
        <p>Written in the seventeenth century, written by the “<span>lay genius</span>” Cervantes, this enumeration is a mere rhetorical praise of history. Menard, on the other [hand], writes:</p>
        <blockquote>... truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, depository of deeds, witness of the past, exemplar and adviser to the present, and the future’s counsellor.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>History, the <em>mother</em> of truth: the idea is astounding. Menard, a contemporary of William James, does not define history as an inquiry into reality but as its origin. Historical truth, for him, is not what has happened; it is what we judge to have happened. The final phrases – <em>exemplar and adviser to the present, and the future’s counsellor –</em> are brazenly pragmatic.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>The contrast in style is also vivid. The archaic style of Menard – quite foreign, after all – suffers from a certain affectation. Not so that of his forerunner, who handles with ease the current Spanish of his time. (69) Borges’s Menard has, the narrator says towards the end, “<span>enriched, by a new technique, the halting and rudimentary art of reading: this new technique is that of the deliberate anachronism and the erroneous attribution</span>” (71).</blockquote>
        <p>What is the point, for Borges’s primary narrator’s rhetoric, of such copying? The issue is time, and history. What this fictional story proposes is not that we all start to copy historical works in order to update them. But there is an important point to make about the reversal that Borges’s narrator operates, without really saying so, between writing and reading. Writing – and by extension, painting or making a film – is an act of reading, and reading is a manner of rewriting or repainting. And such acts don’t occur in empty time but in a time filled by the present. In the present, social agents – subjects with more or less easy access to the codes that direct the cultural integration of images – confront images and see mirrors held up to them. Showing how to read – that is, how to give meaning to messages one vaguely senses but fails to analyse when only dogmatically restricted methods are consecrated as “<span>historical</span>” or “<span>visual</span>” enough – seems to me a valuable contribution made by narratorial experiment to our understanding of art and literature. That is, art, not as a fixed collection of enshrined objects, but as an ongoing, live process. For some, even life-saving; for others, just enlivening; for us all, part of life.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">An Indication to the Reader</em></strong></p>
        <p>When the primary fabula and the embedded fabula can be paraphrased so that both paraphrases have one or more elements in common, the subtext is a sign of the primary text. The place of the embedded text – the mirror-text – in the primary text determines its function for the reader. When the mirror-text occurs near the beginning, the reader may, on the basis of the mirror-text, predict the end of the primary fabula. In order to maintain suspense, the resemblance is often veiled. The embedded text will be interpreted as mirror-text and “<span>give away</span>” the outcome only when the reader is able to capture the partial resemblance through abstraction. That abstract resemblance, however, is usually only captured after the end, when we know the outcome. Thus, suspense is maintained, but the prefiguring effect of the mirror-text is lost.</p>
        <p>The reverse also occurs: the fabula of the embedded text does not veil its resemblance to the primary fabula. The foreshadowing effect is preserved at the expense of suspense. This does not always imply that suspense is entirely lost. Another kind of suspense may arise. From the kind in which both reader and character are equally in the dark, we have stepped up to a second kind: the reader knows, but the character does not, how the fabula will end. The question the reader raises is not “<span>How does it end?</span>” but “<span>Will the character discover it in time?</span>” We can never be sure of this, because resemblance is never perfect. Until the end, there is always the possibility that the embedded fabula resembles the primary one apart from the ending.</p>
        <p>When a mirror-text has been added more towards the end of the primary text, suspense presents itself less emphatically. The course of the fabula is then largely familiar, and the function of the mirror-text is no longer predictive, but retrospective. A simple repetition of the primary fabula in a mirror-text would not be as interesting. Its function is mostly to enhance or inflect significance. The paraphrase of the primary and of the embedded text that we have made in order to infer resemblance will have a more general meaning. This more general sense – a human being always loses against a bureaucracy, or, even more abstractly, “<span>no one escapes fate</span>” – lifts the whole narration to another level. Kafka’s novels do this. The mirror-text serves as directions for use: the embedded story contains a suggestion of how the text should be read. Even in this case, the embedded text functions as a sign to the reader.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">An Indication to the Actor</em></strong></p>
        <p>Just now I have hinted at the possibility that the actor her- or himself may also interpret the mirror-text as a sign. In this way she may discern the course of the fabula in which she is herself engaged. Thus the actor can influence the outcome. She can take fate into her own hands. This happens, for instance, in Poe’s story “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fall of the House of Usher</span>”. The actor who relates the story in which he himself figures saves his own life by correctly interpreting the signs that are presented to him. In the embedded text, which is read out loud, there is mention of a fall. This word “<span>fall</span>” and the concept “<span>house</span>” have two meanings. <em>Fall</em>refers of course to the reduction of a house to ruins, but also to the end of a family line. The Usher family will fall with the death of its last descendant, and the castle will fall down. This is what the CN (“<span>I</span>”-witness) realizes. Because he has the insight that double meanings should be taken seriously, the actor is able to interpret the embedded fabula as a mirror of what is about to happen. That is why he can save himself. He flees, and behind him he sees the castle crumble. Thus he can be a witness and relate this curious story.</p>
        <p>This mirror-text is interesting for yet other reasons. The actor’s realization that double meanings should be taken seriously is itself a sign. It is a “<span>prescription</span>” for the reading of literature. The embedded text, with its double meaning, consists of a piece of literature. This text, interpreted in the widest sense, suggests: “<span>Literature has (at least) a double meaning, or it is not literature</span>”. Thus this embedded text also implies a poetics, a declaration about the ideas on literature that have been embodied in the events in this text. Just as for the actor-witness the correct interpretation of the doubleness of the meaning of the embedded text was a matter of life and death, so the double interpretation of the relationship between primary and embedded text is a matter of life and death, to be or not to be, for literature. As is so often the case, the title of the text, through its use of puns, has already given an indication of these meanings. But at the same time, this title seems deceptively simple. It needs the whole story to disclose the multiplicity of its meanings. By far the majority of embedded texts are non-narrative. No story is related in them. The content of an embedded text may be anything, from assertions about things in general, to discussions between actors, to descriptions, to confidences, and so on. The predominant form is dialogue. Dialogues between two or more actors may even make up the larger part of the entire text. Dialogue is a form in which the actors themselves, and not the primary narrator, utter language. The sentences spoken by the actors produce meaning together in those parts of the text. Such embedded texts share that characteristic with dramatic texts. In dramatic texts the entire text (except, of course, for the stage directions in the paratext) consists of the utterances of actors, who, in their interaction, produce meaning. The dialogues embedded in a narrative text are dramatic in kind. The more dialogue a narrative text contains, the more dramatic that text is. This is why I insisted on the relative nature of the corpus.</p>
        <p>Of course, the same applies to other modes and genres. In some dramatic texts a narrator appears, albeit as a (meta-narrative) figure with actor status in his own right, as happens often in the plays of Bertolt Brecht. The statement “<span>the more dialogue, the more drama</span>”, however, is an oversimplification, since not only quantity matters here. Also, how the dialogues are presented influences the degree to which a text may be experienced as dramatic. When between each utterance of an actor the primary narrator intervenes with additions like “<span>Elizabeth said</span>”, or even more elaborate commentary, the hierarchical relationship between N1 and N2 remains clearly visible. When the clauses follow each other without intervention by the N1, we are likely to forget that we are dealing with an embedded dialogue.</p>
        <p>When the embedded text is spoken – or thought – by one actor, it is a soliloquy or monologue. The content of a monologue can, again, be practically anything. There is no intrinsic difference between an embedded monologue and other language use. Embedded passages contain confidences, descriptions, reflections, self-reflections. This is the reason I will not discuss the monologue further here.</p>
        <p>I began this chapter with the thesis that all utterances, and hence all narratives, imply a speaker. In the course of the chapter it has also become apparent that all speakers address an interlocutor; that “<span>I</span>” can only be “<span>I</span>” if there is a “<span>you</span>” who allows it. As if to make the case against a purist narratology, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arabian Nights</em>, that canonical instance of narrative, dramatizes this situation in an intensive and complex way. Sheherazade’s interlocutor is primarily the king, who lets her live as long as her stories keep him engaged. But there is a second interlocutor, Sheherazade’s sister Dinarzade, who hides under the royal bed. She is the one who keeps the narrative clock, so to speak; she wakes the couple to request the continuation of the storytelling. Narratively speaking, the two interlocutors exist on the same level. But in this dramatic situation, a single act of storytelling is addressing two very different realms. In one realm, Sheherazade is the speaker, telling stories to the king; in the other, she is the dramatic dialogist, giving her sister encoded instructions.</p>
        <p>When the embedded text itself is not discussed in great detail, little can be said about its relationship to the primary text. In every case, the relationship tends to be determined by two factors. Sometimes, explicit commentary on the embedded text that influences our reading of that text is given by the N1. That commentary may be disguised when the embedded text is only hinted at by implication.</p>
        <p>The contents of the embedded text sometimes link with those of the primary text; sometimes the embedded is even the primary’s natural sequel. At other times the embedded text is completely divorced from the primary text; or has an explanatory function; or is similar to the primary text; or contradicts or contravenes it. In each case, the relationship is different. It is, therefore, impossible to just assume that as a general rule, the assertions of either a narrator or an actor carry the meaning of the whole text. Given the technically hierarchical relation between the two texts, one negative word of the N1 would, in principle, be sufficient to radically change the meaning of the whole. That this cannot possibly be maintained means that such technical structures have limited relevance.</p>
        <h3>Remarks and Sources</h3>
        <p>Regarding the distance between author and narrator on which this book is based I have learned from French philosopher Michel Foucault and literary and cultural critic Roland Barthes. Barthes declared the “<span>death of the author</span>” – a powerful statement that triggered a great deal of discussion and controversy. But it was Foucault who developed the arguments. In his attack on the concept and authority of the author, Foucault banishes four different concepts of authorship (“<span>What is an author?</span>”). He questions the psychological idea of the author; the authorial intention; and the historical author as the origin of the work; he also jettisons the last stronghold of the concept of the author, the author-function as the centring of meaning. He does this by arguing that function to be a projection of a reader who requires semantic centrality in order to deal with the work. Foucault’s alternative is a radical proliferation of meaning, where the author/work becomes a fluctuating function always interacting with other functions in the larger discursive field.</p>
        <p>When I speak of the narrator, I do not mean the “<span>implied author</span>”, either. That term was coined by Wayne C. Booth (1961) as a means for discussing and analysing the ideological and moral stances of a narrative text without having to refer directly to a biographical author. As such it preceded the generalized use of the term “<span>narrator</span>”. There are three problems with the term implied author. First, in Booth’s usage, it denotes the totality of meanings that can be inferred from a text. Thus the implied author is the <em>result</em> of the investigation of the meaning of a text, not the <em>source</em> of that meaning. Only after interpreting the text on the basis of a text description can the implied author be inferred and discussed. But by then the need of or wish for it has probably vanished.</p>
        <p>Second, the term is too easily harnessed to grant one person – for example, a teacher or critic – the authority of knowing “<span>what the author meant to say</span>”; in this way, it consigns other readers to the margins. Third, the notion of an implied author is, in this sense, not limited to narrative texts, but can be applied to any text. This is why the notion is not specific to narratology, which has as its object the narrative aspects of a narrative text.</p>
        <p>A final issue must be kept in mind regarding the author. As has been argued, in what is now generally called neoliberal (late capitalist) culture, the author has become a marketable commodity. This constitutes a trap for readers seeking to translate their intimate experience of narratives into a discussable, intersubjective proposal. The commodified author is as fictitious as any character in a narrative and must be subjected to analytical criticism, lest the interpreter be locked from the start into a specific partiality. The result of such a position is disempowerment, a political position that places a strain on interpretive creativity and that generates blindness to alternative possibilities.</p>
        <p>The notion of the narrator needs further positioning, however. I do not mean a storyteller, a visible, fictive “<span>I</span>” who interferes in his/her account as much as s/he likes, or who even participates as a character in the action. This sort of explicit narrator is a specific version of the narrator, one of several possible manifestations. The idea that a narrative text is “<span>uttered</span>” by a narrator is inferred from the communicative nature of the text: if a text can be conveyed, some agent must be doing the conveying. In this discussion, I will rigorously stick to the definition of narrator as “<span>that agent which utters the (linguistic or other) signs that constitute the text</span>”. Only when we confine ourselves to that definition can we avoid confusions that ultimately lead to an appropriation of authority, a blurring of textual nuances, and the erasure of the power inequalities involved.</p>
        <p>In this chapter I have discussed only the status of the narrative agent and its relationship to what is narrated. Linguistically oriented disciplines such as stylistics, but also grammar, syntax, and semantics, are important for different kinds of investigations of the text. Nevertheless, the connections with related disciplines have made themselves felt at several points. The differences between direct, indirect, and free indirect discourse, discussed here because they concern the status of the narrative agent with regard to the object of narration, are a classic topic of linguistics.</p>
        <p>The confusion between pragmatics and semantics that has arisen around Booth’s concept of the implied author is especially noticeable in the work of Booth’s followers, who are numerous. A clear discussion of this problem, as well as a useful discussion of dialogue, can be found in Pelc (1971). I entirely refrain from using another concept from classical narrative theory, the “<span>omniscient narrator</span>”. I find it both fantasmatic and ideologically manipulative to even suppose such a possibility. See Culler (2007) for a definitive critique of that concept and its cognates.</p>
        <p>Benveniste (1966) distinguished between personal and impersonal use of language, for which he used the terms “<span>histoire</span>” and “<span>discours</span>”. Because these terms have given rise to confusion, I have avoided them there. Benveniste’s work, translated into English (1971), remains of fundamental importance. Silverman (1983) offers a wonderful discussion of the usefulness of this theory (among others, many also relevant here) for the subject of this chapter, including for film. Her 1996 book 1996 pursues this direction.</p>
        <p>Ideology and the resulting politics of narrative are difficult to pin down. I would not isolate these from the narrative structures in which they function, as narratologists like Bertens (2001) and Cohan and Shires tend to do (1988). Several examples in this chapter have demonstrated the utility of binding ideology and structure. Memory is another important concept. The useful concept of “<span>multidimensional memory</span>” has been developed by Michael Rothberg (2009). The concept is meant to account for a view of memory that is able to draw similarities between historical catastrophes – most obviously, between slavery and the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>Regarding the difference between “<span>pure</span>” narration and nonnarrative commentary, see Genette (1969), which has appeared in English as “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Boundaries of Narrative</span>”. There are many different views of free indirect discourse. McHale offers a clear survey (1978). Perry (1979) labels the phenomenon “<span>combined discourse</span>”. On text interference, see Doležel (1973). Ron (1981) connects this narrative style to issues of world-making and language games. One competing theory of free indirect speech that explicitly rejects the thesis that all narrative utterances can be attributed to a narrator is worth mentioning. Ann Banfield’s alternative theory views such speeches as “<span>sentences without speaker</span>”, or even “<span>unspeakable sentences</span>” (1982; for a philosophical underpinning, 2000). Strong as this theory is in itself, I cannot accept the elimination of responsibility it entails.</p>
        <p>Dallenbach (1977) wrote an interesting book about mirror-texts. A critical discussion and systematization is offered in Bal (1991). See also Jefferson (1983).</p>
        <p>There is a book (1981) by Hamon about description. Motivation as a strategy is best explained in Culler (1975). This phenomenon is also called “<span>naturalization</span>”. On motivation in postmodern fiction, see Van Alphen (1988); for a good survey of the concept of postmodernism, see Van Alphen (1989). For an in-depth theory of description, see Bal (2004). The example from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightwood</em> is borrowed from it.</p>
        <p>The concept of the narratee is attached to the name of Prince, who decisively integrated it in his book on narratology (1982). For more on dialogue as a principle of language use, see Bakhtin (1981). Peeren (2008) makes Bakhtin’s ideas available for the analysis of popular culture, especially film and television. Todorov’s introduction to Bakhtin’s work is also useful (1984). On intertextuality and interdiscursivity as a more general cultural phenomenon as “<span>recycling</span>”, see Moser (1981) and Moser and colleagues (2016).</p>
        <p>For <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Don Quixote</em> I have used J.M. Cohen’s translation (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1950). Borges’s “<span>Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote</span>” is in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Labyrinths</em> (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1962), 62–71.</p>
        <p>The example of the family accident comes from Arno Bohlmeijer, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Something Very Sorry</em>, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1996). The comments on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beloved</em> are an implicit response to Shlomith Rimmon Kenan (1996). The page numbers refer to Toni Morrison, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beloved</em> (New York: Signet, 1987).</p>
        <p>The example of second-person narrative is from Michel Butor, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em>(Paris: Les Editions de Minuit, 1957). The most important study of this text is Francoise van Rossum-Guyon’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Critique du roman. Essai sur “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">La Modification</span>” de Michel Butor</em> (Paris: Gallimard, 1970), a book-length study that is also a theoretical discussion of narrative structure, but within an earlier, more or less pre-structuralist framework. On secondperson narrative, including Butor’s novel, see Kacandes (1996), who is much more positive about the success of Butor’s experiment than I am. In another important article (1993), she develops second-person narrative specifically in the context of postmodernism.</p>
        <p>The passages from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Budapest Diary</em> are from Susan Rubin Suleiman, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Budapest Diary: In Search of the Motherbook</em> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1996). On the poetics of apostrophe, see Culler (2015), and on the political implications, Johnson (1987). For <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arabian Nights</em>, see the excellent discussion in Khanna (2008).</p>
