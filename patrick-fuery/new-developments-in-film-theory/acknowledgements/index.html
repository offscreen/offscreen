<p>Many kind and generous people contributed a great deal to the writing of this book.</p>
<p>All the people at the publishers were supportive of this project. In particular, Catherine Gray was unfailingly helpful, good humoured, and offered considerably more than editorial advice. Her intelligent suggestions for design, structure, and style were always welcome.</p>
<p>Many friends and colleagues offered support and encouragement, but I would especially like to thank the following: Stella Bruzzi, whose knowledge of film is something to behold - her kindness over coffee and in emails contributed a great deal; Tom Burvill, who always has time, and always gives so much; Joan Kirkby, inspiring and generous, a pleasure to be with; Horst Ruthrof (who must be getting tired of being mentioned in these pages), who always offers the best advice, at the best moment, with such modesty; Sam Tarlington and Robin Burgess, for their irrepressible spirit and friendship (especially at that time late in June); Linda and Paul Wilkins, and Bryan Wilkinson, and my mother, who all suffered my choices of films with such fine humour - and always offer friendship and a solid base of return; and my family, Kelli and Morgan, who bring to my life brightness, laughter, and much love. How does one ever repay that? </p>
<p>Finally, part ofthis book's dedication is to my brother, Martin, whose love of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> will always be a precious memory for me.</p>
