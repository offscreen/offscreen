        <p>Films, like other narrative processes, establish social orders which are constructed from a variety of sources, including the social order of the created world, the socio-historical contexts which the film draws on, the critical contexts of its reception, and the social contexts of the spectator. These orders are all played out within what we might call the architectonics of social orders. Such architectonics (the systematised ordering of knowledges and formations of contexts of meaning) operate within themselves to give relational points to events, people, histories, ethics, etc, within the film and outside of it. Part of this process is the construction of boundaries which delimit and establish the hows and whys of narrative events and objects. Such boundaries, often unacknowledged (as they operate largely at a level of invisibility within the textual fabric and act of reading), most often do not function as restrictive practices, but as moments where difference is mapped in order for it to become part of the spectating process. For when we watch a film we continually oscillate between the film's social world order, the social order it is derived from, and our own. Perhaps such boundaries are limitless, or form part of the unrepresentable, or are ephemeral and specific to a film. But some are more persistent and recurring than others, and the overall structure of such boundaries is common to all films. Of these types some examples include: the boundaries within the films themselves (the represented social order); the boundaries between the film's world order and the wider social environment; and the boundaries between these two social orders of the film and the spectator. The movements and connections between these boundaries, and how the film spectator engages with them, tells us much about film and its relationship to social orders. They are also part of what may be termed shifts in the status of different ontologies.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup> These will be quickly mapped out now so that we can move on to explore more on film's capacity to disrupt and challenge such architectonics.</p>
        <p>The first of these boundaries operates within the film itself. A social order is set up in the diegetics of the film, most often paralleling in some way the historical and ideological order which produced it. This is almost inevitable because even in films that try to represent a social order beyond their historical moment, we still find reproductions of systems such as gender relations, power structures, systems of discourse, moral practices, etc. This boundary of a diegetic social order can be established quickly because of such parallels, and the audience maps out the familiar even in the most unfamiliar of landscapes. The function of this is at least two fold: created world orders can be made sense of because of this operation of the familiar; the films are able to produce dramatic effects by playing with such relationships. The horror films made in the 1980s and 1990s by people such as Wes Craven and Sam Raimi presented an over-familiarised social setting (middle-American suburbia) so that the terror was more intense because of the established and strongly recognisable social contexts; Hitchcock positioned his characters in the ordinary and everyday to make the social disruption more perplexing, one of the best examples of this being <em class="notranslate" translate="no">North by Northwest</em>. It is the absolute bewilderment of Roger Thornhill that makes the threats more sinister. It is not surprising that in such examples <em>we</em> find a strong demonstration of Freud's theory of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unheimlich</em> for the uncanny contains that which is overly familiar, as well as the hidden and strange.</p>
        <p>Even the most seemingly trivial of signs can link the film's narrative order back to a social context beyond itself. This may operate specifically within a social domain (for example, Big Ben or The White House have particular cultural connotations) or it may be intertextually driven. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Clockwork Orange</em> (Kubrick 1971), for example, the rendition of the song <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Singin' in the Rain</em>, within a context so far removed from its Gene Kelly origins, does not negate those roots - if anything they are strengthened precisely because of this dark and sinister moment. Murder, rape, and torture are seeming impossibilities within the 1950s musical, which makes the scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Clockwork Orange</em> more shocking and disturbing. Once such a reference is made, we may pursue more connotations, such as the idea that it is a song which originates from a scene depicting a form of madness (albeit out of romantic love); and it is the watchful gaze of the policeman that halts Kelly's dancing and singing - but not his feelings - just as Alex <em>seems</em> to be halted in his antisocial acts by the panoptic gaze of authority. Such intertextual references vary in how they relate to connections between social orders (either film to film or film to social contexts), but there is usually some point at which we can see this in operation. Furthermore, the trace lines that allow such intertextuality to take place cannot operate solely within the textual field; it is a cultural ordering of things that allows, establishes, and maintains such connections. In other words, the sorts of links made between films are more often played out within a set of cultural paradigms than just the textual references that seem to set them up.</p>
        <p>This is an important point because, as we have noted elsewhere, the range and degree of intertextualities are significant modes in the production of meanings. This class of intertextual references, which are played out almost entirely at the level of the social, may appear the same as those which are predominantly textually driven, but their distinction lies in this basis, and emphasis, of a cultural drive. How a culture organises such links (that is, for example, how they become established as legitimate readings of a film) reveals much of that culture's ideological operations. For example, the Western <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulzana's Raid</em> (Aldrich 1973) is often positioned as a culturally driven intertextual reference to the USA's involvement in the Vietnam war. The intertextuality here is at least threefold: the generic (Westerns and War films); the historical (the events of the Vietnam war - that is, the event as text); the metaphoric/allegorical (the symbolism of images and narrative within the film itself). In these terms the 'meaning' of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulzana's Raid</em> is seen to be developed in at least two of the levels of the film's textual order. However, the interpretation of all such signs is dependent on this intertextual cultural context. This is emphasised further when the idea of a generic history is mapped out, with such a film marking a genre being redefined by a current social context. This is part of the relationship between the film's created social order, and the wider cultural contexts.</p>
        <p>Part of the function of this created social order is to provide the moral contexts in which the narrative of the film takes place. In many cases it is the portrayal of a character (or set of events) which operate outside of the moral context which is used to define them (that is, the spectator is given the social order through its oppositions). This is a very common device, delivering narrative force as well as building up the film's social order. The sociopathic and psychopathic Hannibal Lecter in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Silence of the Lambs</em> does this at the level of social order (which is the diegetic Symbolic) by running counter to all of its moral codes, and at the level of the psychic order by entering into the (mostly repressed) memories and emotions of FBI agent Starling. In both cases Lecter exposes the moral order and social organisation by being a more extreme version of what is portrayed. He is presented as a natural product of such a social order, not so much an aberration but more a variation on the morals represented. His capacity to operate for most of the time as a reasonable, sensitive and even enlightened person allows him to function (diegetically speaking) as a reflection of the social order as it is transgressed and warped. That the depicted social order is closely aligned to a recognisable one (late capitalist USA with hierarchies of order and power, male dominated, etc) means that his transgressions operate within a double context of crossing the boundaries of his social order, and crossing the boundaries of the culture which produced the film (which includes much of its audience). In a curious way Agent Starling also acts transgressively as it is her gender which is used to question some of the hierarchical structures of power.</p>
        <p>This relates to the second type of carnivalesque disruption of social orders, which involves those between the film's social order and a wider social environment. (We have already encountered much of how this takes place in the previous chapter, so a few short examples will suffice here.) At its most simple level this is when film challenges the Symbolic, perhaps most clearly demonstrated in terms of morality and ethics. What can <em>be</em> represented, and how things are represented, always remains an area of contention. The abjection and violence in Pasolini's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Salo</em>, the sexual politics of Bertolucci's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Tango in Paris</em> (1973), the reflexivity of sex and death in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Peeping Tom</em>, the problems of paedophile acts in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lolita</em> (Kubrick 1962), and the horror of fascism in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Triumph of the Will</em> (Riefenstahl 1935) all represent, although in quite different ways, the challenge that films can present to the established social order. What is useful to ask is how might this be different (or the same) from the example of boundaries presented above. This is a difference based on the disruption of a social order within the film, and a disruption outside of the film. In one sense it could be argued that this is part of the function of film within its social context. Film often represents what happens when the social order is challenged, disrupted, or inverted; and watching this is part of the pleasure because we know that what is being played out has a certain reality, but one that is textually based. However, even the most ardent supporter of propaganda (to take a specific example) recognises that there are strict limitations on any text's capacity to change people's attitudes towards social orders, such as moral and ethical actions, quite apart from changing the orders themselves.</p>
        <p>Outside of this is another process which would see film's disruptive operations as a necessary part of the evolution of the social world order. By exposing that which is transgressive, film also reveals the ideological operation of moral and ethical codes, of representations of gender, race, of the systems of power. In short, the interaction between the social order and film is played out as part of a meta-carnivalesque (see below) which attempts to produce knowledges about that very order and how it functions. Such an interpretation is located between the idea that texts represent and/or reflect the ideological order (almost in the classical Marxist sense), and that they have the capacity to actively intervene in it (as the theories of Brecht, for example, argue).</p>
        <p>The third type of boundary - that between the filmic order and the spectator's - is the one where we will often witness different individual relational contexts brought to bear. For in the boundary between film and culture there is a clear delineation between textual world orders and other types (such as the social) in which connections can <em>be</em> made or seen; in the boundaries within a film itself there is a common point of ontological existence, so that even if the boundaries are broken or transgressed this very act becomes part of the film's textual order. However, the spectator and the film always operate at a unique and individual level, even within these larger contexts. For the spectator acknowledges the textual world order of the film (and all its specifications), and operates within at least one of the cultural orders. These include the cultural order of the production of the film (that is, the historical and ideological moment of the film's genesis); or the cultural order of the reception of the film (that is, a film watched within the context of its cultural reception); or the cultural order of the critical analysis of the film (that is, how a film is positioned critically - such as art-house, popular, obscene, sublime); or the cultural order of its interpretation (that is, that films are seen to mean specific things in various contexts).</p>
        <p>There is a beyond to all of these, which is the spectator's own position within those different, but ultimately interconnected, cultural contexts. For no matter how powerful such contexts are (and they do have a great force) there will also <em>be</em> microcosms of spectator positions, some derived from these contexts, others products of individual histories and psychical sites. White, racist skinheads watching <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Romper Stomper</em> (Wright 1992) may well observe all of the social contexts with which the film engages, but their reactions to it are most likely to be quite different from those of other parts of the audience that do not share their political views. Such a spectator may see no irony in Rando as a tragically heroic figure, while others will see nothing but vicious fascism in the character. Such interpretations are heavily influenced by the other social and textual contexts, but there must also be a point where what the spectator sees, and how he/she reacts, is derived from the unique position of their subjectivity. This is the interplay between the Lyotardian Grand Narratives of cultural contexts, and the explosion of countless little narratives, some of which are sustained while others quickly fade away. These little narratives allow deviation and difference, rather than the sense of identity figured in the Grand N arratives. These meta-narratives challenge all narrating positions in their production of a multiplicity of positions and perspectives.</p>
        <p>It is not so simple to say that certain films will match certain spectators, and so the different textual, cultural, and individual contexts will match, ideologies are made more compliant, and then pleasure is derived. At the very least such an equation is problematic at the level of pleasure, for that which is pleasurable might be obtained precisely from a position of antagonism or difference. One of the things that this idea of textual and spectator positions does reveal is how dynamic the act of watching films is, and how impossible any alignment within this process is. Part of this can be read in terms of phenomenology's concept of quasi-judgements. These are related to the distinctions made between those actions and events in a text, such as film, and those that take place in the outside 'real' world. We do not race out of the theatre and call the police when Norman Bates stabs Marion in the shower, yet our emotional reactions of horror and fear demonstrate that at least on one level such events mean something. The fictional quality of these judgements gives them a quasi-real status, but in doing so disallows a binarism of truth and fiction. The question then arises as to what is the relationship between the textual world order of quasi-judgements and socio-historical events. Clearly this is something that is mediated to a large part in the act of reading/spectating.</p>
        <p>Of course these three types of boundaries (not forgetting that there are always others in operation) work as part of a larger matrix, from which we derive the relational contexts and readings of social orders. It is also important to remember that they all work <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in potentia</em> and in-process; that is, the persistence of such orders (and their operation) means that the spectator comes to expect them (even ifit is at a disguised level), and they can never be strictly defined systems or characteristics. By this is meant that the interaction with all social orders (from the created world order of the films to the lived world order of the spectator which repositions the signs of the film) is a constantly changing one, never fixed and certain. A specific example will help to illustrate how we can observe all three boundaries and positionalities in operation, and this quality of the social order in-process.</p>
        <p>An often cited film to illustrate the cinematic 'attachment' to outside events and histories is Rossellini's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rome, Open City</em> (1945). There is a certain ease to which we can map these sorts of connections: the immediacy of the represented events of occupied Rome by Nazi Germany (and the knowledge that such events took place); the filming of sequences on location (as opposed to the relative artificiality of studios); the grainy quality of filming and the documentary style of the film material; the constant reminders of actual places, events and, in their sense of anonymity, people, etc. Interwoven with this are the narrativised sequences - the children, the romance, the subterfuge, the resistance to oppression and evil. It is this relatively seamless matching of the two orders that gives so much power to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rome, Open City</em>. Ifwe were to draw up a spectrum of the film's engagement with the boundaries between its own social order (the events and diegetics of the film) and that of the outside world (Italy in the last years of the Second World War, or Rome as interpreted by Rossellini), then we find specific sequences in the film where the two are most carefully acknowledged and negotiated. Which is not to say that this is not taking place more or less all of the time, but there are points where such issues of the diversity of social orders are foregrounded. In those scenes the constructions of the filmic signs are positioned outside of the ontological orders of both the historico-social context and the created world order of the film. One such example of this is the shooting of Pina.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a2"><a href="#fn:a2">2</a></sup> It is not simply the emotional construction of the act (the callous murder of a pregnant woman; the death of a figure who represented romantic love; the killing of a mother), or the idea that these sorts of things take place in war, or the quality of newsreel footage that the scene evokes, which makes this sequence a collocated junction of the different boundaries of social orders. In part it is the style of the way in which it is filmed - the action is much faster, the camera moves far more quickly than it does in most of the film, Pina runs in a disturbing fashion and is swept up by the priest in a motion almost too rapid. Such a visually distinctive set of constructions positions the whole event as neither part of the careful pacing of the film, nor the deliberate realism of the social context. It has a sense of disruption in both social orders (that is, the film's as well as the historically located ones). It also disrupts the social order of the spectator, as he/she must renegotiate this scene as something beyond the film's narrative and historical orders. Such actions by the spectator ensure the in-process of the boundaries of the social orders because it marks out the differences of the ontological orders, and the unique position that film has in representing and creating them.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dialogism and Social Inversion</h3>
        <p>The act of watching a film is in itself a participation in a type of carnivalesque - that moment where the social restrictions and constructed orders, the established laws and hierarchies, are forgone and the potential for inversion is allowed. In some ways this cinematic carnivalesque does operate like much of the other forms of this social release (the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">carnivale</em>, the Gay and Lesbian <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mardi Gras</em> parades) in that it can been seen as a type of hegemonic control. For although the social order might be challenged and usurped for that period of time involved in watching a film, what is represented and experienced is still restricted within a larger context of the Symbolic and its Law, as well as an adherence to specific formats of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself. So even though we witness all kinds of social disruption when we watch films (murder, unrestrained sexuality, immoral acts, comic interventions on life, people breaking into song and dance) the sorts of boundaries discussed above must be negotiated and maintained. It is important to recognise that the carnivalesque can be located in either the formal aspects, or the thematics of the text, or, perhaps as is most often the case, in both. Considering how variations on these three become articulated in film will help us move towards understanding another facet of cinema's relationships to social order.</p>
        <p>To grasp the idea of a cinematic carnivalesque we also need to take into account Bakhtin's idea of dialogism, particularly in terms of Kristeva's readings. This inflection towards Kristeva's interpretation is important because it accommodates a broader perspective than the original linguistic one of the Russian Formalists and (although to a lesser extent) Bakbtinhimself. Kristeva is interested in the social and psychoanalytic dimensions of dialogism, as well as the textual. When she links Bakhtin with Benveniste in terms of discourse and social practice, extending the dimensions of dialogism to include 'both subjectivity and communication' (Kristeva 1984a: 68), the emphasis shifts from an almost purely textual concern, to one which necessarily includes the subject in his/her social contexts. So at one level dialogism means a discursive practice, bound up with the positionings of the subject in terms of specific social practices. At another level it is a multiplicity of languages, opposed to monologism in its resistance to certainty and authority, offering alternative systems of meaning and knowledge. Part of this operation is what Kristeva, via Bakhtin, describes as the polyphonic. Once more her emphasis is on the literary, but the fecundity of the ideas makes them of interest to film studies. The polyphonic is, as the term suggests, defined by its multiplicity; it is that which, according to Kristeva, incorporates carnivalesque structures (Kristeva l 984a: 71).</p>
        <p>At this point we need to ask if the very terms of 'dialogism' and 'polyphonic' are suitable for film; after all their origins and theoretical intent are firmly based in the literary. To answer such a question <em>we</em> need to recognise that film, perhaps even more than its literary counterparts, has even greater dialogism and polyphony, at both its level of discourse, as well as in its visuals. Together these represent the filmic structure of the carnivalesque. If, as Kristeva puts it, 'Dialogism is not "freedom to say anything," it is a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dramatic</em> "banter", ... an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">other</em> imperative than that of O' (Kristeva 1984a: 71), then film has, potentially, a continual flow of this banter at all the levels of its narrative - the structural, social representations, the visual, etc. The sorts of films that most readily fit this description are those that operate where images, dialogue, narrative, and representations are both enfolded and yet resistant to one another. In other words, film has the potential to set up dialogic and polyphonic processes within individual strands (such as within the images) or across strands (such as image against sound, social context against dialogue). Some specific examples will help to illustrate this.</p>
        <p>The carnivalesque is resistant to definition - a resistance premised at least partly on the mutability of the form. However, there are often certain attributes that mark the carnivalesque in film, or styles and themes that we come to recognise as part of this other order. Similarly, certain directors leap to mind when the term carnivalesque is used. Fellini, early Rivette, Bu:fiuel, J eunet and Caro, Polanski, Pasolini, Cavani, certainly Godard, Greenaway, Cronenberg, Wertmuller, Gilliam are all examples of directors where we find a recurring engagement with either carnivalesque themes or styles, and often both. Such a list is not intended to suggest homogeneity in the films themselves or between the directors, for such an idea would edge towards a sort of generic ideal, and this would be a difficult line to defend. That said, it is possible to indicate some of these recurring points, all the while acknowledging that there is more often difference than similarity. Another significant point within this context is that we might wish to speak of different types of carnivalesque, sharing some qualities, but markedly different in others. To give an idea of the sorts of qualities that can be seen as constitutive of the carnivalesque the following list is indicative, but by no means comprehensive. Similarly, these features are common in formations of the carnivalesque, but they are not exclusive to it, and their function will vary in many ways according to the filmic contexts. Such a list of features includes the following.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(a) Representations of excess</em></h3>
        <p>This is often expressed in terms of the body and its distorted engagement with the world, such as eating, drinking, and sexual activity. In this way the carnivalesque is used to play on what are seen as normal, healthy activities, and pushes them to extremes. Ferreri's film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Grande Bouffe</em> is the perverse narrative of how three men set out to eat themselves to death, but does so with a sort of calm deliberation. It is this calmness within all the excesses that makes the whole process more carnivalesque, perhaps even more than the actual eating. Compare this to the almost hysterical carnivalesque of Robinson's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Withnail and I</em> (1987) which presents a continual flow of excesses, especially in terms of drinking and attitudes towards sexual difference. (The opening scene captures this when 'I' sits in the sordid coffee shop watching a greasy, runny egg squirt from bread, and reads about trans-sexuality; but there are almost continuous images of this type throughout.) The sexuality in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Tango in Paris</em> is not necessarily excessive (although it did challenge many of the filmic and social conventions of both mainstream and art-house cinemas at its time of release), but the way that sexuality is treated, and the contexts in which it is played out (an aging man and young woman, the demands for total anonymity, the brutal force of the sex contrasted with the almost naive romantic love of the young couple, the entwining of images of sex and death), gives it some sense of the carnivalesque. One of the defining qualities of such excess in a carnivalesque context is the almost matter of fact attitude of the participants. In all these examples of eating, drinking and sexual acts there is an almost detached manner in which most of the central characters act. Excess is not seen as such in the carnivalesque, but rather as the natural order of things in this inverted social order.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(b) Dream-like qualities to the narrative sequences and settings</em></h3>
        <p>Rather than a theme (although of course it can be thematic as well), this quality is most often played out in the style of the film. Carnivalesque <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> will often not distinguish dream-like sequences from the everyday, or may establish only a rudimentary sense of the outside world before creating this other, phantastic region. Polanski's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">What?</em> (1973) has only a brief opening and closing sequence of the outside world before locating the Alice-like woman into the house filled with madness and Art. The frame-tale device is almost mechanical in its position in the narrative. Similarly, the various house scenes in Rivette's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Celine and Julie Go Boating</em> (1973) contain a mixture of Art, fiction, the cinematic, and dreams, none of which are distinguished within that world order. The frame is abandoned here, which is a construction common to most of Rivette's films. Such orders reflect what Kristeva sees as part of the transgressive quality of the carnivalesque, which succeeds 'because it accepts another law' (Kristeva l 984a: 71). These other settings have their own internal logics and laws, which may well be a sort of Borgesian law of breaking all laws!</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(c) Themes of social disruption</em></h3>
        <p>A point such as this highlights one of the difficulties of attempting to articulate the carnivalesque. At one level almost all <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> could be said to deal with socially disruptive themes (and for that matter a great deal of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> could be said to be excessive, dream-like, etc), so does this make all <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> carnivalesque, and if that is so, does it then make this particular aspect redundant as a critical tool? Or do we limit our classification of this strictly in terms of films that demonstrate a specific <em class="notranslate" translate="no">use</em> of such a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">theme</em> within a sensibility of the carnivalesque? Furthermore, are we primarily concerned with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">representation</em> of social disruption, or cinema's capacity to disrupt the social environment of the spectator? There are no short answers to such questions (in some ways these are the questions that this entire discussion is about), but part of our negotiation of them must include the idea that certain films invest more in this disruptive quality, be that thematically, in their style, or both. The representation of a socially disruptive event (such as revolutions, wars, political instability) is clearly not in itself carnivalesque, although there are certain films that might be considered as such. Costa-Gavras's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Z</em> (1969) with its mix of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> <em class="notranslate" translate="no">virite</em> and innovative narrative style, and a specific political currency, is a good example of a film that challenges the monologic approach to political commentary and the thriller. The idea that film can be socially disruptive at a political level (derived at least in part from the theories of Brecht) is a force that drives much of Godard's work.</p>
        <p>Another way of approaching this idea is to consider film's disruption of social practices through different carnivalesque devices and structures. Established social practices such as sexuality, gender roles, the positioning of the elderly or young, are often challenged in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> through excess, the fantastic, the grotesque, etc. What this potentially achieves is a polyphony of ways of thinking about such social practices - that is, film has the potential to reinscribe the social by making it other to what is normally experienced. Gilliam's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Brazil</em> (1985) works on both levels of representing a socially disturbed world, disrupted in different ways; and a perverse paralleling of the bureaucratic world of late capitalism. In doing so it has the possibility of challenging the spectator's own sense of his/her position in the bureaucratic schema of things.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(d) Dark comic humour</em></h3>
        <p>The carnivalesque is often infested with a humour that is derived from the compulsive and repulsive. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Withnail and I</em> details the carnivalesque through its Rabelaisian humour, piling one comic moment on another to produce a sort of despair that is almost trivial in its origins, but all-encompassing to its main characters, especially in Withnail, who is one of the best examples of a reinvention of the Rabelaisian figure in contemporary cinema. In this film we see the operation of the doubling effect, not so that there is a carnivalesque moment to be contrasted with one from the rational, monologic world; rather there is a polyphonic discharge where the images and events challenge each other within the carnivalesque. 3 The dark representation of Uncle Monty in such homophobic terms is undercut by Withnail's laments as a lover towards I at the very end of the film (note his emphasis on Shakespeare's 'and I love him'); the bravado of Withnail is always contrasted with greater masculine violence (in the pub, with Danny the drug dealer, with the bull in the field, with the poacher) that results in a comic excess. The film's narrative is derived from, and propelled by, the polyphony of comic compulsions and repulsions. In a similar way Wertmuller's films play out a warped version of recognisable stereotypes so that the carnivalesque comic is only a slight twist on normal relationships <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Swept Away</em> (Wertmuller 1975) is an example of this in terms of gender roles). Almod6- var's characters - such as the kidnapper and the porn star in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down</em> (1990), the mother and daughter in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Heels</em> (1991), and the television presenter, Andrea Scarface, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kika</em> (1993) - work in a similar way at the level of the carnivalesque because they present extremes of certain cultural and gender types.</p>
        <p>Another way of approaching this sort of carnivalesque attribute would be to examine how certain combinations of elements actually transform the essential quality of the relationships, acts, or social orders. This dark humour of the camivalesque can transform violence, for example, into an order of excess. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em> (Ritchie 1998) takes the acts of violence (both the literal acts of killing and torture, as well as the implied) to such an extreme that it becomes more about excess than blood. In doing so the darkness of the humour does not function as a form of relief from the violence for the spectator (as is so often the case in thrillers and horror films), but rather it feeds into the transforming of the signifiers as moments of excess.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(e) A resistance to laws</em></h3>
        <p>Part of the drive of the carnivalesque, that is, its reason for existence, is to invert the laws of the social order. As Kristeva points out: 'The carnivalesque challenges God, authority, and social law; in so far as it is dialogical, it is rebellious' (Kristeva 1984a: 79). Often this is done in a fashion that is so absurd and extreme that the very discourse created is the defence against censorship. The form feigns to declare itself invalid by presenting antisocial ideas (in a mainstream sense) through the comic, the parodic, and the excessive. However in doing so the carnivalesque allows itself the capacity to provide resistance to the laws (the moral and ethical as well as the legal) which operate both within the created world order and the outside social order of the viewer. Once more it is important to recognise that one of the distinguishing features of this is not the establishing of an alternative system of laws, for the carnivalesque more often attacks the existing social codes without offering other possibilities except the comic and excessive. There are variations to this, but generally speaking the anarchy of the Marx Brothers in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Duck Soup</em> (Mc Carey 1933), for example, is more carnivalesque in these terms than Altman's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">M*A*S*H</em> (1970). For although both films have a sense of political satire, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Duck Soup</em> is more directed as satirising other anti-war films than producing something like an anti-war sentiment as found in Altman's film.</p>
        <p>The idea of resistance to laws can be also be taken at a formal level, with some carnivalesque texts demonstrating a concerted effort at breaking down established structures. One way of interpreting this is through Kristeva's ideas on dialogue. She states: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">'Dialogue</em> appears most clearly in the structure of carnivalesque language, where symbolic relationships and analogy take precedence over substance-causality connections' (Kristeva 1984a: 72). Once films break down the substance-causality connections - that is, the fundamentally given of narrative sequences - then there is a direct challenge to the laws of narrative itself. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Year at Marienbad</em> pushes such laws to the extreme so that all the usual constructions of narrative (past, present, future; cause and effect; time as measurable and constant structure; the memory of the narrating position as reliable; relationships between characters stable unless the shifts are marked out, etc) give way to the Symbolic ideas of narrative, and analogies of cause and effect. More tentatively, we might argue that the early use of the jumpcut works as a carnivalesque interruption of the laws of narrative and editing. To include such an interpretation would suggest that the carnivalesque can be found in small elements of a film, and not always developed in all aspects of the film. In thissense we might read the jump-cut as carnivalesque in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">About de souffle</em>, but resist the idea that the entire film can be seen as such. It operates as carnivalesque because it mostly works outside of any narrative attachment. When there is a jump-cut there is not necessarily a corresponding relationship to changes in events on the screen or the characters' emotions. It could be argued that this is precisely what the jumpcut is - at least in the hands of Godard - but to see it as carnivalesque is to invest it with this sense of resistance to the law of montage.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(f) Figures of the grotesque</em></h3>
        <p>Part of the historical tradition of the carnivalesque is the grotesque. There are differences (one is not always the other), nor can they simply be seen as subcategories of each other. However, the connections are often present, enforced as much by the shared histories as by specific textual references and reading practices. Lynch is one director whose films <em class="notranslate" translate="no">seem</em> bound to the figures of the grotesque. Films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Eraserhead</em> (1978), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wild at Heart</em> (1990) in different ways demonstrate connections between the grotesque and carnivalesque. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Elephant Man</em> (1980) works less like these, even if its theme is, almost literally, about a carnivalesque character, because it sets up the differences within the film itself, whereas the other three examples contain a world order devised of the carnivalesque itself. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lost Highway</em> (1997) returns to the figures found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Veluet</em> (the bewildered young man, the sexually alluring and mysterious woman, the threatening older man with pathological gangster attributes), but locates the figures of the grotesque in a much less black-and-white scenario. These character types are something like an embodiment of the darker drives, a sort of Hollywood version of the Freudian drives of sex and death. In a different way Cronenberg's films have a recurring image of the grotesque, often based on the body made abject. These films combine a type of technological grotesque to produce the carnivalesque of the body. His visions of the body transformed into a machine resist the comforts of seamless mergings found in some science fiction cinema, and instead play out the grotesque. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Crash</em> is one of the best examples of this, although <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Videodrome</em> (1983) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Existenz</em> (1999) demonstrate similar ideas and attitudes. Compare these to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Terminator</em> (Cameron 1984), for example, which has the merged body/machine and, although threatening, is never of the same order of the grotesque. What makes these sorts of manifestations of the grotesque different in such camivalesque settings is, like with the representation of excesses, they are not seen as such by the subjects in the films. There is fascination, perhaps disturbance, but not the revulsion or resistance found in horror or thriller genres.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(g) Liminal spaces</em></h3>
        <p>We have noted above how certain films establish dream-like settings where the elements of the camivalesque are played out. There is also the division of spaces into liminal zones where social inversion operates within the world order. Once more, one of the distinguishing features of this is that these spaces are not in themselves always marked out as difference. For this reason, something like Alex Proyas's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dark City</em> (1998), where there are explanations offered to the social inversions of the city, has a different sense of the carnivalesque from that of the dark recesses of cities such as those found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">City of Lost Children</em> (Jeune! and Caro 1995) or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A zed and Two Noughts</em> (Greenaway 1985) where the warped social environment is the norm. In different ways these sorts of films rely on the viewer recognising the particularity of the created, anonymous cityscape and urban environments, and at the same time seeing distortion and inversion of their own. The city is a particularly strong motif in these terms, but there are also equivalent rural regions. The crop-dusting scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">North-by-Northwest</em> has a certain carnivalesque feel about it, one character pointing out the strangeness of dusting where there are no crops. Fellini's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">City of Women</em> (1981) plays with both the rural and the urban to mark out a phallocentric version of a feminine carnivalesque. It is the quality of the familiar and the strange which makes these regions liminal, because to occupy a site which crosses the two social orders of the film and the spectator there must be nodal points of recognition and disjunction.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">(h) Historically recognisable but distorted time periods</em></h3>
        <p>As with the invention of disturbed and strange spaces that at once connect and disconnect to regions outside of the film, the carnivalesque also plays with temporality. It does this in many different ways <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Last Tear at Marienbad</em> as cited above can be seen to be doing carnivalesque things with time). Apart from the more obvious temporal distortions, another way <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> constructs the carnivalesque is by creating times and scenes that have recognisable historical currency (perhaps even veracity within the social order) and then inverting or disrupting this sense of the period. Cavani reworks elements of Nazi Europe in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Night Porter</em> by positing the enormity of the tragedy into a single relationship. And it is in this relationship that the carnivalesque is played out in sadistic and masochistic terms. Similarly, her <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Beyond Good and Evil</em> (1977) mixes historical figures (such as Nietzsche and Lou-Andres Salome) with sequences of carnivalesque dance that are also found in the woman's act in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Night Porter</em>. Other examples of this distorting of time periods include Pasolini's Middle Ages in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">TheDecameron</em> (1971) and Chaucer's England in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Canterbury Tales</em> (1971).Jarman's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Caravaggio</em> (1986) plays out the jarring effect of including modern artifacts (such as a watch) on historical figures.</p>
        <p>All of these devices work at different levels in the film text. In doing so the carnivalesque <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> sets up an alternative to the cinematic 'language' of both form and content. It reinvents itself as a double to that which is seen as the cinematic discourse. This doubling effect is important because it textually distinguishes and connects (often through a type of intertextuality) the dialogic and polyphonic processes to the cinematic paradigm, rather than posing it as difference. In other words, such processes provide a way of considering <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as a socially disruptive force in itself. To understand further how this takes place, we can now turn to another aspect of disruption.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Reality Effect</h3>
        <p>Film's connections to reality have produced a long tradition of ideas on what this relationship might be, how it differs from other textual forms, how it shapes the very processes of the cinematic apparatus, etc. Part of this issue is, of course, to do with 'realism', but the implications of it resonate throughout the very idea of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself. By considering this relational context of reality and realism we shall be able to speculate further on some of the connections between film and its social orders. For in these connections and contexts are formulated textual practices (notions of the real and realism) as well as cultural attitudes and acts of reading.</p>
        <p>Much of the theorising of film and ideology has been based on figuring the relationship between <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and reality.• A significant reason for this is not that a realist mode has anything more particularly invested in the cultural processes of ideology, but rather that it can appear to have. The realist mode <em class="notranslate" translate="no">appears</em> to be more real, which is more motivated (in a semiotic sense) and attached to 'reality', and so has a certain relationship to ideology. Part of the reason for this is that ideology i tselfoperates as ifi tis part of the natural order, and in doing so makes the cultural appear natural. Here we see one particular inflection of film's relationship to its materiality. All film strives for this sense of'reality'. Even the most fantastic of films, such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Un Chien andalou, Twelve Monkeys</em>, or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">City of Lost Children</em>, produce a sense of reality within their textual order of things. However, this sense of reality, and how it operates, what effects it has, what textual motivation drives it (and allows it to exist), varies dramatically across films, film forms, and genres. If this is so, we at least need to try to make sense of the relationship between reality, realism, the real, and all of their effects, if only in terms of their social implications and textual systems.</p>
        <p>One way of approaching the issue of the construction of reality in the text is to consider its function against its form. This is to argue that realism operates as a certain function within the text, independent of its proximity to any sense of outside reality. Something has the attribute of realism ifit fulfils this function and not necessarily ifit is realistic. So, for example, time travel has a level of (and investment in) realism in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Twelve Monkeys</em>, even if we do not accept it outside of the parameters of the film. Barthes, in discussing what he terms the reality effect, asks the following question: 'is everything in the narrative meaningful, significant? And if not, if there exist insignificant stretches, what is, so to speak, the ultimate significance of this insignificance?' (Barthes 1982: 12). His answer is the reality effect, and these additions give a sense of reality to the entire narrative. In the example of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Twelve Monkeys</em>, it is the elaborate machines, the dehumanised scientists, the special effects, that have this insignificant signification to produce a sense of the reality of travelling through time. In themselves these signifiers are meaningless and insignificant to the overall narrative of the film; but in their insignificance they come to construct reality.</p>
        <p>Barthes's idea of the reality effect is premised on a whole new formulation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">vraisemblance</em>, and, he argues, represents a total break in the traditional systems of realism in a text. In film we encounter a specific development of this reality effect. The key to this effect is the new order's intention to 'alter the tripartite nature of the sign so as to make the descriptive notation a pure encounter between the object and its expression' (Barthes 1982: 16). Or, to disentangle Barthes's semiotic language, the reality effect we encounter in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> challenges the old textual order of the relationship between sign and referent so that we actually have to devise new strategies for understanding and analysing the textual construction of realism. In a different way this is what Lyotard argues in his analysis of postmodernism. He draws specifically on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to work through 'the effects of reality, or if one prefers, the fantasies of realism' (Lyotard 1984: 73). Lyotard's 'equivalence' (a dangerous term here) to Barthes's idea of a totally new relational context of the sign to realism is found in postmodernism and 'the withdrawal of the real' and participates in 'the business not to supply reality but to invent illusions' (Lyotard 1984: 123) - which also operates as a more than useful definition of cinema's relationship to realism and reality.</p>
        <p>There are a number of different orders of reality which come into play when we watch a film. There is the reality of trees and chairs and tables, or what phenomenology calls the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lebenswelt</em>, forming part of the natural attitude. This is the 'reality' we would usually associate with the term; the reality of our everyday existence. There is also what might be called the 'socio-reality', or that reality formulated in and through the social order of things. This is an ideological-based reality which is continually asserted as ifit is part of the first order of objects and the everyday. This is how ideological 'reality' must operate if it is to escape scrutiny, and in doing so allows ideological systems to function within the everyday. A third order is produced from this which we will call 'epistemic reality', or that reality which produces and is produced by systems of knowledge. This is the construction of reality as if it is a knowledge-based process, and so 'truth'. As with socio-reality, this version of reality ends up producing interpretations which are not necessarily based on any actual reality. It is part of what Nietzsche pointed out in regard to truth when he said that truth is just a metaphor that has forgotten its status: 'truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they <em>are</em> illusions' (Nietzsche 1964: 1 72). The fourth version of reality is 'psychical reality', which comes close to what Lacan called the Real. This is the reality that is formulated out of the interplay and differences between the unconscious and the conscious mind. The unconscious - driven by desires and drives - has a different reality from the socially orientated conscious mind, moderated by the actions of the super-ego and the ego ideal.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a5"><a href="#fn:a5">5</a></sup> It is also the reality of the split subject as he/ she negotiates a position of subjectivity in the Symbolic order. As Lacan puts it: 'What is refused in the Symbolic order re-emerges in the Real' (Lacan 1993: 13), which allows him to <em>attach</em> the Real on to that which lies outside of the reality constructed in the cultural order. Such a construction is well suited to explore the cinematic constructions and operations of the Real.</p>
        <p>What such a model suggests is that all the forms of reality listed so far contain within them a constructed set of interpretations which are driven not simply by their constitutive elements (the trees-and-chairs part of them, so to speak) but by the desires of the subjectivities through and in which they operate. This suggests a fifth level of reality, that of the subject's reality. This is derived from the subject's position within all these other orders of reality, and the sorts of impacts that that has on how we construct, accept (or deny), and participate in the other orders. Gender, race, class, sexuality are all influences on how this subject reality is formulated and engaged in. The final version of reality we are concerned with here is filmic reality, which is constructed out of at least two very large orders. The first are the realities of a film derived from that particular film's narrative, style, history, position in the industry, etc. That is, this is the reality of the film's constructed world order, and how that order, in turn, is intertextually connected to lots of other films. The second order is the construction of a film's reality out of a culmination of elements from these other realities.</p>
        <p>What this interweaving of different realms indicates is that film's reality is derived not simply from its textual order, but from a complex interplay between a vast and subtle series of factors, including the social, subjective, epistemological, and psychical. The point where all these meet is in the spectating position - where the film is realised through, and combined with, the spectator's levels of reality. What this also means is that film's relationship to 'reality' is far more complex than at first might <em class="notranslate" translate="no">seem</em> to be the case. We can return to a specific example in order to illustrate this: one that isseen to have a particular relationship to Realism (as a textual order) and reality, that is the film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rome, Open City</em>.</p>
        <p>The sequence that will be the focus here is one touched on earlier, and comes mid-way through the film. The Nazis have raided the block of flats where the two resistance fighters have been hiding out; the priest Don Pietro has been called by the local children to the scene and, under the pretext of visiting a sick old man, enters the building just as the Nazis are commencing their search. Don Pietro discovers one of the children with a gun and bomb, threatening to use them against the Nazi troops; Don Pietro hides the weapons in the old man's bed (after knocking him unconscious with a frying pan) and fools the soldiers. After this scene the camera returns to the crowd on the street below. Francesco and Pina, separated by the Nazis, recognise each other and call out. Francesco is forcefully placed on a truck with the other prisoners and Pina, hysterical with grief, runs down the street after the truck, only to be shot by the Nazi troops. Don Pietro gathers her fallen body up from the cobblestones, and her son is pulled from her body, before there is a cut to the convoy of trucks and the prisoners.</p>
        <p>One of the interesting things about this whole sequence is how it interweaves various combinations of oppositions. The first set of shots (the priest and the old man) is presented in an almost Classical Hollywood style. There are rapid cuts of the priest and small boy coming down the stairs as the Nazis come up; there are odd angles and strong use of bars (from the stairs) to heighten the tension and operate metaphorically for entrapment and danger; there are extra-diagetic sounds and parts of the narrative that only become clear afterwards (how did the priest manage to pacify the old man? what was the strange sound of metal as the shot of the Nazi officer looking into a doorway occupies the screen? These sorts of questions are only resolved when the boy holds up the frying pan and exclaims how hard the priest had hit the old man). All of these elements produce strong narrative effects and the comic, almost high farce. There is also the sense of triumph, as the priest has outwitted the Nazi, saved the boys, and perhaps helped the resistance fighters to escape. The following shots in the street actually reveal that they have not managed to do this, and the contrast is remarkable as the tone moves from the comic (Pina's slapping of the Nazi guard) to the tragic (her death on the street). The filming in this second sequence becomes much more like newsreel footage, particularly when the priest gathers up Pina's body. Here the lighting, the pace and the camera's movement all contribute to a style that comes to define Italian Neo-realism as oppositional (or at least different) to the Classical Hollywood tradition.</p>
        <p>Having described these two scenes (and it is interesting that they are located in the film next to one another because so much of their effect is derived from this positioning and its force of contrast) in this way, it is also important to realise that such effects (of narrative and style, of realism and Hollywoodism, of the comic and tragic) are all derived from an interplay of the versions of reality detailed above. In other words, we need to take into account how such scenes are produced in the act of watching the film via the different realities that the spectator draws on. The first of these - the reality of objects - is based here on <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rome, Open City</em> as a 'record' of events and spaces at the end of the Second World War. Much is made of the fact that the film takes place on the streets and in the buildings of a Rome that existed at a (historically established and defined) point in time. This gives the status of the film a particular relationship to that first order of reality of objects, because it suggests that the objects are somehow more real than the artifice of objects in other films. This is the relationship denoted by the code system of'documentary' and even 'docu-drama'. However, once we bring to bear the socio-reality (of both the Italian Neorealists and the generations of spectators which follow) and the epistemic reality, then this relationship shifts from one of reality to realism. What is meant by this is that it is the realities of the social orders and systems of knowledge which construct the relationships of reality within a form known as realism. Here we begin to approach Baudrillard's ideas of the simulacra, and this is an issue to which we shall return in a moment.</p>
        <p>These orders of reality, and the formations of realism, operate in the subject's reality (derived in part from the psychic realities, in part from the social and cultural contexts of the reader, and in part from the reading competence), and this is how we, as film spectators, negotiate sequences like this one in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rome, Open City</em>. There may well be this construction of differences in the sequences which produce the comic and tragic, the narrative style of Hollywood and the documentary style of news footage. However, it is not enough to see these interpretations as constructed simply out of the film itself. It is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">conflation</em> and intersection ofrealities which produce these filmic differences and emotive effects; it is in the space of the spectator's construction of the film, which necessarily contains and often sustains such realities, where differences are formed. This is the case because within each of these realities there is a vast amount of contradiction and heterogeneity. No realm of reality is uniform in eitherits materiality (that is, what it includes as 'real') or its interpretative gestures (that is, what a 'real' element means and how it is understood to have that status), or its status of significance.</p>
        <p>The questioning, and questionable, status of such versions and structures of reality raises the issue of how <em class="notranslate" translate="no">items</em> (such as objects, people, events) produced in them retain any status of the real and realism. Of course most often they do not, and this is precisely how cultures distinguish between a murder in a film and a murder that takes place in real life. At one level this quasijudgemental status is apparent, and the demarcations, whilst slippery, are recognisable most of the time. It is part of how the spectator comes to take up certain viewing positions or at least pretends to (the hypocrisis). However, part of this whole process involves deliberating on the relational contexts between reality (its effects and models) and simulacra. One of the key theorists in recent times on the simulacra is Baudrillard and it is worth recalling some of his points on this.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a6"><a href="#fn:a6">6</a></sup></p>
        <p>For Baudrillard the production of signs in postmodernity (and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the art form born in postmodernist times) involves signs that are more real than the real - these are the hyper-real which produce, or are produced out of, 'anesthetic hallucination of reality' (Baudrillard 1983: 142). Baudrillard, like Lyotard, argues that the production of signs more real than the real constitutes an essential part of the production and analysis of postmodernism. In doing so they come to question the relationship between signs and what they refer to (in much the same way as we observed above with Barthes's notion of the reality effect). This is related to a complex interplay <em class="notranslate" translate="no">between</em> reality, simulation and representation: 'The hyperreal transcends representation only because it is entirely in simulation' (Baudrillard 1983: 142). This is precisely what we find in cinema's relationship to reality, and its production of the effects of realism. The cinematic sign is more real than anything we find in the world, and in this quality we discover a shift in the fundamental relationship of signs to what they represent.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a7"><a href="#fn:a7">7</a></sup></p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Disruptive <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dispositif</em></h3>
        <p>We have already encountered the term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositij</em>, but its operation will be considered in a slightly different manner here. Film's capacity to disrupt social orders is premised on its position within the social orders themselves. In other words, film disrupts because of its presence as part of the social orders of its creation and reception, as well as its capacity to influence the formation of the spectating subject. It is where these elements of the different social orders, the formation of the subject, and the formation of a spectating subject, meet that forms the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositij</em>. This, in turn, provides the force for the disruption. We have already noted the three key aspects to this (the fundamental aspect of film as a social process; the capacity of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to disrupt through forms such as the carnivalesque; the relationship of film to different structures of reality). For this last section we shall be concerned not with attempting to bring these elements together, but to note some of the possibilities of their interactions and, in doing so, acknowledge the open-endedness of such operations.</p>
        <p>Lyotard's use of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif</em> emphasises the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">positif</em> aspects - it is the investment and cathexis of processes which lead to a positivity. In this way we witness a similarity - a contiguity is perhaps more correct - with the manner in which Kristeva posits the operation of the carnivalesque and its rupture of the thetic as a creative and enriching experience. A point - and it is a significant one - where such a comparison runs into problems is that much of the carnivalesque is socially disturbing, and this quality in itself is not inherently positive (no matter how broad such a description is in the sense of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif)</em>. What all this suggests is that we need to look at those filmic moments where the social disruption has positivity, so that there is a recognition of a disruptive <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif</em>. One way of doing this is to trace some of the points Kristeva makes regarding Menippean discourse,8 considering how these might be applied to the cinema.</p>
        <p>To summarise Kristeva's interpretation, Menippean discourse has the following qualities:</p>
        <p>1. Both comic and tragic, serious and camivalesque</p>
        <p>2. Politically and socially disturbing</p>
        <p>3. Highly inventive in its philosophical and imaginative constructions</p>
        <p>4. Freedom in its use of language, partly because it operates outside of the mainstream language structures</p>
        <p>5. Elements of the fantastic, often combined with 'macabre naturalism' 6. 'Adventures unfolded in brothels, robbers' dens, taverns, fairgrounds, and prisons, among erotic orgies and during sacred worship'</p>
        <p>7. Lack of distinction between virtues and vices</p>
        <p>8. Use of madness, dreams, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">doppelgangers</em></p>
        <p>9. Eccentricism in language</p>
        <p>10. Strong use of contrasts, and sudden changes and transitions</p>
        <p>11. A fascination with the double</p>
        <p>12. An exteriorisation of 'political and ideological conflicts of the moment'</p>
        <p>13. It emphasises the spectacle</p>
        <p>14. It resists logical sequences and structures</p>
        <p>(see Kristeva 1984a: 82-5)</p>
        <p>As with all such listings, it would be impossible to find any one text that fulfils all its elements (although any text must have a number of the qualities to be recognisable as Menippean); similarly the fluidity of some of the elements makes them impossible as precise reference points. However it is worth pursuing the idea of a Menippean cinema, for in such a form rests the possibility of a disruptive <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositij</em>. The brief comments and film references below are indicators of the richness of such a film form, and demonstrate how certain directors' works recur within this field.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a9"><a href="#fn:a9">9</a></sup> (Some of the points have been conflated below more as a point of economy, rather than implying they are the same.)</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">1. Both comic and tragic</em></h3>
        <p>To make this different from other variations of this combination, the tragicomedy for example, we need to <em>note</em> that in a Menippean <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> the two axes resist opposition and become fused so that sometimes it is difficult to tell one apart from the other. This means that rather than the tragic and the comic seeming to be separated by a thin line, or that they are opposites to one another, in Menippean <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> one can actually replace the other in its functions. Films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood Simple, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Reservoir Dogs</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> do this by creating a world order where the use of graphic violence forces the spectator into the difficult position of simultaneous anguish at the violence and perverse laughter at its excess. It could be argued that the laughter that takes place during and after such scenes, in, for example, the accidental death of the adolescent in the back of the car in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em>, and in the torture of the policeman in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reservoir Dogs</em>, and in the hunting of Abby by the private detective in the final scenes of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood Simple</em>, are all cases of an emotional release caused by the tension of the scene. What should make us resist this reading as the sole cause of such laughter (for it is almost certain that it does form part of the reason) is, firstly, that each of these scenes is mirrored by other scenes of violence and the comic, so that these are part of a larger order of diegetic organisation. This in turn gives the sequences not a shock value (found, for example, in the shower scene of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho)</em>, but a sense of a continuum of such events. This continuum (an unending stretching forth of the conflation of the comic and tragic, especially in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> which presents the narrative in a cyclic effect) is related to the second point, which is that the images in themselves do not mean anything. That is, they provide evidence of the casual nature of violence in these worlds, which has the effect of removing tragedy from violence. The way it is reinserted is through the signifiers of the innocence of the victims. The excess of the violence gives these victims the status of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pharmakos</em>, whose punishment is greater than any possible guilt. But even this is undercut by the lack ofremorse. The difference in the final scenes of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood Simple</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blade Runner</em> serves as an example of this. Both are stylistically very similar, with the darkness filling the screen, an almost homage to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> techniques, and the pursuit taking on excessive proportions. The main difference is how death is treated; the sheriff laughs and jokes at the irony of mistaken identity as he dies, but Roy Batty in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blade Runner</em> philosophises about the same ironies of identity and loss.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">2. Politically and socially disturbing; an exteriorisation of 'political and ideological coriflicts of the moment'</em></h3>
        <p>The idea that these films have a capacity to disturb the social and/or political orders is in one way demonstrated in their reception. This is not simply a case of looking for films that have incited riots or caused social upheaval. The idea of disturbance is more subtle, often imperceptible at the time. It can be of a wide social consequence (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Salo</em> for example), or it can have an impact on a small group or even the individual spectator. However, what distinguishes the Menippean/carnivalesque <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> from films with a social agenda is a lack of social responsibility. Examples of the first type, where films explore particular social and political issues, would include Eisenstein's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Battleship Potemkin</em> (1925) which has specific Stateled agendas, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naked</em> with its attack on Thatcherite politics and alienation, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Beautiful Laundrette</em>, which explores both interracial relationships and gay sexuality, and Troche's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Go Fish</em> (1994) which examines lesbian relationships and their social contexts. These agendas set such films apart from the Menippean, which may share those same sorts of interests and disruptions, but do not always have a uniform or clearly delineated position. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Belle de ]our</em> cannot be read as a film about the repression of sexuality and childhood trauma (in the most Freudian of senses), because it undercuts its own perspective on these. Severine/Belle explore the power of sexuality without resolution (as both the opening and closing scenes demonstrate). As Kristeva puts it: 'the Menippean experience is not cathartic; it is a festival of cruelty, but also a political act' (Kristeva 1984a: 84). Similarly, Bufiuel's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Discreet Charms of the Bourgeoisie</em> (1972) shifts the ironic mode too often for it to be a film simply about the excesses and immorality of the middle class.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">3. Highly inventive in its philosophical and imaginative constructions</em></h3>
        <p>Many of the films already referred to demonstrate these qualities, integrating different ideas and systems of thought into their narrative structure and themes. This can also be seen when film explores its own attributes; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane</em> is as much, if not more, about the investigation of cinema's philosophy and imagination as it is the story of a newspaper owner. Cinema's capacity to bewilder is also the quality that allows it to be inventive in these terms. The inventiveness of a shot or composition, which may make it appear 'meaningless' can be what it means; this in turn becomes part of the cinematic philosophy. The image of the two heads of the prisoners as they emerge, screaming, out of the rain-soaked ground in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raising Arizona</em> (Coen Bros. 1987) means little (their escape will be established), yet its inventiveness carries with it a sense of how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> can disrupt itself and its own narrative processes.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">4. Freedom in its use of language, partly because it operates outside of the mainstream language structures</em></h3>
        <p>Here we need to interpret this in terms of film language (as distinct from Kristeva's sense, which is more directed at the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parole</em>) and one such example would be film's language of temporality. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em>, with its disregard of the temporal organisation usually found in Hollywood cinema, demonstrates such freedom. Another example, far less complex in its use of temporal structuring, is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Devil's Advocate</em> (Hackford 1997). Almost the entire film works outside of the narrating frame's temporal order as the lawyer Kevin Lomax glances into the mirror, but this is not revealed until the final scenes. There is a hint of this given in his shudder, but this is not explained when it first takes place. The split second of the shudder takes up the entire journey to New York, madness and death, and it is in that moment that the festival of cruelty takes place. Here, time is used to restructure the film, as well as feed in to the idea of temptation, second chances, and human weakness.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">5. Elements of the fantastic, often combined with 'macabre naturalism'</em></h3>
        <p>Certain cinematic forms immediately leap to mind in terms of such qualities, including surrealism (such as Cocteau's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood of a Poet</em> (1930) and all of Bunuel's works) and expressionism <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Cabinet of Dr Caligari</em> and, later, Fassbinder's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant</em> (1972) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Herzog'sEvenDwaifs Started Small</em> (1970) demonstrate in different ways such combinations). Similarly, some directors have a style which makes use of the fantastic and this macabre naturalism, often to provide social and political commentary. The films of both Almodovar and Bigas Lunas demonstrate these elements located within excesses of sexuality and corporeality. The characters are obsessive about the body and its sexual functions, often to the point of being antisocial (and so fulfilling that other quality of the socially disturbing) with little or no regard for the cultural conventions. Almodovar's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Live Flesh</em> (1998) produce their macabre qualities from the violence of love; Lunas's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tit and the Moon (Tetay la Luna)</em> (1994) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Golden Balls (Hueros de Oro)</em> (1993) utilise the fantastic wanderings of the male protagonist to examine the obsessions and excesses of masculine desires, especially in terms of the body.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">6. 'Adventures unfolded in brothels, robbers' dens, taverns, fairgrounds, and prisons, among erotic orgies and during sacred worship'</em></h3>
        <p>These settings were used in original Menippean literatures to present the fringes of 'normal' society; they were the liminal zones that edged and undercut the pretences of the orderly and harmonious in culture. As discussed above, the liminal spaces are often used to parody the operations of the social, warping the moral and ethical structures so they are still recognisable, yet estranged. Many of these spaces, subsequently, have become a form of shorthand for these qualities, and film will utilise the connotations of the space to establish a break from the normal social order. It is the intrusion of these spaces into the social order which presents a more carnivalesque usage, rather than the protagonists visiting these areas. Many of Jacques Tourneur's films have this quality of the intervention of the carnivalesque, often presented metaphorically as part of the supernatural, including <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cat People</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Walked With a Zombie</em> (1943), which locate the macabre in the everyday. In a different way, his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Out of the Past</em> (1947) has the intervention of a carnivalesque (prisons and crime) as it emerges from a repressed past. A film that plays with this whole structure of disintegrating divisions between the real and the fantastic is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Celine and Julie Going Boating</em>. The two women take it in turns to visit the strange house until they understand the narrative within that world order. They then rescue the small girl held captive, but in doing so allow the fantastic world to intrude into their everyday existence in Paris when the characters follow them. There are other examples which illustrate these sorts of liminal social zones, where violence, madness and unrestrained sexuality are part of the order: Ken Russell's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Devils</em> (1971), with its theme of religious mania, is an example of a combination of the orgiastic and sacred worship; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Belle de ]our</em> mixes the setting of the brothel with Belle's unconscious so that they become synchronous states; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cabinet of Dr Caligari</em> utilises the fairground atmosphere to confuse madness with the carnival; the series of women in prison (for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Caged Heat</em> (Demme 1974)) use the interplay of socially constructed sites of perverted law to represent transgressions of violence and sexuality.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">7. Lack of distinction between virtues and vices</em></h3>
        <p>The problematising of ethics and morality is a key function of the Menippean form, forit offers very few (ifany) solutions to these dilemmas, producing them instead. Part of this use in the films is premised on the blurring of virtue and vice. Sometimes this is played out openly, with the social conventions declared, such as is found injancs6's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Public Virtues, Private Vices</em> (1976), but in such an example the lack is actually not derived from a cultural irony or hypocrisy, but from the diegetic lack of moral distinctions. Pasolini's <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> often holds this very quality up for careful scrutiny, avoiding a moralising position, and allowing the images themselves to problematise the culturally established differences between the acceptable and the forbidden. One of the best examples of this is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Theorem</em> (1968) which uses sexual desire as a metaphor for class structure and morality. This is part of the strength of this form of cinema; for rather than moralise, it proposes ideological positions that constantly question those very processes of moralising. This whole issue is also significant in terms of Lacan's ideas on the relationship between the Real and morality.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a10"><a href="#fn:a10">10</a></sup></p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">8. Use of madness, dreams</em>, doppelgangers; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">a fascination with the double</em></h3>
        <p>Many of the films already cited so far contain attributes such as madness and dreams. Sometimes these are foregrounded (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</em> emphasising madness, the dream-like qualities ofTourneur's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cat People</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Twelve Monkeys</em>, which contains both) so that the status itself is used as an organising principle of the film's narrative. At other times these aspects are presented without mediation or explanation. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">City of Lost Children</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Delicatessen U</em> eunet and Caro 1991) offer nothing by way of explaining the strangeness of the worlds we witness. The use of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">doppelgangers</em>, as with many other of these devices, varies in its sense of the carnivalesque. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Double Life of Vironique</em> (Kieslowski 1991) is much less Menippean in its use of the double, as is Fellini's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Toby Dammit</em> (in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Histoires Extraordinaires</em> 1967). For whereas the first of these has a languid, almost accidental double, the protagonist in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Toby Dammit</em> is tortured and, eventually, driven to madness and death by his double. Veronique's double exists in a sense of the possibility of alternate lives (in a similar way to Helen Quilley in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sliding Doors</em> (Hewitt 1998)); but Toby Dammit is never given the possibility of escape.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">9. Strong use of contrasts, and sudden changes and transitions</em></h3>
        <p>These aspects can take place at both the level of content/style and theme, and it is not uncommon to find both taking place in the same film. It is important to remember that part of the Menippean form (and hence a carnivalesque operation) is a resistance to clear-cut distinctions (as in, for example, moral and ethical acts). As such, the sharp contrasts made often operate within the created world order's own perspective. After all, it could be argued that Ethan in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em> (Ford 1956) demonstrates these characteristics, but we would be reluctant to describe this as carnivalesque, except within a strict generic sense of a disruption of the Western codes. For this attribute to function within a carnivalesque capacity, the contrasts and transitions must work within a form that already resists many of the expected qualities of film. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Un Chien andalou</em> does this, drawing surrealism's desires for the shocking and instability; another of Bufiuel's films which illustrates this is the final scene of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Simon of the Desert</em> with its abrupt change to mid-1960s images of modernity. A more subtle example is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Badlands</em>, which at first sight might seem far from carnivalesque. However, one of the ways in which this film utilises contrasts is between the narrating voice of Holly and the actions seen on the screen. The almost matter-of-fact, flatly delivered explanations of why and how certain events took place, are often completely undermined by the shown actions of Kit. Far more than an unreliable narrator, this voice works against the image (and vice versa) so that what is posed are a number of different narratives, each as plausible as the others, operating within different temporal zones as the story switches from the action taking place to what has supposedly happened, and what might have happened.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">10. An emphasis on the spectacle</em></h3>
        <p>Cinema, by its very nature, is spectacle, but the nature of that visual effect and composition is far from homogeneous. So <em>we</em> must distinguish between the different senses of the spectacle in order to indicate what it might look like in the carnivalesque. For example, there are differences in the sort of spectacle of excess found in a Cecil B. de Mille production, the spectacle of special effects found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Armageddon</em> (Bay 1998), and the baroque details in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover</em> or the chiaroscuro visuals in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Prospero's Books</em> (1991). Of these perhaps the last examples from Greenaway best represent the carnivalesque usage, although it could be argued that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ten Commandments</em> (de Mille 1923; 1956) has a dimension of the carnivalesque in terms of its excess; and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Armageddon</em> (like other films based on powerful visual effects) pushes, to excess, the whole use of special effects by its dependency on them. However, in Greenaway's films (and this is the case for most, if not all, of them) the spectacle becomes emphasised in a different way, for it can run counter to the narrative processes (that is, visuals appear with little or no direct correlation to what is happening in the narrative itself). The visuals can also consume the narrative, making what is seen far more important that what is understood by them. Often the spectacle in Greenaway is just that, and any sense of diegetic depth is resisted as it passes quickly out of view. It is this quality of the emphasis, rather than just the spectacle, that can give the images a carnivalesque quality.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">11. The resistance to logical sequences and structures</em></h3>
        <p>This aspect follows on from the idea of the spectacle, for one of the ways <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> best resists logical structures is through the image. The constructs of montage and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> are used to develop logical sequences, and to structure images; yet it is precisely this attribute that makes them equally effective in resisting such procedures. This is well demonstrated in a film like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Un Chien andalou</em>, but there is something equally carnivalesque in the tightly constructed montage of the shower scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho</em>. As with visual excess (and the spectacle) this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</em> sets up a resistance to logical sequences, even though the sequence itselfis highly structured. This happens because of the tightness of the structure, rather than because of it. In short, Hitchcock deconstructs the montage effect by taking it further than is usually found. In other examples of this type we might wish to designate a carnivalesque quality to those moments where the resistance is used but not explained (as would be the case in flashbacks, or the epiphany of Kevin in the mirror at the beginning of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Devil's Advocate)</em>.</p>
        <p>A different sort of example to this idea of resistance is Lynch's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lost Highway</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wild at Heart</em>. Both films contain many attributes of the carnivalesque listed above, and it is fairly straightforward to see how they resist logical sequences (particularly <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lost Highway)</em>. However, a different way of considering this would be the generic link which both films establish and then break. The road movies of Hollywood in the 1970s tied their narrative structures quite literally to the road. In a linear metaphor the journey of the protagonist (almost inevitably male until <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Thelma and Louise</em> (Scott 1991)) starts in the city and ends somewhere on the road, often in the hands of authority (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vanishing Point</em> (Sarafian 1971)) or opposing ideologies (as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Easy Rider)</em>. Even the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mad Max</em> trilogy, which in the first film resisted closure, works towards an end to the road. This film form has a strong, logical sequence to the narrative overall, and it is this convention that the anti-road movie <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lost Highway</em> resists.</p>
        <p>From this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sense</em> that film can both establish its discourses and undermine them, sometimes at the same time, <em>we</em> move towards a consideration of meaning structures and cinema. This will, inevitably, involve a similar division - a construction of devices which attempt to establish meaning, and an undercutting of them by other processes and cinematic invention. It is to these points that <em>we</em> must turn our attention.</p>

        <ol>
            <li id="fn:a1">The terms 'ontologies' and 'ontological orders' are used in the phenomenological sense here: that is, the formation of'realities', such as a textual ontology where events, identities, subject positions, histories, etc. have a specific currency and legitimacy within that order, but (potentially) lack this in another ontology (such as the wider social order).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>

            <li id="fn:a3">In this context it is well to recall Kristeva's point that parody is not part of the carnivalesque. As she points out: 'The word "carnivalesque" lends itself to an ambiguity one must avoid. In contemporary society, it generally connotes parody, hence a strengthening of the law. There is a tendency to blot out the carnival's <em>dramatic</em> (murderous, cynical, and revolutionary in the sense of <em>dialtctical transformation)</em> aspects' {Kristeva 1984a: 80). This must certainly also hold true for carnivalesque cinema.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a3">↩</a></li>

            <li id="fn:a5">As with all these orders of reality, this is a complex issue. To witness how someone like Freud dealt with such a notion the reader is referred to his essay 'The Loss of Reality in Neurosis and Psychosis' (1984).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a5">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a6">Of course the whole history of the theories ofsimulacra reaches back at least as far as Plato's model of the cave; and it is this history that Baudrillard is a part of. In a different way Baudry (1986) makes use of this history to analyse cinema's relationship to the outside world.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a6">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a7">It is through this line of argument that Lyotard is able to assert that 'everything is a sign or mark, but that nothing is marked or signified, in that in this sense, signs are signs of nothing, not in the sense that they refer to a zero which would be what causes them to signify' (Lyotard 1993: 69). Lyotard argues that each sign sets up a complex network of references to other signs. So it is not that there is nothing, but that there is no singularity to the sign, and hence the sign's relationship to reality is one of plurality.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a7">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a8">Kristeva defines this discourse as originating from those texts which have a lineage back to Menippus ofGadara, a third-century philosopher and satirist, but which historically extends further back.

            <li id="fn:a9">Many of the film examples given below contain a number of the attributes; however, rather than limit the examples to a few, the following show the qualities of the Menippean across a wide range.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a9">↩</a></li>
