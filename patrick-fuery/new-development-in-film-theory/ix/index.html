        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Film and Meaning</h2>
        <p>There are many ways in which we might approach the idea of meaning in film. However the main concern here is not what films mean, but how they come to be seen as meaningful, how there is a generation of signs which take on the appearance of sense and hermeneutic value, how our perception of them is arrested so that we feel, as spectators, that meaning is to be found, or needs to be worked at. To this end, the chapter is divided into three parts: the first section will be concerned with mapping out a particular approach to how meaning appears in films; the second section will take up this issue from two different perspectives, shifting away from the point of the film's reception, to issues concerned with the cultural production of meaning; the final section will take up some points from Derrida, examining how meaning 'frames' are generated in order to make interpretative gestures. Each of these positions is used to illustrate the volatility of meaning, and how ultimately we need to look to the mechanisms which declare something to be meaningful in order to understand the relationship of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to meaning. The following chapter will consider in more detail the challenge to, and even collapse of, such relationships.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Towards a Phenomenology of Cinema</h3>
        <p>Of all the theories of meaning and interpretation which have developed in recent times, such as semiotics, psychoanalysis, feminism, cultural theory, and deconstruction, the place of phenomenology has been the least explored. As a movement its importance is perhaps not as clearly stated because it has operated as a backdrop to some of the other, more highlighted, theories. Certainly the psychoanalysis of Lacan, the semiotics of Barthes, the feminist psychoanalysis of Kristeva, and Derrida's deconstructionalist methods all share some sort of relationship with phenomenology (be it supportive or, at times, antagonistic). Some of these points have already been considered in the course of this book, but in order to work through the idea that phenomenology might provide a model for considering how meanings operate in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, we shall consider some fundamental ideas from the works of Husserl, Ingarden, and Iser in terms of the film texts.</p>
        <p>The first general point that we observe in such an approach is the emphasis on the act of reading. Phenomenology is concerned with how the subject produces understanding (that is, interpretative gestures) about the world around himself/herself, and the relationships which determine, and are determined, by this. In terms of the text, a phenomenological approach considers how the act of reading/looking is part of these processes, and participates in the construction of the relationships. Phenomenology distinguishes what it calls the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lebenswelt</em> (life-world), or the world of everyday existence, from other realms, such as the textual and psychical. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lebenswelt</em> determines, and is determined by, the 'natural attitude', and part of phenomenology's task, according to Husserl, is to allow us to work beyond that position to investigate the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> (the fundamental essence) of the object, event, sensation, etc. The methods by which we can arrive at this perspective (for in phenomenology it is much more about the positioning of the subject rather than some sort of Platonic ideal) are detailed and complex, and would lead us too far from our main concerns. However a few selected concepts will illustrate what a phenomenological approach looks like, and also allow us to explore it in terms of film and meaning.</p>
        <p>To arrive at the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of the phenomenon, phenomenology argues we need to bracket off the object of investigation, to take it out of the natural attitude and strip it to its core. This is eidetic reduction, and fundamental to it is the idea that the act of consciousness is composed of two parts, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noesis</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noema</em>. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noesis</em> is the act of consciousness itself, and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noema</em> is the object to which that consciousness is directed. The other significant part to this is that consciousness must <em>be</em> seen as being intentional, of having a direction. When we are conscious, we are conscious of <em>something</em> (we think something, we dream something, we feel something). The act of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noesis</em> is always directed towards some object, thought, event, etc. Phenomenology, largely via Husserl, describes at length the sorts of mechanisms and processes involved in performing this type of analysis, moving from the subject's position in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lebenswelt</em>, through this idea of phenomenological suspension (the bracketing or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">epoche</em>), through eidetic reduction, to a point where the relationship between <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noesis</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noema</em> is seen as part of a specific relationship between subject and object. This is what is called the transcendental egological state, or the focus on what consciousness itself is. This provides us with the first set of ideas about phenomenology and film.</p>
        <p>Essentially we can approach the analysis of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> through phenomenology in two ways. First, phenomenology can be used to examine <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself, its <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cinemaness</em>, or that which makes <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, cinema.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup> The other approach would be to consider <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as a form of phenomenological investigation - that is, that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself provides us with a type of eidetic reduction; that watching a film allows the spectator to observe the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of a subjective or cultural phenomenon, such as love, horror, history, or care. As our primary concern here is to examine the idea of meaning-producing systems, we shall focus on the second of these, commenting whenever possible on the first. And to keep the discussion focused, a specific example will be considered, that of revenge. Before doing so we require one further note on the idea of meaning (from a phenomenological perspective) itself. Ruthrof ( 1992), in his study of the relationships between language and meaning, suggests three sources to explain the occurrence of slippage (or, as he puts it, fuzziness) in meaning. These are <em class="notranslate" translate="no">propositional opacity, modal opacity</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotic opacity</em>. The first of these is 'a semantic opaqueness inherent in the way in which the meanings of words and their combinations in expressions and sentences are circumscribed'; the second is 'the opaqueness introduced into language through enunciation' (Ruthrof 1992: 28); and the third is the slippage through the meeting of different sign systems and the socio-cultural surroundings in which <em>we</em> encounter the text (Ruthrof 1992: 75). Furthermore, Ruthrof allows for the intervention of these opacities in texts through the reader actively constructing speech situations. Although his interests are with the literary text and the spoken word, Ruthrof's ideas on opacity and meaning can be usefully employed in the study of relationships between the film text and the spectator. We find the same phenomena of opaqueness present in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> through a combination of processes, including the missing parts of the image and narrative (see below), the activity of the gaze from the spectator, his/her cultural contexts, and the gaze emerging from the screen itself. Propositional opacity in film includes the formation of meanings and slippage through its constitutive elements (camera angles, lighting, sound, sharpness of image, etc); modal opacity is formulated in the meeting of the gaze in everyday life with the gaze we adopt to watch films. Physiologically the same (except perhaps in levels of intensity), these gazes operate in vastly different terms of determining meaning and producing opacity in them. And semiotic opacity is the variation we encounter between the differing cultural contexts of the created world order of the film, the spectator's cultural context, the culture of the critical environment, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">etc</em>.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The</em> Eidos <em class="notranslate" translate="no">of Revenge</em></h3>
        <p>Our concern here must not simply be the cataloguing of films which feature revenge as an integral part of their narrative. For this would lead us closer to a generic formation rather than developing the idea that film can be interpreted as devising a type of eidetic reduction. Herein lies the double agenda of meaning in this context: that by examining film in a certain way we produce a type of interpretation about a cultural (or textual) <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noema;</em> and that this whole process is in itself a system of interpretation, for it can be seen to reflect cinema's relationship to the production of meaning(s). These two hermeneutic functions are not necessarily compatible, it must be stated, for one suggests film's use as an interpretative 'tool', whilst the other makes demands which require us to distinguish how such knowledges are produced. This means that if we are to consider how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> might allow an eidetic reduction of revenge, so that <em>we come</em> to understand what revenge is in both a cinematic and wider cultural context, then the caveat must be that any knowledge produced from this already has a frame surrounding it. What we may arrive at is much less an understanding of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of revenge, and more a semiotic sense of its cinematic operations. This signals the impossibility of a phenomenological reduction, without at least some acknowledgement of the interpretative frames themselves, and the problems of attempting to arrive at essences. This is precisely the issue to be taken up in the following sections of this chapter.</p>
        <p>To refine the example here we shall borrow from Klein's notions of the good object and bad object (Klein 1988), where she determines that the inter/intrapsychic relationship between a subject and various objects shifts from the totally positive to the totally negative (Klein's example being the breast for the child is good ifit is given, bad ifit is withheld). Revenge in most films is represented as mostly good or bad, with the occasional taint of the other. Revenge comes at a cost to those who enact it, no matter how 'pure' the motivations seem. Part of this is the delineation of revenge as a specific phenomenon, as distinct from, say, murder, theft, obsession, the immoral. This is its <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> compared to other, similar emotions and actions, for it is, comparatively, what makes revenge revenge and not any of these others.</p>
        <p>In <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> there are, invariably, three parts to revenge: the causal sequences, the acting out, the revelation. The first of these refers to that sequence of events which justifies the revenge if it is seen as part of the good object, or makes it seem perverse if it is the bad object. It is in this element of causality that the overt ideological properties of the actions are often embedded. The long production of Vietnam war films (particularly in cases such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rambo</em> (Cosmatos 1982) and its sequels) contains many examples of the causality of revenge being ideologically driven, which in turn is supposed to justify the actions. In this sense Hollywood in the 1970s and 1980s produced many examples of revenge films, all premised on a causality to give the acts of revenge a sense of the good object. Three of the main motives often found in such films of this period were patriotism (with films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rambo</em>), rape (for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lipstick</em> (Johnson 1976), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Angel</em> (O'Neill 1984) <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Straw Dogs</em> (Peckinpah 1971), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Deliverance</em> (Boorman 1972), and from a quite different perspective <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fatal Attraction</em> (Lyne 1987)), and urban crime and the individual policeman's (forit was almost always a man) fight against it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Dirty Harry</em> (Siegal 1971)). The popularity of such films ensured sequels, but in itself this ongoing process of the return to revenge suggests that the act is something that is part of a continuous cycle. This quality constitutes part of the eidetic structure of revenge - it is not resolvable, even if death has been delivered. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightmare on Elm Street</em> films (along with a great many other slasher films premised on revenge) utilised the supernatural to continue the cycle of vengeance; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rambo</em>, and other war films of this type, utilise the need to rewrite history; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Deliverance</em>, which lacks the supernatural or cultural histories, closes with a nightmare of the body breaking the surface of the water. In this case the act of revenge has become part of the unconscious.</p>
        <p>In such scenarios of the good object(ive) of revenge, the causal events must always be extreme (often in terms of violence and violation), unjust, and highly personalised, with an ineffectual response from the social order (such as the legal system). This allows the events to become focused on an individual, who comes to stand, in a synecdoche fashion, for all types of revenge. In this sense we witness another part of the eidos of revenge, particularly in terms of Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> - it reflects the individuation of a subject through the ineffectual mechanisms of law and social order. Without this textuallegitimation the acts of revenge would be seen as antisocial and anarchic; but with it the opposite is posited. In such films there is little, if any, sense of a conflict in these terms. The good object(ive) of revenge is marked by triumph, even ifthe cost (socially or subjectively in terms of the scarring of the self) is acknowledged. This scarring is also part of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of revenge, for it marks the necessity of all actions, bears witness to the causal events, distinguishes the agent of vengeance from others in the social order, and serves as a reminder, in the cyclic process, of such actions and causes.</p>
        <p>Compare the causality of revenge in other types of films and it becomes evident that such a quality of the investment in the individual through the good object of revenge is not always consistent. Coppola's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Godfather</em> trilogy stands out as a reminder of the darkness of revenge as a corrupting process, and as such all revenge becomes the bad object, no matter what the motive. All the participants in the acts of violence (including the women) acknowledge the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">coda</em> of the vendetta, and incorporate these aspects <em>we</em> have considered so far - the cyclic process, the individuation, and the scarring. Sonny and Michael are positioned as different, oppositional poles on the axis of revenge; one blinded by the need for retribution, and made violent in a desire for it; the other calmer and made somehow less human by the calculations of revenge. Yet both observe, in their different ways, the same procedures, rendering it a combination of the good and the bad. Revenge in Scorsese's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Taxi Driver</em> ( 1976) functions in an ironic and oppositional mode to the celebratory good objects of vengeance. It demonstrates a social order just as incapable as Travis Bickle of distinguishing the violence of madness from the acts of a Rambo or Harry Callahan. Part of this is attributable to the Catholicism of Scorsese's films, for the scarring of these characters is a spiritual one, often tied to guilt.</p>
        <p>The bad object(ive) of revenge carries these same eidetic qualities, but such acts are seen as antisocial precisely because they are driven by these qualities. An individual's desire for revenge against a specific person, as well as the law, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon</em> threatens the entire social order, and the Marshall's thwarting of it does not in itselfrescue that order (which is akin to a scarring of the social order). In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Die Hard3it</em> is the desire to avenge a brother's death that motivates the terrorist acts, so combining the issues of the individual against the social order (through terrorism), and the cycle of those acts. The highly symbolic revenge meted out by Stewart on Ada in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Piano</em> (Campion 1993) with the cutting off of her finger illustrates how the act of revenge can be more excessive than that which caused it, and the scarring operates within the domain of sacrifice and exchange.</p>
        <p>The second part of the sequence is the acting out of the revenge. Because of what has gone before, there is usually no need to justify the excesses of the actions of the person exacting vengeance for the good object(ive). Whilst in the bad object(ive) of revenge the more extreme the acts the stronger the sense of the antisocial and pathological. This brings us to another eidetic point of revenge. The desire for revenge is premised on obsession and consumes all its participants, both good and bad. It is a destabilising process and all reason is forgone in the efforts to gain what is desired. This is part of the cyclic flow of these acts, for each action elicits a secondary order of revenge. When Will Kane throws his badge to the ground at the end of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon</em> he is acting out his own revenge against the townspeople's apathy and inaction. The irony here of course is that Frank Miller's revenge on the town fails at one level, but succeeds in the flow-on effect of social breakdown. Ethan, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em>, is driven to the point of madness by the need/desire for revenge; yet even when it is supposedly satiated, the sense of cycle continues as the closing shot mirrors the opening one. Similarly Ada does enact revenge against her husband's violent punishment, at first by leaving him, then in choosing life. These examples illustrate how revenge can operate symbolically, as forming part of a conscious agent, as well as unconsciously. This is an idea that Freud utilises in his attempts to explain the final acts of Dora in his case study. Unconscious revenge is no less motivated than those acts which are carefully and consciously defined.</p>
        <p>The final scene of Ada playing the piano, a metal finger tapping against a key, like the final scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon</em> (a metal badge against the soil) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em> (the lonely figure of Ethan wandering into the vast expanse of land), represents the unresolvable nature of revenge. It is part of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of revenge that it must take place at the end of the narrative, for it is a force which diegetically drives the characters, and is at its most powerful when its resolution is absent and seemingly impossible. But in this non-closure is located the sense of the cycle, because the protagonist who commences any act of revenge is invariably altered by his/her actions, and this in turn alters their social position and the meanings surrounding all activities. The implication (which is of an eidetic nature) must be that no action motivated by revenge can produce quietus.</p>
        <p>The third part of revenge is related to this sense of non-closure, for it is the moment of realisation. Revenge works most sweetly for its enactors in this revelatory moment. Often the whole narrative sequence is based on the lack of knowledge by one party, and the power of this knowledge by the other. The moment of epiphany acts as the closest thing to resolution in the revenge cycle, for it is here that power is asserted, and satisfaction gained. Cinema often draws on this moment, utilising the closeup to mark the point of realisation. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mad Max</em> all of the events which portray Max's revenge for the death of his wife, child and work partner, are prefaced with him letting the bike gang members know who is killing them, and why. Each death he causes produces no satisfaction in itself, it is only the moment beforehand - this moment of revelatory power - which carries with it any sense of gaining resolution. Even so, Max is condemned to a form of madness, and endless wanderings, because he becomes involved in these acts. Similarly, Ethan in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Searchers</em> performs vengeance by returning the daughter into the home (with more impact than any of the more overt acts, such as scalping and shooting the dead Indians, which are devoid of any meaning to the white people). This is an ideological revenge, perhaps more insidious in its political dimensions than other demonstrations of revenge in the Western. William Munny in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ueforgiven</em>, like Max, is drawn into the cycle of revenge most reluctantly; and this is a reluctance derived from the knowledge that it never ends. What overrides this hesitancy is not simply the death of close friends and family, but the seduction of the revelatory power.</p>
        <p>We could continue with such examples, but let us return to the point which commenced this section. Do these points on the cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of revenge indicate a wider social <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> on the same subject? Such a complex question resists easy answers. At one level it could be argued that the social relationships of film to culture mean that the production of such texts invariably reflects a certain perspective on the structure, function, and processes of revenge. The almost limitless factors that come into play with such an assertion (where, for example, do we locate the forces of capitalism in the sense of individuation? of the twentieth century as a milieu with historically distinct attitudes towards revenge? and of the religious influences in a Christian culture on the sensibility of the cycle of vengeance?) make any specific resolutions impossible. What we can note, however, is that the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of revenge in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> marks cultural and historical perspectives, not in a homogeneous sense, but as a part of the hermeneutic act. This point returns us to the central issue at hand, that of cinema's relationship to meaning. However, before tackling this issue from a different perspective, some other concepts from phenomenology will enable us to consider other aspects of the construction of meaning.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Appresentation of Terror; the Lacunae of the Orgasm</h3>
        <p>Part of the emphasis that has developed out of phenomenology, via reception theory and, to a certain extent, the semiotics of Barthes and Eco, has been on the role of the reader/spectator. This shift from an emphasis on certain devices in the text, or the functions and constructions of the artist (in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> the director would seem the most appropriate figure), and even the cultural contexts, to the creative and active reader/spectator should not be seen as a negation of those other elements. Barthes's notions of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lisible</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scriptible</em>, which are so heavily invested with the processes of reading, rely, at some point, on the intervention of elements outside of the act of reading; but it is the emphasis which sets these sorts of approaches apart. One of the ways phenomenological strategies have dealt with the role and function of the reading agent is by examining the incomplete qualities of the text.</p>
        <p>Various phenomenological approaches (the works of lngarden and Iser are good examples) argue that the literary text is constituted not of completion, of solid and crafted descriptions, but of gaps and absences, the lacunae. The act of reading, within such terms, is pleasurable - desired even - because there is much to do in this filling in of the missing parts. This is also part of the opacity of meaning (Ruthrof 1992) - a quality which actually allows for slippage in meaning and creativity. Cinema presents unique issues in these terms because, at face value, there would seem to be little missing from the images and sounds on the screen. However, apart from the lacunae of narrative that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> shares with other narrative forms (such as the novel), there are also number of devices that have developed within film that actively promote and rely on these absences, as well as the opacity. We shall consider only one of these, that of appresentation, marking points where others are of relevance, within the specific representation of terror.</p>
        <p>Part of the phenomenological method deals with the process of how we continually perform acts of appresentation. The following is a simple illustration: when we look at an object - say a table - we do not see the complete form, and perhaps only three legs can be seen, or part of the top is obscured. We do not think that this is a three-legged table, but rather we appresent the missing parts. This is done through a number of processes, not the least (in this example anyway) being our knowledge of tables and table-like structures. The more 'complex' (a difficult concept in these terms) the object, the more we rely on further and more extensive paradigms of experience and knowledge to produce meaning. Cinema requires its spectators to function constantly within a mode of appresentation, at both the formal and content levels. Sometimes this has an almost entirely pragmatic function, where aspects of the narrative are appresented for the sake of economy. A character boards a train at a station, and is then seen disembarking after a series of shots of train wheels speeding along. The spectator has appresented (this time using the codes of montage and diegetic progression) that the character has taken a journey, and the need to extend images of that journey become redundant.</p>
        <p>There are more complex processes of appresentation, one being where the film actually forces a type of filling-in by the spectator, almost against his/her will or desire. This illustrates the idea of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">hypocrisis</em> or feigning (Ruthrof 1992: 166), which is the way in which (for our interests here) the spectator operates within and beyond the boundaries established in the reading/viewing position of the film. In other words, if <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, and each individual film, sets up certain positions in order to be watched (and this is more than simply perception of course), then the spectator adopts these and alters, resists, changes certain attributes of them. Ruthrof describes this as the feigning of the subject position in the act of reading, and it is a concept well-suited to understanding variants in the spectating event as well. Along with the continual evocations of feigned subject positions that the spectator necessarily takes up in order to watch the film, there is also the 'reader's awareness of the relationship between a statement [for our concerns the equivalent is the image] and its frame' (Ruthrof 1992: 166). Such combinations are created within the space determined by the gaze of the spectator co-joined with that of the film. The capacity for film to cause the appresentation of terror, which should run counter to any sense of pleasure, is a powerful device in the cinematic process. It is one of the ways in which we can understand the operation of hypocrisis in the spectator, and why pleasure and terror can be co-joined. And as a contrasting, but also complementary, idea we can consider how the representation of pleasure (in this case sexual) is also positioned as an absence requiring appresentation and a feigned subject position. Finally, we can consider how the two forms are utilised to create a composite set of appresentations that should work oppositionally, but are textually bound together.</p>
        <p>The most effective forms of terror are often those derived from the lacuna! qualities. It has been said many times over that the force of the imagination can conjure up far more terrifying images than can be actually shown; so the slow pan up from the torture scene of the policeman in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reservoir Dogs</em> forces us to appresent a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">terrorness</em> that could never be actually replicated on the screen. Such an idea of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">terrorness</em> (the eidetic quality of terror itself) only ever being possible through appresentation leads us to Kristeva's points on abjection and specular seduction. In her book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Powers of Horror</em>, Kristeva designates the unnamable terror - the abject drive - as part of the splitting of the subject, and of a recognition of the defiled body emerging out from the subject's own sense of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">corps propre</em> (Kristeva 1982). But a key part to this is the lacuna! threats to that body- it is the fear of the loss which gives so much power to the abject, producing what Kristeva calls the borderliner. Similarly, she opens her essay 'Ellipsis on Dread and the Specular Seduction' by marking the abject's relationship to the gaze as the absent self: 'What I see has nothing to do with the specular which fascinates me. The glance by which I identify an object, a face, my own, another's, delivers my identity which reassures me: for it delivers me <em class="notranslate" translate="no">fromfrayages</em>, nameless dread .. .' (Kristeva 1986: 236). This dread, which leads to so much terror - including the terror within the self, and the cultural construction of images of terror - is located within a struggle manifested in the gaze.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a2"><a href="#fn:a2">2</a></sup> For Kristeva it is the model of the hysteric that best illustrates this fear, for in this is the process of being 'endlessly unable to find a sufficiently satisfying mirror' (Kristeva 1986: 236), and so have no sense of reference for the self. As with Lacan's anecdote about his fishing trip with Petit-Jean (as discussed in Chapter 2), to not be recognised by the gaze of the Other induces a sense of a loss of the subject himself/herself.</p>
        <p>This more psychoanalytically motivated scene can be brought to bear on the idea of terror and appresentation. The terror of the hysteric's relationship of the image for the self, like the terror created on the screen, is premised on the lack devised out of the requirements of appresentation. The force comes from the inescapable nature of that very relationship which inserts the spectator into the image, reflecting themselves back to the self. What we fear in the appresentation of terror is two fold: that which can be created in our imagination, helped by the elements in the film; and our own relationship to the terror, created in the creative act of appresenting. If the image is complete, the abject made visible, there is still the possibility of resisting it, or of locating the self outside of it. However, any act of appresentation immediately traps the spectator into becoming part of the construction of the terror itself. To appresent terror is to locate the self as part of that creation, and it is this point that sets appresentation apart from the more straightforward idea that the absence of the representation is a textual construction, derived from conventions and textual practices.</p>
        <p>What then of the representation of the orgasm through a system of appresentation? Can the same sorts of relationships be said to exist? The social order's moral codes designate the explicit depiction of sexuality into rigorously policed categories. These codes clearly mark out (from culture to culture and across time) what can and cannot be represented, and what categories the representing of the sexual falls into (the acceptable in the public sphere against the pornographic, etc). Already from this straightforward, social (legal) perspective we witness elements of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lacunae</em>, for it is these gaps that allow <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> to suggest, imply, and momentarily disclose the repressed of the Symbolic order. There is a beyond to this, which locates the key elements within a different (although not necessarily unrelated) set of processes.</p>
        <p>Certain types of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lacunae</em> of the orgasm, like terror, often work through metonymy, and cinema's metonymic processes are an inherent part of its discourses. The cinematic metonym is most readily recognisable as an image implying a concept. For example, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho</em> the money that Marion steals operates metonymically for all of her social transgressions (sex outside of marriage, lying); yet it is also a metonym for irony (because she chooses to return the money but is still killed), and for the excesses of the punishment (her death is more brutal than any crime she commits). The camera pans out of the bathroom, after the attack by 'Mother', across the room, before halting for a considera hie period on the money wrapped in newspaper. This shot provides the metonymic link between the money, its representative values, and the consequences of them. In other words, the metonymic processes of the images are often polysemic, and so their diegetic function can be diverse. The more tightly controlled the representation of an image, the more devices such as the metonym are employed, which is certainly the case with the orgasm. Some of these images become located within a code system so that they operate as a form of established meaning. The closeup of a hand clenching a sheet, the head thrown back, closed eyes, all function as metonyms for the orgasm.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, however, there is another type of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lacunae</em> of the orgasm which functions in a different political frame. This is when the orgasm is not metonymically suggested, but where it is made absent for any number of reasons, including the political and the textual. Such lacunae are paradigmatically linked to other absences, such as homosexuality and interracial relationships. That they are not represented gives way to a social order where their existence seems to be an impossibility, the unthought, or the unrepresentable. Appresenting these becomes a much more politically framed act.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinematic Epistemes and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dispositif</em></h3>
        <p>Foucault's theories on the episteme will provide us with a good starting point to understanding further the relationship between film and meaning. By working towards the idea that there might be cinematic epistemes we can also consider some of the ways in which meaning functions cinematically (that is, in and through cinema). Exactly what Foucault had in mind when he devised the idea of epistemes is not entirely clear; more often he (perhaps characteristically) defined them by what they are not, avoiding any direct points of stability. Towards the end of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Archaeology of Knowledge</em> he does provide this set of details:</p>
        <p>By <em class="notranslate" translate="no">episteme</em>, we mean, in fact, the total set of relations that unite, at a given period, the discursive practices that give rise to epistemological figures, sciences, and possibly formalised systems; the way in which, in each of these discursive formations, the transitions to epistemologization, scientificity, and formalization are situated and operate; ... the lateral relations that may exist between epistemological figures or sciences ... The episteme is not a form of knowledge ( <em class="notranslate" translate="no">connaissance</em>) or type of rationality which, crossing the boundaries of the most varied sciences, manifests the sovereign unity of a subject, spirit, or a period; it is the totality of relations that can be discovered, for a given period, between the sciences when one analyses them at the level of discursive regularities. {Foucault l 986a: 191)</p>
        <p>Foucault goes on to argue that the analysis of the episteme is an examination of an 'indefinite field of relations' and is a 'constantly moving set of articulations, shifts, and coincidences that are established only to give rise to others' (Foucault 1986a: 192). This is a rich and complex set of ideas, and even though Foucault himself was later to acknowledge the critical problems of attempting to articulate such epistemes,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a3"><a href="#fn:a3">3</a></sup> there is much to be gained by considering these points.</p>
        <p>Once more we are confronted with the fundamental issue of cinema's conceptual relationship to something like the episteme. Are we dealing with cinema's cultural position as part of the epistemic formations? That is, how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is located within the wider issues of cultural epistemes; how it functions within, and contributes to, them. Or are we dealing with the idea of the episteme <em class="notranslate" translate="no">within</em> cinema? That is, a particular type of episteme which operates within a specific textual order (which is necessarily related to that other order at some level). The answer to these questions is to be found in a combination of the two, for even though they represent quite distinct interpretative approaches, ultimately they converge at a point where one can be seen to depend on the other. For the sake of expediency, and perhaps more directly relevant to the concerns here, we shall commence with the idea of cinematic epistemes.</p>
        <p>Foucault's point about epistemes not being knowledge, but rather primary forces and processes in the formation of knowledges (at a particular point in time, to a particular group), corresponds to the idea at hand here. The cinematic episteme is not a unit of meaning, or a specific interpretation of a film (or elements within a film), but rather how something comes to mean something within a film. It is the interplay among all these elements of the production of meaning that constitutes the episteme. Things such as generic conventions, intertextuality-transposition, the notion of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">auteur</em> as interpretative gesture, the historical positioning of the film (within its own diachronics - such as i i~ n <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kane</em> as technical innovation - and across others - such as the French New Wave as a moment in French and international <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> developments), are all part of the formations of epistemes. These are part of this Foucauldian notion of an indefinite set of relations, sometimes foregrounded, other times quite invisible. It is precisely this fluidity that marks the action of cinematic epistemes, and offers one explanation as to why films shift in their status of meaning. In one sense this is illustrated in the above discussion of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">eidos</em> of revenge. It would be possible to map out a sort of epistemic development of revenge, noting the (historico-cultural) shifts in production and interpretation, or the shifting emphasis in different epistemes (such as individuation being central to revenge in Hollywood <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> of the 1970s; or the emphasis on the dissatisfaction of revenge in the slasher film).</p>
        <p>Ultimately, however, any investigation of cinematic epistemes must be seen as not specific interpretative gestures, but the larger question of how meaning itself operates in film. How, for example, montage and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-enscBne</em> function differently to produce signs which are recognised as meaningful 'utterances'; or how, to take these organising systems <em class="notranslate" translate="no">even</em> further, the space-time systems, as analysed by Deleuze, are cinematic epistemes. In, for example, the section entitled 'The Powers of the False', in his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinema 2: The Time-Image</em>, Deleuze progressively divides the cinematic image into the regimes of the organic/kinetic and crystalline/chronic, based on distinctions such as continuity. He argues that the organic is recognised through its systems of continuity and linkage; progression is part of how the image is developed in this system. Yet within the organic regime, Deleuze argues, there are two orders: one which provides the image with a systematic set of connections (the 'real'); and another, premised on contrast, where the links are tested or even ignored (such as in dreams). Deleuze then posits the crystalline regime as that where 'the actual is cut off from its motor linkages, or the real from its legal connections, and the virtual, for its part, detaches itself from its actualizations, starts to be valid for itself' (Deleuze 1989: 127). This sets up a relationship of the different types of images transforming themselves and each other, which in turn allows for the construction of different types of narration. So, the organic narration is one of the reactions by characters to certain events and situations (emphasising the connections), whereas the crystalline does not rely on reaction, for the characters are swamped by 'pure optical and sound situations' (Deleuze 1989: 128) which they struggle to comprehend. Deleuze's example here is 'the Dostoevskian condition taken up by Kurosawa' (Deleuze 1989: 128), but another example might be Marianne in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Belle Noiseuse</em> as she finds her body as well as sensibilities confronted with the exposure to Frenhofer's gaze (which shifts between man and artist) to the point where narration itself is abandoned to the force of the purely optical.</p>
        <p>Deleuze performs this analysis of these regimes with one central project in mind - to continue his investigation into the position of movement in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, as it is defined in the cinematic apparatus, and as it defines <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself. This culminates in what reads as a defining moment on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and movement: 'Movement which is fundamentally decentred becomes false movement, and time which is fundamentally liberated becomes power of the false which is now brought into effect in false movement' (Deleuze 1989: 143). This point, combined with the ensuing discussion on consciousness and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, is where we most clearly witness Deleuze working out what can be seen as the episteme in terms of cinema's time-movement structures and properties. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Deleuze</em>, in this construction of orders of the image (movement), operating through time, can be compared to the development of a type of cinematic episteme. This, in turn, can be measured against Foucault's ideas on power and knowledge, which seems to be quite compatible with Deleuze's points on the false and power. Subsequently this will allow us to locate the wider sense of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif</em> within this discussion.</p>
        <p>When Foucault does shift towards what has become known as the genealogical method, he does so via the analysis of power and knowledge. This is succinctly put in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Discipline and Punish</em>: 'we should admit ... that power and knowledge directly imply one another; that there is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowledge that does not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations' (Foucault l 987a: 27). This is not foreign terrain for the cinematic episteme, for to understand how this operates is also to take into account the formation of a power/knowledge within the cinematic apparatus. These are the relationships which operate within the film itself, and within the other epistemic fields (spectator to film, film to culture, director to film, etc). Power/knowledge (Foucauldian theory merges the terms to suggest a composite as well as a new idea) can be <em class="notranslate" translate="no">seen</em> as Foucault's attempt to move the analysis of the epistemes into the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif</em>.</p>
        <p>This entire system of relations, including the production of meaning and interpretation, can be relocated within the model of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif;</em> not the one of Lyotard - although this is not necessarily excluded here - but a Foucauldian one, which incorporates power/knowledge as the underlying apparatus of the production of meaning. We have already seen how this operates in a number of different ways: in the theorising of the gaze we witness the idea of a struggle between the gaze and the eye, and between competing gazes; in the cinematic body we have seen how the corporeal is constructed within paradigms of power in order for it to produce knowledges, and have a sense of meaning; in cinematic discourse we have noted the relationships between power and the multiplicity of dialogism of competing 'voices'; and in the ensuing chapter we will consider cinematic strategies against the dominant discourses of power/knowledge.</p>
        <p>For Foucault the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositifis</em> a much larger construction than epistemes, for it includes these processes within its scheme. It is a disparate and multiple order, including 'discourses, institutions, architectural arrangements, regulations, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical propositions, morality, philanthropy, etc,' (Foucault 1980: 194). The underlying critical force of this concept is power/knowledge, arguing, as we have seen above, that one is not possible without the other. What is needed here is a consideration of how cinematic knowledge is produced out of cinematic power, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>The above example from Deleuze is one approach to this issue; the production of a relationship between the false and power operates very much within this idea of the cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif</em>. One of the clearest examples (and it is not distinct from Deleuze's project) is the function of the body as a site of power/knowledge in cinema. The idea of the appresentation of terror and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lacunae</em> of the orgasm are both premised on a relationship between knowledge (true/false, the good and the bad, its presence and lack) and the body. From such combinations we find a system of power produced - the power over the body, as well as the body's capacity to both resist and subvert power (that is, the power of the body over knowledge). The appresentation of terror operates through false knowledge (as well as lack), both within the narration and the spectating position (although these obviously do not always correspond with one another) but is driven by a power of the body <em class="notranslate" translate="no">against</em> this. Similarly, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lacunae</em> of the orgasm are a form of power over the body, but the knowledge (corporeal knowledge as well as acts of consciousness) of its absence produces sites of resistance. This is why <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is such a significant apparatus for the study of power/knowledge. This is true in terms of these examples of the body, but also much more widely speaking, such as consciousness, the socio-cultural, the historical, etc. This is the production of meaning within the cinematic apparatus, its production by <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> within the social, the relationship of meaning and the spectator. The combinations and variations of these produce what we shall term the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">epistemocine</em>, or knowledge/power in and through the cinematic apparatus. Another approach to this idea will allow us to understand better how this operates.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Point du Capiton</em></h3>
        <p>Lacan, in attempting to investigate the relationship between meaning as it operates within the Symbolic order, and the impossibilities of constructing such meanings in the unconscious, uses the idea of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">point du capiton</em>. These are, literally speaking, the buttons in the fabric of a chair. Lacan's metaphor is beautiful in its simplicity, yet complex in its implications. The fabric of meaning, this unending flow of cloth with its folds, undulations and creases, is impossible to arrest in its entirety, but the Symbolic order produces these moments - the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">points du capiton</em> - which fix meanings (for an instant or for what must seem like an eternity). Although Lacan would never have suggested it, the idea that there is a force effective enough to fix such meanings ties the model to an analysis of power in much the same way as Foucault does in his construction of power/knowledge. Our concern here will be how the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">point du capiton</em> model might be applied to cinema; that is, how meanings come to be fixed in the fluidity of cinema.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a4"><a href="#fn:a4">4</a></sup></p>
        <p>One of the fundamental aspects of the form a ti on of such <em class="notranslate" translate="no">points du capiton</em> is need, for a certain type of such fixing moments is derived from a necessity to understand a certain construction in order for it to appear meaningful. This is distinct from the larger orders of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">points du capiton</em>, which are derived from a socially and/or textually familiar pattern. A straightforward example in film would be the use of certain devices to signify a flashback or some recollection. These devices (such as the fade-out, the black screen, or waves of distortion) fix the meaning of that which follows as belonging to the past, and therefore having a different narrative attachment to the perspective found in the rest of the film. Any point designated as memory must be seen as having a direct link to the first person narrator, rather than the rest of a film which has <em class="notranslate" translate="no">been</em> constructed in terms of the third person, omniscient. These moments are predetermined through <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the</em> conventions of the cinematic discourse, as well as the social order in which the films are located.</p>
        <p>Our concern here, however, must be with a different sense of the operation of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">point du capiton</em> in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, where meaning emerges out of a series of particular processes. This is acknowledging the construction of a film as one of diverse and complex strata derived from, for example, dialogism, heterogeneous elements from the Symbolic and Imaginary orders, a play of transpositions. This, then, is a consideration of the investment of power/ knowledge in the cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">point du capiton</em>.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Parergonal</em> Logic of the Cinematic Frame</h3>
        <p>So far in this chapter we have considered meaning in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> from three different perspectives: the idea of meaning itself as an element, contextualised by various textual, intersubjective, and cultural processes; the relationship of meaning to power; and the processes which allow the spectator to 'fix' a meaning or to produce interpretation. This final section will be in effect taking a step back from these three, and will consider how meanings generated within the film are dependent on a relationship to something which is neither within the film itself, nor derived from outside of it (from, for example, the socio-historical conditions, or the spectator's own perspective and reading competence). This is the relationship of constructions of meaning to that liminal space which is neither included in, nor excluded from, the work, but functions between them and in them. This is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em> logic of the frame.</p>
        <p>Derrida offers the following as an introduction and definition to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>: 'neither work <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(ergon</em>) nor outside the work, neither inside nor outside, neither above nor below, it disconcerts any opposition but does not remain indeterminate and it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">gives rise</em> to the work. It is no longer merely around the work' (Derrida l 987b: 9). Although, in typical Derridean style, the ideas are two fold in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Truth in Painting</em>, (the investigation of an idea, and the investigation of that investigation ), it is possible for us to focus attention on how the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> functions in this relationship to cinematic meaning, its formations and its relationship to power and control. It is necessary to note that Derrida's primary concern (apart from his meta-investigative stance) and designated text is painting, and we must be aware that some of the more specific points made in the two books of interest here - <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Truth in Painting</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Memoirs of the Blind</em> (1999) - are directed at the discourse of the painting. That said, there is still much to be gained in considering <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in terms of the function of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>.</p>
        <p>One of the driving forces in Derrida's study is the idea that the space of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> has a particular relationship to meaning/truth;6 one which operates outside of it, and yet is also a part of it. Similarly, we need to negotiate the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> in order to understand what is being produced in terms of meaning - that is, how meanings that come to stand as such (that is, meaningful) are dependent on how we as spectators are positioned by, and position, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>. Derrida points out that the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> is not simply the frame however: 'It works the frame, makes it work, lets it work, gives it work to do' (Derrida 1987b: 12). This gives added impetus to the attempts here to discuss a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em> logic of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, for we can comfortably put to one side the frame of the painting, and look to find devices that function as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> in film.</p>
        <p>One way to approach the difficulties of this term in relation to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is to consider those elements which problematise the status of the relationship between the film and the spectator. One part of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> is the space which exists between the spectator and the film; a space which often collapses (in, for example, the appresentation of terror the space is negated in the horror of the image and its forces) in order for the process of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">suture</em> to take effect. Any intrusion into that space, any moment of acknowledging it, necessarily draws attention to the cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>. The self-reflexive moment in comedy when the actor turns to the camera, setting up a complicity between himself/herself and the spectator, functions within the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> because it belongs neither to the inside order of the film nor the outside order of the spectator. Dialogic processes, once acknowledged (or if they function in this self-reflexive manner, such as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Scream</em> films), are located in this same region of the liminal. Similarly, the foregrounding of cinematic devices, such as the French New Wave's treatment of montage, operates within the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>. The disconcerting cut in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souffle</em> (at the level of the visual and aural) from the kiss of Michel and Patricia in their flat to an aerial sweep of Paris is part of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>. This is not the kiss nor the shot of Paris, but the diegetically disruptive device of the jump-cut. Running counter to the conventions of narrative in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span>, such cuts end up problematising the status of the structure, as well as presenting points of negotiation in meaning.</p>
        <p>This, then, is the first point regarding meaning and the cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>: it suggests a space in which, neither inside nor outside the text, a number of different types of textual devices and processes are located. Often premised on self-reflexivity, these elements operate apart from the diegetic order of things. Their meaning is thus derived not from what has happened in the narrative, but external to that; and not from the act of the spectator, but textually internal to that. The meanings of such devices are distinguished from those derived from the other two 'regions' (the text and the spectator), but are also an integral part of these two. The second point to be made is that such constructions in and by the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> are mobile, sliding in and out of the textual order, and dynamic in their effect to change meanings. This is partly to do with the textual indeterminacy of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> (that is, it can be located in any number of different parts of the film), and also a consequence of the relationship of the film to the spectator, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>These effects of mobility and the dynamic are products of a number of qualities <em class="notranslate" translate="no">of the parergon</em>. Because it is not situated anywhere in particular, and yet also potentially everywhere (a quality especially true in the case of cinema), the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em> aspects of a text are not restricted to specific devices or representations. Its primary attribute in this regard is absence. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">As</em> Derrida states: 'the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> ... is called in by the hollowing of a certain lacunary quality within the work' (Derrida l 987b: 128). This is why the operation of the cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> requires the situating of the spectating position in much the same way as was discussed earlier in terms of the gaze and the mirror. This is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em> process of lo ca ting signs and discourses as relative points to one another, as well as the spectator. The lacunary quality of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> allows it to mutate, transforming common elements of film (such as montage and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em>, characterisation, the narrating point of view) into <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em> logic; that is, devices of the frame. Once this takes place then the meaning of these signs becomes foregrounded, for they come to stand for the impossibility of meaning within the film (that is, they cannot mean in the diegetic order like other signs might be able to), as well as the questionable status of meaning outside of (or from) the film of those signs.</p>
        <p>An example of this is the whole operation of time and memory in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Year at Marienbad</em>. Signs of time and memory usually have connotative values of reliable or unreliable, each path positioning events and characters in a certain way. When Walter Neff recalls the events that lead up to his death in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Double Indemnity</em> his memory is not questioned, and works both within the diegetic order, and as a construction of it. This memory is taken to be true because part of its function is a moral one; this is the confession of a man who has been wronged and has done wrong. The memory of the man in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Year at Marienbad</em> is located in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>, partly because of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lacunae</em> which feed into, as well as from, it, and partly because it is so often foregrounded and brought into question. This is also the case of the woman's function, for she is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">paregonally</em> located as she repeats, shifts, and alters time and memory.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> is that it contains (puts into operation might be a better phrase for part of its action is very much the catalytic - the work of the text, to recall Derrida) the excesses of the text. 7 This is both those qualities of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> that are rendered excessive compared to their usual use, and elements that are not normally located within film. To follow up this example of time, the films of Rivette are paced so differently from most other films, with shots going for long periods with gentle repetitions and undulations. This is similar to films by Duras (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">India Song</em> ( 197 5) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vera Baxter</em> ( 1977)) which interplay long dialogues with equally continuous shots of images. Duras's camera will track and trace, flow and explore images for themselves, almost against any narrative requirement. Bergman will do the same thing, only with an intensity invested in representing the workings of the unconscious as they become manifested on and through the body. The long, careful closeups of faces in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Persona</em> ( 1966) move the images beyond concerns with either space or time. These are excesses of time of the film. Other examples are those elements which are made excessive though an unusual construction. Examples of this would be: the struck match in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em>, with the sound and image operating within the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>, forcing the spectator to make connections with it because of the repetition, and the emphasis; the excesses of colour in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Wizard of Oz</em> (Fleming and Vidor 1939) which, initially at least, shifts the filmic signs into the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> because the framing world order of Kansas cannot possibly sustain such intensity. (This particular example illustrates how the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> can actually function outside of literal frames, but still function as framing devices.) The closing shots of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em>, with their vivid, cartoonesque colours, operate in a similar way. Here the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> operates to unsettle the distinctions made within the film between world orders. The everyday world of middle-class America takes on the same surreal quality as the dark world of Frank. It is the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> which contains these two orders of excess - the excess of violence and the hyperreal excess of the normal. Finally, there is the seemingly impossibly long opening shot in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Player</em> (Altman 1992), which seems to signal the excessive self-reflexivity contained through the entire film. As a comparison to this, note De Palma's similar extraordinarily long continuous shot in the opening of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Snake Eyes</em> ( 1998). The sequence is so unusually long (and hence contains a fluidity which contrasts with the more common cuts in an opening sequence to establish characters and setting) that the camera becomes foregrounded - a process which continues throughout the entire film. The spectator is reminded of the camera's presence through the breaking of certain conventions (such as the long take) as well as being shown it (the continual use of surveillance cameras, the theme of satellite cameras, photographs, etc).</p>
        <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> also has an unusual status in terms of the relationship between a text (in our case the cinematic) and its socio-cultural and historical contexts. As Derrida points out: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">'The parergon</em> stands out <em class="notranslate" translate="no">[seditache]</em> both from the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ergon</em> (the work) and from the milieu' (Derrida 19B7b: 61). It does this, Derrida argues, by standing out from the work and its surroundings, but also by merging them. ltis, then, both a part of the work and its contexts (defining them, forming them, giving a sense of enclosure, working them into a textual form), and apart from them (by exceeding them, by drawing attention to the very framing process, challenging their history and operations). The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> occupies a distinct site in terms of meaning, forits status of neither in nor out of the work and socio-cultural contexts means that its status of interpretation is foregrounded. The narrating voice of Holly in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Badlands</em>, because it both confirms and contradicts the actions on the screen, is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em>, and so the spectator comes to question all meaningforming devices. Derrida's 'metaphor' that the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> is like a figure that stands out from the ground (attached but distinct from) signals that it is something which is attached and recognisable. However, he also points out that it is the efforts to be invisible, to disappear, bury itself, and melt away (Derrida 19B7b: 61) that causes the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> to expend its energy. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Devil's Advocate</em> is essential to the narrative, as well as the moral and ethical meditations, yet it buries itself (through subterfuge mostly) quickly, only to resurface at the end of the film.</p>
        <p>The final point to be made here on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> is its relationship to the foregrounding of frames. This framing of the frame operates in many different ways including both a textually derived one as well as the positioning of the spectator, and the inevitable combinations of these. We have already noted that the operation of hypocrisis often involves precisely this critical moment when the spectator becomes aware of his/her position, and actions, in the framing devices. Such frames can be quite literal, such as the frame-tale structure in narrative, as well as more abstract, such as the conceptual investigation of the frames in some films. One of the attributes of this process is that all elements of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (which includes the act of spectating) can be imbued with the quality of the frame, and hence <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em> and liminality. Light in the thriller can operate as a conceptual form because it signals division, difference, generic conventions, and narrative developments; the steady-cam shot can be used to 'step outside' of the frame of camera shots (in, for example, the gunfight scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Quick and the Dead</em>, any number of shots in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raising Arizona</em>, or the final sequences in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Shining</em> with the chase through the maze), and in doing so the whole device of camera movement becomes framed and then exceeded. As with other devices of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">trompe l'oeil</em> (such as anamorphosis or the jutting-out effect in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Dutch</span> still-life paintings), the intent is to blur the boundaries between image and spectator, as well as challenge the foundations of the frame itself.</p>

            <li id="fn:a1">A key model for this originates in the works of Roman Ingarden, whose concerns were to investigate what makes literature literature, what gives it its <em>literariness</em>. See <em>TluLirerary Work of Art</em> (1973).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a2">See Chapters 1 and 2 for further discussion on the splitting of the gaze.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a2">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a3">This has been discussed in an earlier chapter on cinema and discourse. Basically Foucault radically reinterprets concepts such as the episteme when he attempts to devise a genealogical method, or the analysis of systems of knowledge and power. The discussion here is informed by that genealogical method, noting how the episteme signals an early attempt by Foucault to deal with these issues.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a3">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a4">Clearly one of the fundamental difficulties here is approaching the issue of film and meaning via the ideas ofLacan and Foucault, when both theorists had quite independent agendas and motivations. The ensuing discussion is not meant to imply a homogeneity between the conceptual points of Lacan's <em>point du capiton</em> and Foucault's power/knowledge. Rather this section is driven by the continuing ideas on how meaning can be seen to operate within cinema, and both Lacan and Foucault provide excellent points of departure for this.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a4">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a5">Hence Derrida's consideration of the <em>parergon</em> ofhis own book as part of the circle of investigations. It is noteworthy that Derrida is constantly caught up in these issues of analysis as <em>parergon</em> as he negotiates his way through Kant, the source and instigator of Derrida's arguments. At one point Derrida asks if what Kant is doing is <em>parergonal</em> - a question he also addresses to his own work (for example, Derrida 1987b: 63-4; 9-10).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a5">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a6">This construction of meaning/truth, like power/knowledge, is both helpful and ambiguous. We adopt it here to signify that part of the function of the <em>parergon</em> is to produce just such a relational context. This whole string of power/knowledge/ meaning/truth encircles itself so that formations of 'truth' become signifiers of power.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a6">↩</a></li>
