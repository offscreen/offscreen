        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Introduction</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Film and Theory</h3>
        <p>Deleuze concludes his two volumes on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> with a short reflection on the relationship between film and theory. He argues that 'a theory of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is not about cinema, but about the concepts that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> gives rise to and which are themselves related to other concepts' (Deleuze 1989: 280). In this brief statement we find a comment that summarises one of the most significant turns that film theory has taken in recent times. These theoretical developments have <em>become</em> more focused on the idea that what resonates in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is far more than the elements of the films themselves, and to understand what <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is, and how it operates, we must tum to these wider issues.</p>
        <p>This is the first major development in recent film theory - the recognition of the vastness of the scope of both the material and the theories. To understand film, that is, to theorise it, position it within different contexts (including the cultural, philosophical, political, etc.), and to develop analytic models, necessarily moves the points of discussion beyond the celluloid. The theories dealt with in this book, that is, the dominant theoretical models of post-structuralism and postmodernism, are vital to the study of film because it is through the complex ideas of these theories that we might come to better understand the nature of the cinematic apparatus.</p>
        <p>Another key development is related to this, and in one sense it is an inversion of the relationship between film and theory. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (both the various theoretical models of film studies as well as the texts themselves) has come to be seen as an essential part of a complex set of theories that have grown out of a number of different disciplines, including philosophy, psychoanalysis, women's studies, cultural studies, gender studies, deconstruction, and semiotics - in short, the sweep and turns, factions and fragments, of poststructuralism and postmodernism. Film has become essential to the development of many of these critical movements, not simply as a textual example, but as a direct contributor to the theoretical operations and concepts. One of the consequences of both these developments is that it has become increasingly more important for us to engage in a range of theoretical issues, and to acknowledge the vitality of these issues to the development of film theory. This is one of the aims of this book; not to attempt to map out all of the developments that have taken place in film theory, but to consider how film and the wider issues of critical theory have come to change each other. The result is not simply hybridisation, but the continued growth ofa series of new disciplines. From this point on, the relationship between <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and different theoretical projects has become entwined. The 'new developments' indicated in the title of this book refers to this dynamic process between film and theory. What this challenges is the idea of film studies/film theory as something only to do with film.</p>
        <p>Part of the relational context of film to theory is how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself has come to be a space and praxis for the analytic processes and issues. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the one textual form that has developed specifically within the theoretical contexts of structuralism, poststructuralism, and postmodernism. It is a form that has continually been surrounded by a devising of self-reflexive theories, many of which have directly challenged the established ways of looking at the world and how we operate in it. Gone is a sense of certainty, wholeness, resolution, and completion. They have been replaced by restless signs, driven by certain passions towards a status of the question and absence, rather than answers and presence. Of course other textual forms (literature, painting, music, etc.) have also shifted within these theoretical developments, but cinema's role has a certain uniqueness because it is the one born in the time of these theoretical challenges.</p>
        <p>If film needs theory, just as critical theory needs and enjoys cinema, we are then led to ask what does this relationship produce? The intellectual projects of poststructuralism and postmodernism, such as the interpretation and re-evaluation of topics such as subjectivity, culture, meaning, gender, power, discourse, pleasure, language (to name but a few), represent a profound shift in the climate of Western thought. It would be a sleight of hand to simply argue that these same sorts of issues are part of film's subject-matter, and therefore we need theory to work through them. <em>We</em> should always treat such a simple equation with suspicion, even if there are often specific cases where this is precisely what is taking place. What is more interesting - and this is what Deleuze is getting at in his summation of theory and film - is to examine how film its elf can be read as a theorising of these issues. So we move away from the usual interpretation of films as representations of certain themes, and then theory is applied to the texts to 'extract' such concepts, and towards a model that argues that theory and film perform the same sorts of tasks. What we are interested in here is the idea that the critical concepts of poststructuralism and postmodernism are themselves part of the film process. This includes the films, the act of watching them, the socio-cultural contexts, as well as the systems of interpretation.</p>
        <p>To consider these issues and relationships a number of the major issues of critical theory have been selected here. These topics have been selected in part because of their centrality to the critical developments, and in part because they offer fresh perspectives on how we might go about analysing the cinematic text. The book is divided into four sections, each consisting of two chapters. Ostensibly these four sections map out some of these issues of critical theory, notably subjectivity, discourse, culture, and meaning. However, there are a number of inflections given to these topics, in part to work as illustration, and in part to push certain lines of thought in different directions. By this we mean that the discussions of both theory and film are directed at offering different perspectives on these key themes and ideas.</p>
        <p>The first section considers the issue of the gaze, initially from the perspective of the formations of subjectivity, before moving on to examine cinematic aspects that cannot be held within a relationship of the spectator to image. Fundamental to this is the idea that the spectator's position and relations to the cinematic image tell us something about the larger issues of the formation and operation of subjectivity, textuality, and the social order. Four different concepts are employed to offer a range of approaches to this idea of the gaze and the subject. These are masochism, identification, phantasy, and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">punctum.</em> These four engage in ideas from psychoanalysis, feminism, gender studies, and semiotics, allowing us to consider how the gaze is part of the construction of a certain type of subject position. Chapter 2 considers this relationship of the spectator to the image from a more detailed perspective. Broadly speaking it deals with how certain ideas from Lacan's psychoanalytic theory and Derrida's theories of deconstruction might be employed in the analysis of film, and how film might be used to explore these ideas. What organises these two models is the idea of the excess and beyond of the image as it is constructed by, and constructs, the spectator. This analytic strategy is adopted throughout the book: the connections between theory and film as they aim for the same purpose, and the use of film to explicate theoretical points.</p>
        <p>The next section - on discourse - commences with a consideration of different theories on discourse, before focusing on some key ideas from Foucault and their cinematic potential. The first part of Chapter 3 considers some of the key ideas from semiotics, in particular Kristeva and Barthes. The idea of intertextuality is explored in depth, considering the movement from a simple textual referencing, to the more complex ideas developed by Kristeva. This leads to a point where discourse is seen as an unending roll of textual orders, where pluralism dominates. The second half of the chapter considers Foucault's ideas on discourse, particularly in terms of constructions of power and knowledge. What this means for film is that its discursive practices are diverse, heterogeneous, dynamic and invested with a particular type of knowledge.</p>
        <p>This is followed up in Chapter 4 by a more specific set ofissues, particularly how we might engage in the discourses of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in terms of the body. This is more than the representation of the body in film, instead arguing that film has devised a discursive practice that is driven by the body and its various parts. This chapter on the flesh and body also considers how different aspects of poststructuralist and postmodernist theories might be utilised to produce a theory of film discourse. These include Lacan's readings of the body and Lyotard's ideas on postmodernism, before returning to Foucault to re-evaluate some of his particular notions of discourse in terms of cinema. Of primary concern is the idea that we might speak of a formation of a cinematic knowledge that operates within and through film discourse.</p>
        <p>Chapters 5 and 6 are concerned with the relationship of film to social contexts and processes. Chapter 5 considers these issues through the example oflove, arguing that in order to understand better the cultural contexts of cinema, we can investigate how it treats a particular social phenomenon. The pervasive, yet heterogeneous, representation of love in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> makes it an ideal example. Two specific examples are taken up - the kiss and true love - to investigate how there is a cultural process in such representations, and yet at the same time there are resistances in any sense of shared interpretation. Put another way, one of the issues is how there is an interplay between cultural orders (such as love) and the challenge to how we might read them. Both the kiss and true love are common elements in film, yet they both offer problems in reading them.</p>
        <p>If both the kiss and love are part ofa recognisable cultural order (and set of representations within film) Chapter 6 extends the examination of how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> both fits into and resists social orders. This is film as it utilises both themes and structures to disrupt, challenge and sometimes even escape the rigours of social patterns and processes. At one level this chapter deals with overt representations of social disruption, in particular the idea of the carnivalesque. This idea is then taken up in terms of realism. By considering both the role <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> plays in disrupting social orders, and the disruptions within its own discourse, this chapter moves towards the idea that these disturbances actually have a positive, creative effect. This is traced through Lyotard's idea of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositifand</em> Kristeva's study of the carnivalesque.</p>
        <p>Chapter 7 considers how films produce and operate within a sense of meaning. This chapter takes phenomenology as a primary example of a critical model of meaning, before turning to other ideas, including psychoanalysis and deconstruction. This is not simply how a film might come to be seen as meaningful, or as having meaning. Rather it is a consideration of how meaning can even begin to exist in cinema, and what <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has done to expose a certain attitude towards meaning. The final chapter of the book - on seduction - is not meant to act as a point where all that has come before is distilled into a resolved form. Ratherit is a sometimes circling back over what has been considered in these earlier sections, as well as provocation of all that has been left unsaid. Seduction also becomes the metaphor for how meaning is always figured as a beyond in this theorising of film. We are seduced towards a sense of meaning, only to be drawn elsewhere. That is to say, that no matter how much we might try to resolve, what remains in both <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and theory is the seduction towards another point.</p>
        <p>Lacan, in negotiating the Reality Principle and the Pleasure Principle, makes the following statement: 'That whole organism seems designed not to satisfy need, but to hallucinate such satisfaction' (Lacan 1992: 28). We can adapt this description to say that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is not about satisfaction (of needs and demands, but also of the analytic questions themselves), but the hallucination of such satisfaction. This is not to lessen the power of the cinematic drive, but rather to illustrate the force of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> in our subjectivities, our cultural orders, and our psychical processes. Part of what defines <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is its role as a meeting place for all these processes. The hallucination of satisfaction that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> provides allows it to hold contradictions, splits and doubles without necessarily having to attempt to resolve them or even acknowledge difference.</p>
        <h3><em>A Note on the Films and Some Terms</em></h3>
        <p>A great many films are referred to throughout this book - more than 200 are cited as examples - and of these some are returned to and discussed in detail. The strategy behind this is that the interrelationship between film and theory is best handled across a great many examples. The critical concepts <em>become</em> clearer if <em>we</em> see them in different contexts, and the films are potentially enlivened by being approached from different critical perspectives. Similarly the concepts discussed shift according to what issue is at hand. Sometimes it is important to utilise the films to work through the critical theories, and other times the theories are there to offer analysis of the films. This fluidity between theory and film is also one of the key developments in film studies in recent times.</p>
