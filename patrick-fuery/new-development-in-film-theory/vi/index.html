        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Flesh into Body into Subject: The Corporeality of the Filmic Discourse Desultory Bodies</h2>
        <p>Following on from the previous chapter, our principal concern here will be to map out a particular type of film discourse. This is the discursive practice of the filmic body - which includes the body in film, the transformation of the body through film, and film as a corporeally driven form. In part this will be to explore further some of the critical issues raised by Foucault and Kristeva, but also to extend the idea of a filmic discourse, as illustrated through its treatment of the body, to other theoretical models and debates. The chapter will be divided into three closely related sections: cinematic libidinal economies; the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> of flesh; the corporeality of filmic discourse. In each section one of the central themes will be how film treats, constructs, displays, manipulates, and invents a pluralism of the body, and how those cinematic bodies pose powerful influences within the cinematic discursive practices. In Foucauldian terms the body becomes a <em>statement</em> as it is displayed in film, and filmic statements are transformed through the power of desultory bodies. It is this quality of <em>desultoriness</em> that impacts significantly on the discursive practices of cinema, and beyond them.</p>
        <p>Before proceeding, a short note may be useful on what is meant by the desultory body of filmic discourse. The active, almost unpredictable connotations of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">desultorius</em>, with its sense of the unconnected, the volatile, and the unstable, are well suited to the body in film. For it is not the consistent, homogeneous or even unified body that appears in film, but the random and the plural. Recall that one of the origins of desultory is from the circus riders (the <em>desultor)</em> as their bodies are thrown to earth, leaping from the backs of charging horses. Bodies are thrown and leap from films, not always in control of where they might land, or the positions they might find themselves in, or the contortions forced on them. This is the case not only in the more obvious examples of the body in the thriller, horror film and the sexualised body, but of all cinematic bodies. It could be argued that the discursive practices of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> are repressive ones in terms of the body; that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the containment and pacification of the body, producing a docile corporeality. This may prove to be the case in many examples, and it is important to consider how filmic discourse does have such a controlling effect on the bodies it constructs. However, we must also look to the disruptive and uncontrolled/uncontrollable aspects of the body as it is presented in film; how the excesses of the body always threaten whatever restrictions from the discursive practices may be placed on it; and how film itself forms such disruptive bodies. Further to this, it is the transpositioning and desultory aspects that move the corporeal from, and into, flesh, the body, and subjectivity formulated through the body. Part of this issue will be to ask what it is that renders the status of flesh, body and subject, and how is flesh turned into a body, and a body into a subject, and vice versa?</p>
        <p><h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Lacanomy and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Extimate</em></h3>
        <p>Lacan coined the term <em>extimate</em> to explore the idea of a something which is more than the most intimate, a something so deep within the subject that it seems almost foreign and, consequently, fearful. We can see a certain resonance ofFreud's ideas on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unheimlich</em>, that which is both the familiar and the unfamiliar, the homely and the uncanny.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup> The <em>extimate</em> for Lacan is how the unconscious is positioned and perceived - what he once expressed as the 'in you, more than you' sensation.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a2"><a href="#fn:a2">2</a></sup> Part of our concerns here will be to consider how film can give the body this extimacy by taking what is deeply intimate (our corporeal identities and qualities as they are formed by ourselves, and the interplay of this sense and the cultural contexts and exchanges) and exposing it as even more closely tied to what we see as part of our subjectivities. In this sense film makes the body more intimate, and yet at the same time has the capacity to render the body as something alien and strange to behold. This is similar to what the Formalists called, in referring to the literary qualities of literature, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ostranenie</em>, or defamiliarisation. Film is especially good at this because it can defamiliarise the body, giving it qualities that have been unseen and unthought of before, and still construct the body as something we recognise as part of the known. In one sense film is continuing a line, originally found in painting and sculpture, of exposing the body, transforming it as distinct from re-presenting it. However, the differences of motion and narrative mean that the body in film is marked and devised in many different ways, and ultimately constructed along different representational lines.</p>
        <p>To take what may seem a quite literal example, Emmanuelle Beart's body in Rivette's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Belle Noiseuse</em> is a filmed body rather than the painterly body it stands for, in part because so much of the film is spent showing the contortions of the body through movement and time, as well as the emotional repercussions of the naked body for the various characters (which is formed through the narrative). The final painting - denied to the gaze of the film's audience - operates in this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">extimate</em> fashion, for that which is most intimately constructed (the relationship between artist and model, the exposure of flesh, the history of emotions and relations) is the unrepresentable (for the audience) and the most feared (by both artist and model). It is this same <em class="notranslate" translate="no">extimate</em> quality that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blow Up</em> plays with, at first with the lack of it in the fashion shoots early in the film (these are merely cultural constructions of the intimate body); then through the tense conversation between the photographer, Thomas, and Jane when she comes to ask for the photographs; and finally to the deconstruction of the image to produce the questioned body in the bushes. The grainy photographic image - so impossible to read - has the same status of the extimacy of the body for the viewer as does the painting in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Belle Noiseuse.</em> It is made invisible precisely because of the excesses of the gaze forced upon it, and in doing so the flesh of the body becomes <em class="notranslate" translate="no">extimate.</em> In quite another way, and as noted in a different context, the figures of the Delacroix women in Godard's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Passion</em> are defined by their resistance to the motionless quality of the body that they have in the painting, but at the same time disrupt the cinematic shot in which they are a part. They reflect the character of the director and his inability to finish the film, because the bodies themselves rebel against the elements of the film. We find this same theme in another Godard film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Armide</em>, based on the music of Lully. In this short film, Godard poses the naked cleaning women - whose disruptive freedom is in contrast to their economic position in society - with the automatons of the muscle-builders. The rigid men are in effect motionless compared to the flow of the anarchic women. As such they exhibit what Cixous sees as the quality of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ecriture feminine</em>, to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">voler</em> - to steal and fly. The women's bodies fly from the phallocentric order, stealing gazes and power.</p>
        <p>This whole process of the body, with its motions and resistances, is part of what we might call the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">lacanomy</em> of film. By this term we mean to refer to three interrelated aspects: the economic drives as defined in Lacanian psychoanalysis; the libidinal economy of Lacanian theory; the anatomy in/of psychoanalysis. Clearly this is much wider than the specifics of corporeality and the discourses of cinema, but it can be brought to bear on precisely these areas. This will take us a step closer to considering the idea of a cinematic libidinal economy, and a few notes should help locate some of the issues at hand.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Economic Drives</em></h3>
        <p>In psychoanalysis the idea of the drive is part of what Freud termed the economic processes of the psychic apparatus. These are the three processes of the mind making up a meta psychology (the other two being the dynamic, the system of flows of pressure and drives, and the topographical, the 'structures' of ego, id and super-ego, and conscious, preconscious and unconscious). The economic deals with the levels of psychical energy and excitation, the aim being, Freud argues, to <em>keep</em> these low and balanced. An imbalance in the discharge of this psychical energy can result in mental instability. One of the important aspects of the theory is that this psychical energy, and its economic management, can be released through the body as well as mentally (as in, for example, dreams and para praxis). Two examples of this playing out of the mental in the physical are innervation and abreaction. Later we will consider the ways this issue is dealt with in terms of hysteria.</p>
        <p>Drives,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a3"><a href="#fn:a3">3</a></sup> Freud states, lie on 'the frontier between the mental and the physical' (Freud 1977: 168), which is particularly relevant to the concerns here. His most famous designations are the sex drive and the death drive, although there are others such as the ego drive (the motivation towards self-preservation) and the scopic drive (which was considered earlier in Chapters 1 and 2). These drives are based on certain antagonistic relationships and contexts. They are motivated by desires which cause psychical and somatic conflict because either they offer too excessive an action for other drives, or they are in opposition to the edicts of the moral structures (for example, the super-ego), or the aims of the drive are counter to those of other drives.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lacanian Libidinal Economy</em></h3>
        <p>Lacan specifies drives as one of the four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis and, like Freud, he deliberates on a number of the ramifications of these forces on the psychical and corporeal. In the following chapter we shall pursue the issue of drives further (in terms of ideology, culture and love), so for the moment we can restrict the discussion to a couple of points central to the concerns here. The libidinal economy in Lacan's works can be seen to be a reference to his treatment and analysis of desire, for in this we see both the centrality of desire to psychoanalysis, and the use of it as a critical tool.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a4"><a href="#fn:a4">4</a></sup> For the sake of expediency here, we shall focus on desire and the body, for it is in this that we witness some key points in terms of cinema. There are desires of the body and desires for the body - both of which find representation in cinema. The body's own desires, including those represented on the screen and the spectator's own body, are diverse, ranging from those fundamental ones (hunger, thirst) to the more abstract (the physical improvement of the body as desire, or the sexually voracious body as cultural construction, for example). These desires are part of the economy of the drives because they are also the nexus where the corporeal needs and psychic demands meet. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> both produces and satisfies (but only in a restricted sense) such desires, feeding into the wider libidinal economy of desire and the Symbolic order. The body's desires can be shown in forms of excess (the eating scenes in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Grande Boujfe</em> (Ferreri 1973) compared to the sexualised eating scenes (in a sense the conflation of sex and eating) in!Ji <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Weeks</em> (Lyne 1986) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tampopo</em> (ltami 1986)) or denial (the ravaged bodies of desire in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">.Naked</em> (Leigh 1993) ); as culturally defined through repression of desire (the body transformed in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Sheltering Sky</em> (Bertolucci 1990) which moves from an alienated European form to one metamorphosised in the desert; compare this to the hybridity of Lawrence's body in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lawrence of Arabia</em> - dressed in Arab clothes, but still has impossibly blue eyes), or through a total disregard for such cultural repressions. No matter where such representations of the body's desire are located on such a spectrum, they retain their impetus through the libidinal economy of cinema. The same can be said for the other axis, the desires for the body. Cinema, of course, sets this up constantly, and to understand more fully how this operates within cinema, both in itself and along with the body's own desires, we can now turn directly to the issue of the cinematic libidinal economy.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinematic Libidinal Economy</h3>
        <p>There is a type of economy which drives the material of film - <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Drives</em> as in the sense found in psychoanalysis: a process caught somewhere between demand and desire, devised in the conversion of energy and the qualities of release. This is not simply narrative or diegetic systems (although both of these are often part of the processes involved), but rather the intersection of the filmic reader, the textualities of the film, and the cinematic discursive practices. In one way this is an exploration of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">construction</em> (by, for example, the spectator or culture), rather than the readerly attributes, of film. The emphasis here is on a particular type of cinematic economy - one driven by the corporeal - which will be designated as libidinal, although clearly film is constituted by a multiplicity of drives. This is the force of the body as it drives the narrative, the diegetic, the discourse, the demands, the desires, and passions of the film and its spectators. The idea of the libidinal economy that we will be concerned with here is derived, in part, from Lyotard 's figurings, primary amongst these being his idea of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositif</em> and his rereadings of the concept of investment from Freud and Lacan.</p>
        <p>For Lyotard, the conceptual figuring of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dispositifis</em> a negotiation of philosophy (largely Kant and Hegel), Marxist theory, and Freud. It is not a concept to be comfortable with, as is also true of so much of Lyotard's book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Libidinal Economy</em> (1993). Yet it is this discomfort that also gives much depth to the points that Lyotard is making in both a broad sense and in terms of the effect on the reader of his book. As a project - the critique of Marx and Freud and the plausibility of such a conflation of theories - it is difficult to assess the success of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Libidinal Economy</em>, and even a retrospective Lyotard seems ill at ease with it. However, it does offer some possibilities for our study of a particular type of film discourse, as one of his concerns is with the systems of power and its manifestations. When Lyotard poses the question 'How does <em class="notranslate" translate="no">force [puissance]</em> give rise to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">power [pouvoir]?'</em> (Lyotard 1993: 19) he is concerned with an interplay between the social (its histories and practices) and the subject who is formed by, and operates within, it, and how these two must always be seen as distinct. The cinematic body as discourse, we can argue, operates as a site in which these distinctions and connections between force and power are played out. To rephrase this question in variable permutations: How does the body, located in cinematic force, give rise to power? How does force give rise to corporeal power in cinema? How does force give rise to cinematic power of/over the body? and so on.</p>
        <p>The status of the cinematic body may vary in its emphasis, but it will always be present. When we watch films we are almost always watching bodies; even the absence of the body in the frame (the sweeping panoramas of a Ford Western; the unending road of a road movie such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mad Max</em> (Miller 1979); the immeasurable distances of empty space in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alien)</em> necessarily implies the human body. It is the smallness, the finiteness, and often tenuousness, of the body that allows such landscapes to have these dimensions. It is worth recalling Bazin's point that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is all about locating bodies in spaces. There are certain types of films which invest heavily in the collocated body - that is, the body foregrounded and made presentational. The body of Bruce Willis in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Die Hard</em> (McTeirnan 1988) is continually hunted by the composing shots of threat and violence: it is stripped of clothes, made vulnerable, collects cuts, bruises and other wounds; it is defined by its fluids (sweat, blood, spit), its muscles, and its efforts. It is constantly placed against hard objects (elevator shafts, roofs, walls) and sharp surfaces (broken glass features as a recurring motif of the ease in which the body can be injured), as well as being threatened by other bodies; it is filmed in closeup to emphasise the vulnerability of skin, and in longshot to position it as fragile against skyscrapers. Ultimately it is this clash of bodies that signals the ideological function of the body in this film (and its sequels). It is the Americanised body- that of the supposed normal (American) man against the foreign bodies (the viral?) of the  <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ubermensch.</em> In the third film of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Die Hard</em> series the diegetic significance of the Willis body is further emphasised, this time in the contrasting ideologies of white and black American, with the characters themselves drawing attention to this difference. In these sorts of examples the body is never taken away from its contribution to the driving forces - the libidinal economy - of the film. However, even in films where the body seems far less emphasised, forgotten as it were, there is still a libidinal economy at work. One way of approaching this is through an anatomy of the body and its libidinal economic forces in film.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Skin</em></h3>
        <p>The skin of the body performs many functions: it is, for example, the barrier against the world and other bodies; it is the defining surface of the body and, consequently, the subjectivities; it designates age, race, life style, even class; it represents the line of interaction between the body /subject, other subjects (and their bodily representations) and the world. Lyotard describes the libidinal skin as being made up of'a patchwork of organs, of elements from organic and social bodies .. .like the track of intensities, ephemeral work' (Lyotard 1993: 17). Film not only utilises these functions of the everyday skin, it constructs them, emphasises them, makes them signifying practices in the filmic narrative, as well as the wider cultural and social contexts. I tis necessarily libidinal skin because it contains the potential, as well as the actual, intensities of a practice that contains both the social and the individual. This discourse of skin is possible because of both the apparatus of film (the closeup, slow motion and time-lapse photography, which can be extended to include the extraordinary effects of make-up and costumes) and the libidinal economies that the filmic discourse has developed. Some specific examples will help illustrate this.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pierced/sliced skin</em></h3>
        <p>Piercing skin, or the threat/promise to do so, carries a variety of connotations, including abjection, pleasure, fear, and power. Sometimes these are all contained within a single puncture (the vampire's bite for example); other times they are all present, yet represent a division of subjects and their bodies. There is a scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chinatown</em> (Polanski 1974) where the main character,Jake Gittes, has a knife inserted into his nose before it is flicked violently to slice the nostril. The knife is held there in a gesture of power and pleasure for the sadistic criminal (played by Polanski) and abjection and fear for Jake. The viewing subject watching this scene is located somewhere between the power and powerlessness of the two characters, wishing to avert the gaze, but unable to. However it is the flick of the hand, the cutting through of the nose, that makes this a slice of the filmic discourse of the body, because this is the moment that reflects the dark permutations of the film itself, as well as the possibility of all films to do this. It is not simply enough to have the force to inflict pain on the body, but it is the capacity (the power of the libidinal economy) to demonstrate that power. It is of that same order as the razor slicing the eye in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Un Chien andalou</em>, or even the slime-covered Ripley in any of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alien</em> films. Yet we may want to distinguish these discourses from, for example, the viewer-imagined earslicing in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reservoir Dogs</em> (Tarantino 1992). It not simply a distinction based on being shown the slicing of skin as opposed to the cuts and pans away to allow the viewer to imagine the scene. What is involved is a playing out of certain bodies as they become the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">punctum</em> of the scene, or even film. This is also the case when we compare such specific - and perhaps unexpected - scenes within a film's narrative and when there are excesses of sliced and pierced skin, such as those found in the slasher film. The expectation that there will be acts of cutting in such a specific genre undercuts the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">punctum</em> effect, reducing it to the level of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">studium</em>, that may be achieved in these other examples where the lacerations are less expected.</p>
        <p>What perhaps makes the shower scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho</em> so cinematically fascinating is that it actually manages to do both these seemingly oppositional things at the same time: it contains the excess of the slasher film, yet the body is never actually pierced; the shock is invested not simply in a brutal death, but in that it is Marion (the central character of whom we expect to invest the narrative direction) who is killed; and the length of the sequence is much longer than we would normally expect, or perhaps want. It is these moments in film that illustrate Lyotard's idea of the cut: 'There are no holes, only invaginations of surfaces. That is why when we cut open, we affirm only that which is, the vast coiled skin, where slits are not entries, wounds, gashes, openings, but the same surface following its course after a detour in the form of a pocket' (Lyotard 1993: 21). It is this preservation of the skin which makes the cut and tear so much more powerful and shocking, for in this affirmation of the subject's skin rests its <em class="notranslate" translate="no">extimacy.</em> In such a reading the cut and slashed skin remains part of the body - that is, the skin is preserved by subsuming the wound. In doing so the cut becomes part of, and then defines, the subjectivity.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Stretched skin</em></h3>
        <p>Skin's connotative values also include power through its tightness. The stretching of Sarah Conner's skin over muscles in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Terminator 2</em> (Cameron 1991) is much more than an accentuation of physical power. The comparison must be made to the continual references to the body of the terminator, for it is Schwarzenegger's body - its skin's tightness over muscles that seem altogether too large - that is the nodal point between the human and the non-human. Of course skin is a referential point in a great many science fiction and fantasy films about the non-human made to be human. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alien</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aliens</em> (Cameron 1986) it is the piercing of the skin, which is more than human, that reveals an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">extimati</em> relationship of the body between the two non-human entities (the androids and the aliens) and Ripley. This <em class="notranslate" translate="no">extimacy</em> is played out to its <em class="notranslate" translate="no">unheimlich</em> extremes in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alien Resurrection (]</em> eunet 1997) as Ripley's body becomes alien to herself, being more powerful, more physically defined, yet still human (which also works as the corporeal contrast of Sigourney Weaver's physicality to Winona Ryder's fragility). Because it is through the eyes that replicants are revealed in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blade Runner</em> (Scott 1982) as not being human, then other parts of their bodies must not give away this secret; their skin acts more like skin than the skin of humans. The final scene as Deckard and Batty fight across rooftops, culminating in the slowmotion death of Batty, is filled with examples of how Batty's skin replicates the human (bleeding, sweat, the traces of tears) through the closeups and lighting effects.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lips</em></h3>
        <p>There are moments in film where lips are offered in such tight closeup that their discursive qualities are emphasised and demanded. These qualities include intimacy, secrecy, passion, and transgression. The whiskered lips of Kane in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citiz;en Kane</em> as he whispers the words 'Rosebud' fill the screen, marking the moment between life and death. These are not sensual lips, but ones drawing a lonely breath for the last time. The lips of Michael Corleone in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Godfather II</em> (Coppola 1974) also whisper death (as did his father in the first film), but this time the intimacy is one that also alienates and repulses through its loss of innocence. The lips of Lawrence in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lawrence of Arabia</em> are blistered and cracked, not simply because they have been exposed to the desert heat, but because they represent, as much as Peter O'Toole's blue eyes and fair skin, the foreign West to the Arab world order. It is these lips, speaking the native language, that mark the similarities and the differences of cultures in terms of threat. It is the lips of Mia in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> which we experience first as they voice commands to a bewildered Vincent. These unkissed lips, as we witnessed before, are continually foregrounded as signifiers of threat. Recall the scene in the diner - it is her lips (and perhaps fingers) that control, demand, and threaten. This time the peril is located within social violence of organised crime and forbidden sexual desire. The unresolved debate as to whether it was a foot massage (the other end of the body to the lips and, supposedly, much less intimate) which led to the man being thrown out of a window, forms part of the cinematic libidinal economy, not simply because it is an integral part of certain narrative devices, but because it underlies the possibilities of violence, sexual desire, transgression, trust, and betrayal.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Tongue</em></h3>
        <p>The tongue, like lips, combines the sexual and the speaking. This has been used in films in a number of different ways, and sometimes much of the whole libidinal economy is premised on a slip of the tongue. The Rabelaisian excesses of the alien in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Killer Tongue (LaLenguaAsesina)</em> (Sciamma 1996) contains a sexualised discourse, as well as one on generic parody (of, for example, science fiction films of the 1950s, prison films and road movies of the 1970s, and perhaps even spaghetti westerns of the 1960s). The invading tongue in the woman's body is at first abhorrent, then assimilated, and finally loved. Its presence is only accepted once it begins to speak, for this is the moment it begins to be 'humanised', and then participates in the aims and desires of her. Part of this form operates at the level of cultural threat and difference; we find the same sorts of Hispanic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">contra</em> white America politics played out on the body in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Perdita Durango</em> (de la Iglesia 1998) when gangster killer Romeo Dolorosa and Perdita plan to kidnap and torture two American teenagers. In such films the white bodies are represented as repressed (sexually, culturally, ideologically), whilst the Hispanic are overtly sexualised and unrestrained. This representation of the Hispanic is parodied somewhat in the films of Almodovar and, particularly in terms of the blindness of masculine desires, Bigas Lunas (for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Golden Balls</em> 1992). The loving lick of the alien against Ripley's skin (in a combination of child to mother, as well as lover to loved) is initially repulsive, as with the killer tongue. But it also sets up a relationship between Ripley and the aliens which combines a strange acceptance of their histories and needs for one another. By the time we arrive at <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alien Resurrection</em> there is a symbiotic relationship between mothering-obsessed Ripley (continually searching for child substitutes - the cat in the first film, the child in the second, having revealed she had lost a child years before) and the reproductively driven aliens. The tongue caress, and nuzzle, by the alien seems to present a logical conclusion for both their desires. Another inflection of the metaphoric use of tongues and speech is the betrayal of tongues in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Name of the Rose</em> (Annaud 1986). The black tongues of the dead monks, as well as the long speeches (perhaps more true of the novel than the film), position tongues as central to the diegetic force of the film.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fluids</em></h3>
        <p>Inascene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood Simple</em> (Coen Bros. 1984), Ray, after discovering the murdered body of Marty in the office, starts to wipe up the pool of blood. The spectator is usually spared these sorts of acts - even <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> does not go into great detail in the cleaning up of the car after the accidental shooting - but here we are confronted with what is the nightmare of such a task. The blood doesn't soak into the cloth very well. It spreads further and further across the smooth floor. The blood covers Ray as a guilty signifier, defying easy closure and concealment. The fluid here comes to define the scene as well as the whole narrative track, involving the spectator in every part of the operation, stopping us from making a clean and easy getaway. Spilt blood leads to more and more blood and acts of violence. It also defines the cinematic body, for it is the evidence of that body's presence, and it binds Ray's body to that of the murdered body. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood Simple</em> actually plays with these relationships, shifting truths about them in typically neo<em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> style; so, the body turns out to be still alive (which in turn produces more nightmare scenes), the photographs of other 'dead' bodies turn out to be fake, and Viser, the detective, at the end turns out to be a case of mistaken identity. Fluids in these bodies, like the events themselves, are revealed to be insecure and unstable signifiers of what they seem to mean.</p>
        <p>Apart from death and woundings, another of the dominant depictions of bodily fluids in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the sexual - a dualism tied heavily to a Freudian backdrop of the sex drive and death drive. There are other examples of fluids: the extreme closeup of a saliva-dripping tongue as it licks a face in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Performance</em> (Roeg 1968), which signifies sexual freedom and an anarchic distance to cultural repression; the dripping nose of Bree Daniels in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Klute</em> (Pakula 1971) to signify fear; the dribbling mouth of James Cole as he hunches on the floor in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Twelve Monkeys</em> (Gilliam 1996) to signify madness; the sweating body in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Die Hard</em> to signify both masculinity and fear, as well as the purely physical. But such examples tend to be individual in style and intent, rather than what we find in the broader depiction of sexual fluids.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a5"><a href="#fn:a5">5</a></sup></p>
        <p>Censorship denies the representation of these fluids in mainstream cinema, so they are posited there by implication.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a6"><a href="#fn:a6">6</a></sup> In their absence these fluids come to define the body as something more dangerous, less socially controlled and controllable. Hereis a bodily function deemed too shocking to be allowed in mainstream cinema, so it comes to be represented as the other, in much the same way blood was in film before the 1960s - a convention broken in the USA, significantly, by the rise of cult movies by small, independent film-makers in Hollywood. The filmic representations of such sexual fluids are more threatening to the social order because they show a beyondness to the body. They cross the boundaries between flesh, body and subject because they represent subjectivity through the acts of flesh, merging the two into a different type of body, that of the unrestrained.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mise-en-Scene</em> of Flesh: The Cinematised Body</h3>
        <p>It is now time to focus more specifically on how the cinematic libidinal economy is formulated in terms of power and discourse. This is part of the spectacle of the body, which we can link to the body of the condemned. That is, it is held up not simply as a corporeal function, but rather as an identification of the institution of power and force over the body, and at the same time the body's potential to resist and disrupt these structures of power. In film the body becomes invested in a particular type of relationship to power and the formation of subjectivities. In this way we edge closer to considering when it is that the subject becomes a body, and how the body can be positioned as flesh. For it is in these configurations of power and force that so much of the sensibilities of the body are formulated and enacted.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Body of the Condemned as Spectacle</em></h3>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Discipline and Punish</em>, Foucault ( 1987 a) details the relationships between social institutions and the body, and how these relationships construct subjectivities and positionalities. A key part of this analysis is the idea of power, and as we are concerned here with the notion of a filmic discourse and its powers, it is worth recalling one of Foucault's key points about the nature of power: 'The exercise of power is not simply a relationship between partners, individuals or collective; it is a way in which certain actions modify others. Which is to say, of course, that something called Power ... which is assumed to exist universally or in a concentrated or diffused form, does not exist. Power exists only when it is put into action' (Foucault 1983: 219). (In such an interpretation we also witness a certain resonance with Lyotard's ideas of force and power.) The sorts of actions that Foucault has in mind are the ones he has previously analysed, including discourses of sexuality, madness, prisons, and medicine. Our concern here will be to consider how the body functions in film within the same terms of power that Foucault is articulating. In doing so we are confronted with two types of bodies - the body on the screen, and the body of the spectator. Rather than distinguish these two, the ensuing discussion will argue that they are inextricably linked in the formation and operation of the cinematic libidinal economy. Indeed this operation of the textual with the psychical (and corporeal) is precisely what this economy is all about. This link can be seen to be acted out within the domain of what Foucault called the political technology of the body, which is a knowledge of the body outside its functioning and a control beyond its subjection (Foucault 1987a: 26). The sorts of relationships that exist within the body on the screen and the body of the audience, as well as the cultural body (which we shall take up in a later chapter), and this political technology are in constant flux, determined by, and determining, power and knowledge. The cinematised body operates both within and beyond this political technology, offering compliance and resistance.</p>
        <p>According to Foucault, the most effective use of the scaffold (or indeed any public display of punishment) was its status of the spectacle. It was the body on display that allowed the power structures to be manifested and reinforced within the social order. It was the visual display of the punishment that manifested the control of both body and soul of the people by the state. It was the spectacle in which the power was invested and maintained, rather than any specific torture or punishment. The body became the surface on which social control was played out, not simply in the torturing of it, but through an exerting restraint over its rights. The body became a property once it was incarcerated because it was restricted in its space and time. It was this line of thinking that brought Foucault to argue that the soul was the prison of the body (Foucault 1987a: 30) and to formulate the idea of power/knowledge, in which was also found the determination of truth.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a7"><a href="#fn:a7">7</a></sup></p>
        <p>This model of the tortured, punished body held up for public display, determined through power and knowledge, has its equivalents in film. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> provides culture with a form of the spectacle of the body as it has been invested with these actions of power, truth and control. At one level, in order for the body to be filmed, and for that film to exist within the social order, there must be an assertion of power over the filmed body. (This is one of the ways in which the absence of sexual fluids, except in sexually explicit films, can be seen as an exertion of control over the body.) It is important to recognise, however, that this is not simply to say that the body, located within a filmic discourse, is rendered powerless and submissive; rather quite the opposite is the case. The cinematic spectacle of the body is ultimately an interplay between these conflicting positions of the 'tortured' and cultured body, and the polymorphic sites of bodily resistance. Film offers a continual outpouring of bodies that, in the desultorous manner, are manipulated and exploited, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">yet</em> also resist and subvert. It is the deconstruction of the power-knowledge structures that makes the spectacle of the filmic body so compulsive to watch. This is the case not just with those bodies that are excessive in their disposition (Ripley's powerful alien body in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alien Resurrection;</em> Frankenstein's monster's body in both the Hammer versions and Branagh's film with its closer allegiance to Shelley's novel; the body of Nosferatu as it reflects a dark social unconscious) but those that operate within a more closely aligned cultured body. Bardot's body in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Et Dieu Crea la Femme</em> (Vadim 1956) is a highly phallocentric and phallocular one, yet it is this same quality that allows it to resist the cultural through a challenge to the moral structures of the social order - that is, it has excess only in, and because of, its gender and the ways in which that gender has been constructed. The closeup of luminous skin to signify feminine beauty (Ingrid Bergman in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca;</em> Greta Garbo in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Camille</em> (Cukor 1936)) would seem to be a form of film spectacle which demands so much of the body that it is tortured (too pale, too smooth, too readily demonstrative of pain), and there certainly is a level at which this is a product of the power structures of the phallocularised gaze. At the same time, however, this skin resists because it becomes more than human skin; it is an impossibility through its seamlessness. Or rather it is, in Lyotard's terms (via Liebnez), an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">incompossihility</em> - the meeting of impossible worlds of perfect skin and harsh realities. So this single sign holds both the tortures offeminine beauty as well as a resistance to it. The character of Catherine's body in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Germinal</em> (Berri 1993) holds the same sorts of contradictions but in quite different ways. The feminine is constantly sublimated by the cinematic libidinal economy through the male miners and the viewer's own expectations. That there is no questioning that a woman should go down into the black, dangerous mines is never raised in the discourse; and yet when one of the men says that if she wants to be a worker she should remove her shirt like the men, even though the miners do not sexualise her body (or even draw attention to its difference), this is what the images themselves provoke.</p>
        <p>Foucault's concern with the body and systems of punishment leads him to assert the following: 'the body is also directly involved in a political field; power relations have an immediate hold upon it; they invest it, mark it, train it, torture it, force it to carry out tasks, to perform ceremonies, to emit signs' (Foucault 1987a: 25). We can add to this list that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself is part of these power relations - it <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cinematises</em> the body by positioning it within specific structures, and in doing so participates in these processes such as investing the body with particular traits, training it to represent certain relationships, marking it with specific effects and meanings, and emphasising its signifying possibilities. These cinematised bodies are also producers of knowledge - of a knowledge about the body, and about other fields of knowledge. In order to understand better this idea of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> tised body we can turn to some specific exam pies of the assertion of power over the body, and the body's resistance to these assertions, beginning with the altered body.</p>
        <p>The cinematised body is necessarily altered, even if the actual operation of this is hidden. Indeed, altering the body functions ideologically in the same way that semiotics speaks of the transformation of what is cultural to appear 'natural'. Within what is defined as the most stripped field of intervention - the documentary - there is an altering of the body as it is preserved, positioned within a history, contained, juxtaposed (often with other bodies it has never encountered). In this sense we are dealing with the mechanics of the body in film, a rendering of it into a textual form which crosses all other modes of representation. However, more literally there is also the altering of the body as a theme, and although these two processes of the force of altering the body by filming it, and dealing with corporeal manipulation and change, may seldom (if ever) interconnect, the two are not as distanced from one another as may first appear. For it is this intersection of the body on film and the body in film that creates the cinematised body.</p>
        <p>When dealt with as a theme, altering the body is often presented in terms of a threat or as more desirable, and so fits into a larger cinematic discourse on the body.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a8"><a href="#fn:a8">8</a></sup> This threat originates from a number of different sources, of which two examples will be considered here: the altered body of desire; the body as political site.</p>
        <p>The body can be altered in terms of its desiring functions in any number of ways: it can be made more desirable, as is evident in, for example, the female characters in musicals. The lead <em class="notranslate" translate="no">women in My Fair Lady</em> (Cukor 1964), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Grease</em> (Kleiser 1978), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Strictly Ballroom</em> (Lurhmann 1992) are all transformed into desired bodies. Or, in a different manner, when Orlando changes from male to female in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Orlando</em> (Potter 1993) the body is seen as more desirable by male characters. Thismaywellseemlikeanobviouspoint, butwhatissignificant is that this site of desire is actually stated - it becomes a point of relationships. Or the body can be made less desirable: Frankenstein's creation is the altered body, once desired, now abhorrent; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fly</em> (Neumann 1958; Cronenberg 1986) deals with similar issues of science-altered bodies. A totally different example is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Raging Bull</em> (Scorsese 1980) where the masculine body becomes firstly too violent (and then gone to waste) through its alterations. The body's socio-cultural status can be brought into question through altering the operations of its desires. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Some Like It Hot</em> (Wilder 1959) sets up such questions of gender and sexuality for both a number of its characters and audience; it can be posited as altered desire <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(The Crying Game</em> (Jordan 1992) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Last Seduction</em> feature trans-sexuality as potential sites of desire which emphasise the alteration of the male body; <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kiss of the Spiderwoman</em> (Ba benco 1985) traces desire as it shifts against gender and sexuality); it can be altered by desire that becomes an obsession <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Apocalypse Now</em> (Coppola 1979) relies on the altered body of Brando to physically demonstrate the force of an obsession; the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Godfather</em> cycle utilises physicality to signify obsessions); it can be an altered state of desire <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(That Obscure Object of Desire</em> (Bufiuel 1977) parodies masculine desire by constantly thwarting it, in part by making the desired body lack consistency).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a9"><a href="#fn:a9">9</a></sup></p>
        <p>Clearly not all these categories, and the examples given, possess the quality of a threat; in fact some of the desires represented in these films rely precisely on the alteration of the body to create desire. However, desire itself becomes problematised in all these films (and clearly the list could be continued), often in a threatening way because the alterations take place at the level of the corporeal. In doing so the cinematised body reflects the challenges to the political technology of the body (even if it often exists <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in potentia).</em> Even in those examples where the transformation of the body is seen as a triumph (notably, in these examples listed above, the musical) the issue of the desires of the body (as distinct from those for that body) is seldom resolved. The altered body is often presented in such films as satiated, but the body in the musical is caught up in a never-ending repetition of undesired bodies altered to desired ones, only to be picked up in the next cycle of musicals with the same sorts of transformations. This generically driven cinematisation of the body connects the films through transposition, and in doing so presents the body as unstable. Even musicals that are self-reflexive about their generic status, such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New York, New York</em> (Scorsese 1977) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All That ]a;:.;:.</em> (Fosse 1979), contain elements of the altered body and threatening desires. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">All That Ja:r.:r.</em>, for example, we find the desirable (altered) bodies of the dancers contrasted with Fosse's autobiographical character with his death-obsessed, pill-ridden, alcoholic body. The perfection of the dancers' bodies contributes to the threatened existence of this other body, somewhat ironically presented in terms of spiritual angst surrounded by very physical bodies.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a much clearer example of the altered body as threatening desire is where the difference of the body is also that which is specifically desired. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">femme fatale</em> of film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> is a good example of this. It is not simply that these women are beautiful and highly desirable for the male characters, but that they are also a body from the city (their dress, make-up, movement, speech, hair all signifies the urban). It is this urban difference that often makes the body an altered one, and one that is desired. The inverse model of this can also work on the same principle; the body altered to be more located in nature becomes desired for that difference. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cat People</em> (Tourneur 1942) does this quite Ii terally, but other examples include <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sirens</em> (Duigan 1984) (which utilises Lindsey's painting style to depict the Bacchanalian women); the beach scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dr No</em> (Young 1962) (which contrasts the civilisedJames Bond with a Botticelli rendering of Honeychild Rider); the forest scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Manon des sources</em> where U golin spies on Manon. That all of these examples are specifically women should not be too surprising given that within a phallocular dominated system examples of desired bodies from both culture and nature are often constructed from a masculine perspective. There are, of course, masculine equivalents, and we canfindmanyexamplesinsciencefiction (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Terminator)</em> and action films. We still encounter the phallocular gaze, only this time it is directed at the male body as site of desire.</p>
        <p>The altering of the body as a political site has been manifested in many ways. This type of process recalls much of Foucault's works on the prison, medicine and sexuality.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a10"><a href="#fn:a10">10</a></sup> Two types will serve as examples for this manifestation of the cinematised body. The first example is the politically dispossessed body, which has an underlying premise that the body is always positioned in terms of a political history of ideas and conflicts. The most literal example is that series offilms produced in the US in the 1950s (that is, the beginnings and developments of the Cold War), reflecting a cultural paranoia about communism. Films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> (Siegel 1956), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Them</em> (Douglas 1954), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Married a Monster from Outer Space</em> (Fowler Jr. 1958) locate the ideological take-over not within the psychological, but in the physical. It is the foreign/alien force manifested in bodies which look the same that carries the greatest threat. The body is thus articulated as a double threat: it is the ultimate disguise if no differences can be detected; and it is seen as the weakest part of the human subject (contrasted with curious ideals about indomitable spirit and strength of mind!). This is subjectivity rendered as flesh, with the body becoming the ideological site of control.</p>
        <p>A different sort of politicisation is with the classing of the body, notably the idea of working-class identities. The British director Mike Leigh demonstrates this in a number of his films, with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Naked</em> serving as a good example. Not only do we find the body as signifier of class (through accent, dress, or where it is located socially; its occupation is usually physical in nature, or often unemployed) but also it serves as a tableau of the destructive forces of the social order. The speech-impaired, limping, and bruised body of Sophie is a transformation of the body as class. In a similar way, the body is made abject through class and race in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Trainspotting</em> (Boyle 1996), only in this example the body is embedded in the antisocial processes of heroin and presented with ironic twists. Begby's vicious nature, manifested directly through his violent body, is never directly tracked back to class or racial issues (it is posited as psychotic behaviour), just as Spud's loss of bodily control in the bed (and then as the contents of the sheet are thrown over the room and people) is not directly linked to these sorts of reasons. Instead it is the voice-over of Renton which provides the link between the body and ideological contexts. His outburst on the Highlands, declaring that the English are 'wankers' but the Scots are worse because they were colonised by them, self-reflexively tracks the body into a political site. Similar comments can be made about positioning of the body in terms of race, with a subtext of the non-white body as other (that is, in this case, altered) to the white body. Spike Lee's films deliberate on this theme in depth, not simply in a binarism of black and white, but crosscultural conflicts and differences. The riot in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Do the Right Thing</em> (Lee 1989) is motivated more particularly than between black and white, perhaps as closely as specific neighbourhood variations on the wider themes of black Americans and Italian-Americans.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Perversions of the Cinematic Body</h3>
        <p>Another way in which these sorts of issues are played out is through the gendering of the body. Once more there are many ways in which this type of body altering has been dealt with, but to keep the range tight here the example of perversion will be considered. The perverse body, like all the bodies considered so far, is not simple to categorise. We cannot safely speak of a perversity which is inherent or stable - all depends on culture, history, code structures, acts of reading, psychic relationships, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">etc.</em> Even the very notion of perversion is problematic, implying as it does a sense of the 'normal'. Freud, who has had such an enormous influence on how the twentieth century tackled such issues, points out that deviations from what a culture describes as normal, healthy sexual desires and activities are very common. He states: 'No healthy person ... can fail to make some addition [to their sexuality] that might be called perverse to the normal sexual aim; and the universality of this finding is in itself enough to show how inappropriate it is to use the word perversion as a term of reproach' (Freud 1984: 74). This is how the term is employed here - totally without a sense of moral categorising or abhorrence. Instead, the emphasis is on that which is declared in the etymology of the term, to turn towards difference.</p>
        <p>It is part of the cinematic libidinal economy to invest all cinematised bodies with the propensity for, if not actuality of, perversion.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a11"><a href="#fn:a11">11</a></sup> The perverse body is produced at any number of different levels and forms, each one a variant or invention independent from, and yet interconnected to, a cultured notion of the perverse. If we narrow the field to perversion and gender, we are still left with a fluidity of form and interpretation, for theories such as psychoanalysis, queer theory, and feminism have all, in some ways, argued that it is the difference in gender that contributes to the production of ideas of perversion. That which is other (and othered) always retains the potential to be seen as perverse. Even within the gender divisions themselves there is a sensibility of the perverse; masculine discourse, for example, can readily produce a sense of the perverse masculine within its elf and for its elf.</p>
        <p>Does this then leave us with a term so unstable as to be critically impossible? If perversion is so relatively defined how can use be made of it to determine something like the perverse body? Lacan offers some interesting points which will assist us in all this. Lacan, in keeping with his Freudian backdrop, negotiates perversion via the scopic drives - of seeing and being seen. He argues that it is not the drive that is perversion, but 'what defines perversion is precisely the way in which the subject is placed in it' (Lacan 1986: 181-2). The cinematic equivalent here is this positioning of the subject (either the subject on the screen or the viewing subject, or both) into a situation which is a beyond to the everyday, which becomes the perverse. At one level this is part of the aim/desire of watching films, which may sound very Foucauldian in intent. As Lacan argues, 'the pervert is he who, in short circuit, more directly than any other, succeeds in his aim, by integrating in the most profound way his function as subject with his existence as desire' (Lacan 1986: 206). It is the operation of the cinematic libidinal economy which allows the viewing subject to merge these qualities of subjectivity and desire. And yet still the question must arise as to whether such an operation covers all cinematic experiences, and if so, is the cinematic economy fundamentally one of perversion? The initial response is, of course, no, as the experience of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is far more heterogeneous. Yet, defined within Lacan's sense of desire, subjectivity, demand, and positionality, there is a sense of perversion through the exchange of phantasy for reality in watching a film that must run through the entire cinematic experience. This is not simply the morally or ethically perverse of a social order (such as the representation of gay love in a homophobic culture, or interracial love in an apartheid system), but the cinema's capacity to challenge reality by representing desire, and the viewing subject's psychic responses and interactions to this. Any apparatus (of which <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is one) which can produce the sorts of effects that Lacan attributes to the perverse (desire as existence and function) operates within that paradigm, even if this is a broad spectrum. Given this, it is perhaps useful to once more attempt to distinguish between a representation of the perverse body, and this broader sense of the cinematised body as perverse in its relationship to the viewing subject (and, consequently, this subject's perversity in its relationship to the cinematised body).</p>
        <p>This notion of the perverse body can be seen to be presented in many ways, the issue of gender being but one of many, even if it is a fundamental one. Certainly the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> of Greenaway, Lynch and Cronenberg leap to mind as ones populated by the body made perverse. However, it is far too problematic to group these together - which illustrates the wider difficulties of ascribing a cinematic perversion which encompasses all variants and forms. Greenaway's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover</em> (1989), Lynch's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em> and Cronenberg's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Crash</em> ( 1997) all evoke notions of culturally defined perversions, often played out through the body. All three films link eroticism with violence, positioning those characters (the thief in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cook</em>, Frank in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em> and perhaps all the main characters in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Crash</em>, but certainly James and Catherine Ballard) as sexually perverse. Yet at the same time, all the films rely on the device of voyeurism and seduction to link what the spectator is doing to what is happening in the films. This is also found, at another level, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rear Window</em>, for the perversion across the courtyard inverts and parallels the perversions of the bodies and relationship between J elf and Lisa. Their scopic drive, and panoptic position, draws them into more perversions, which they themselves acknowledge. They find themselves willing a murder to have taken place, demonstrating disappointment when they seem to be wrong.</p>
        <p>The lovers in all these examples are all watched and become watchers - that is to say, they occupy the liminal site of recognising the perverse sexuality and gendering of the Other, but then become part of it. This is in keeping with Freud's point that the one force which directly opposes scopophilia is shame (see, for example, Freud 1977: 69-70). However, it is this post-voyeuristic relationship that redefines the character's propensity to the perverse. The characters in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Crash</em> are destined to continue to play out the perversities until the inevitable end; Jeff, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em>, attempts to return to a normality, but this is presented as another form of perversion (one of a hyper-real suburbia); the lovers] ames and Catherine close <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Crash</em> with the words of'Perhaps next time'. This sense of a cycle is perhaps more heavily inscribed into the relationship of perversity and subject's sexuality and gender than may first appear to be the case. There is a resistance to closure because the body itself cannot find stasis (literally death, but there are a great many other variants). Even in a situation where such a 'return' should be impossible through a lack of desire, the insertion of the abject, and a type of cultural/historical abhorrence - such as that of the Jewish woman from a concentration camp and the Nazi guard, in Cavani's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Night Porter</em> ( 1974) - the compulsion to repeat seems impossible to deny.</p>
        <p>These orders - the political body and the body of desire - illustrate Foucault's points regarding the panopticon and the watched body.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a12"><a href="#fn:a12">12</a></sup> This is the body as it is displayed, but it is also the play of power over the body. As Foucault puts it: 'Power has its principle not so much in a person as in a certain concerted distribution of bodies, surfaces, lights, gazes; in an arrangement whose internal mechanisms produce the relation in which individuals are caught up' (Foucault 1987a: 202). This panoptic effect can work in three different ways in cinema: it can be represented within the film itself (the systems of surveillance, the sense of being watched - nothing can be hidden from the camera after all); this can lead to the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> forming part of the panoptic effect for the spectator (the sense that the film being watched is actually watching you through its representations, as well as its techniques); and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> can work against the panoptic effect, either by exposing it (so once we become aware of panopticism we can resist it) or operating at a subversive level to it. Within all of this is the body, resisting or complying, subverting or being contained. Its movements from flesh to body to subject, and back again, are filled with the potential of resistance and compliance. And each body on the screen holds all these qualities at the same time.</p>
        <p>Kristeva (1982) speaks of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">corpspropre</em> (one's clean and proper body) and abjection in a detailed analysis of the operation of the body and mind, and their textual and cultural significations. What we find in all these examples of the cinematic body is an interplay between the idealism of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">corpspropre</em> as it is positioned as part of the Symbolic order and its cinematic representations, and the body which must take in the impurities, including those of vision. This is not simply a case of the body on the screen compared to the body of the spectator, but more a process involving the Symbolic ordering of the body and the corporeal and psychical interventions on that. Both the politicised body and the body of desire attain that particular status because they represent bodies which have been transformed from some sense of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">corps propre</em> into a type of corporeality. In this way they are further inflections of the wider process of the cinematising of the body itself. The culmination of this in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is that we can speak of a corporeality of the filmic discourse. Film is driven in, by and through the body. Not a simple body, but one that resists and demands, is socialised and resists any social conformity, is disempowered and subversively all powerful. It is a discourse of corporeality which is constituted of flesh, body, and subject, and in turn comes to constitute them. Cinema's relationship to the body is much more like the operation of the symptom as it manifests disguised signs as marks on the corporeal.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a13"><a href="#fn:a13">13</a></sup> Cinema's discourse is the discourse of the body.</p>

            <li id="fn:a5">We will not take up another of the major forms of body fluids here - that of tears - in part because their representation is usually self-evident. Categories such as the fearful tear, that of sorrow, and of joy, are all culturally established and mostly operate within well-defined parameters.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>

            <li id="fn:a7">Foucault's notion of power is directly related to knowledge. For him 'power produces knowledge' and 'power and knowledge directly imply one another' (Foucault 1987a: 27).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a8">The related idea of the abject body will be taken up in the next section of this chapter, and for this reason perhaps the most obvious examples of altered bodies, their desirability and threat, which take place in horror and thriller films will not be developed here.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a9">Buiiuel even uses two different actors to play the same character. This altered body is never questioned by any of the characters in the film.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a10">See <em>History of Sexualiry</em> (three volumes); <em>Madness and Civilisation</em> ( l 987b); <em>Discipline and Punish</em> (1987a); <em>The Birth of the Clinic</em> (1975).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a11">It is interesting to note, in terms of the scopic drive being so essential to cinema, that Freud positions the visual central to libidinal economies: 'Visual impressions remain the most frequent pathways along which libidinal excitation is aroused' (Freud 1977: 69).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a12">Briefly, the panopticon is an idea derived from Bentham's 1840s plan for a prison where the buildings of the cells surround a central tower. The guard can see into the cells, but the prisoners cannot see if the guard is in the tower or not. Thus there is no need even to have someone in the tower as the prisoners will always have to assume that they could be being watched. Foucault takes this as a model for the larger processes in a culture which produce self-surveillance. The gaze becomes the efficient system for the manifestation of power and control. For Foucault it is a fundamental element of our social order: 'We are much less Greeks than we believe. We are neither in the amphitheatre, nor on the stage, but in the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which we bring to ourselves since we are part of its mechanism' (Foucault 1987a: 217).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a13">In this sense what Lacan means when he talks about the symptom works equally well in terms of cinema: 'When deciphered, it appears as self-evident, imprinted upon the flesh, the omnipresence for the human being of the Symbolic function' (Lacan 1985: 127).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a1">↩</a></li>
