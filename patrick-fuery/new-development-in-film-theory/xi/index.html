        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Glossary: New Developments in Film Theory</h2>
        <p>Lacan, in a typical poststructuralist gesture, argued that his terms should not be defined, rather their meaning should be arrived at within the context of their usage, the processes of analysis, and the working out of the problems. This is part of the reason why we find so much fluidity and play within the terms themselves. Within such a sense it is always difficult to provide a standard sort of glossary of the terms, and the following is intended as a guide to some of the key theoretical terms discussed throughout the book. Most of the terms are notoriously slippery and caution must always be exercised in such summaries. The following is framed with a sense of open-endedness and the reader is encouraged to follow up the concepts in the primary texts from which they originate. (Wherever possible the relevant text is given in the definition.)</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Abjection</strong> Through Kristeva’s book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Powers of Ho’or</em> (1982), this term has passed from its anthropological origins (especially Mary Douglas) into the areas of psychoanalysis specifically and poststructuralism generally. From this perspective, the term has taken on both a cultural and psychical sense, thus becoming an important development in theorising subjectivity. The abject, for Kristeva, is both a cultural force and a part of the psychical apparatus, notably the unconscious. As such it is seen as a crucial factor in understanding how these two complex processes operate and interact. In abjection the sense of the self is threatened by those things that can cross, and so defy, the imagined sense of the body and its boundaries. One such example is bodily fluids - blood, urine, semen, tears - which mark the transgression of the body as whole and perfect. A consequence of this is that anything associated with these signs of abjection comes to threaten subjectivity itself. Part of cinema’s role is to allow the acting out of abjection, both at the cultural level and in the subject’s psychical processes. It is the power of abjection to challenge and disrupt, to place the known into the liminal and on the borders, that gives its cinematic manifestations so much potency.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Aphanisis</strong> A key term from Lacan ( 1986) who shifts its original psychoanalytic meaning so that it comes to represent a particular process in the subject’s interaction with the Symbolic order. Along with alienation, aphanisis represents a fear of the loss of those signifiers which have come to represent subjectivity. Lacan argues that the subject invests certain signifiers with immense psychical value, so that their loss (or even potential for this) represents a loss of identity within the Symbolic order.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Appresentation</strong> (see also <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lacunae)</em> This term, derived from phenomenology, refers to the idea that all phenomena are presented as incomplete and part of the act of consciousness is involved in adding further information and details. Where such information comes from will depend on the particular object or sensation, but certainly memory, cultural conditioning, and, in the case of texts, the contextual fields, all play a part. Appresentation can be seen as both a fairly mechanical process (the adding to of signs and representations to make them seem complete) as well as the more abstract and complex - such as how ideology operates to make certain constructions seem more valid.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Codes</strong> In semiotics the role of codes is complex (see, for example, Eco’s discussion in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Theory of Semiotics</em> (1976)) and the relative simplicity of some of the descriptions can be deceptive. Codes order signs, as well as provide rules of exclusion, combination, and hierarchy. As such they are fundamental to the ways in which meanings are produced and signs interpreted.</p>
        <p>Peter Wollen’s early work <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Signs and Meaning in the Cinema</em> ( 1969) provides an example of some rudimentary issues in cinematic codes and how they operate. In one sense they are comparable to the operation of generic conventions, but it is also necessary to consider how they operate beyond the textual boundaries. Barthes’s (1977) work on codes of fashion and food, for example, demonstrates the wider cultural implications and operations of codes. Metz (1973, 1974) offers a sustained examination of codes in cinema, utilising complex semiotic theory to argue for a language of film.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Difftirance</em></strong> From Derrida, a term emphasising the indeterminate nature of meaning and interpretation. The neologism is derived from the meaning being made up of deferral and difference: all acts of meaning and interpretative gestures involve deferring the arrival at a particular meaning; and within every act of interpretation there is the process of difference. In many ways this term has become representative of deconstruction as a method, demonstrating how the issue of meaning itself is central to its investigative field.</p>
        <p>For Derrida the term represents a critique of how Western philosophy has devised systems of analysis and the production of meaning. In this sense it is as much a philosophical stance as any analytic tool. His principal concern is how philosophy as a discipline has attempted to establish itself within a privileged position of interpretation. This is what he calls the white metaphor of all systems of truth (see, for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Margins of Philosophy</em> (1986)), as certain hermeneutic positions argue that they are more insightful, more truthful, than others. Derrida then extends this examination to all systems of knowledge, cautioning against any such privileging. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Diffirance</em> is one of his strategies to deconstruct the very idea of a central, single, and universal truth.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Episteme</strong> We take a particular inflection given to this term by Foucault here. This is the formation of knowledges through power, and the study of them in terms of such a context. However, Foucault is quite explicit that epistemes are not simply knowledge as it is socially constructed, but rather emphasises the relationships between knowledges as they produce discursive practices. It is these relationships that form the epistemes (see especially Foucault, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Order of Things</em> (1970) ).</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Epistemocine</strong> We coin this term to speak of the ways in which the Foucauldian idea of power/knowledge as it operates in the formulation of meaning is devised within cinema. These, then, are units of meaningful ‘utterances’ (sounds, images, segments of action, lighting, etc.), formed within a film, operating through a power/knowledge process - which can include the textual, cultural, sexual, and so on. This is also in keeping with Foucault’s ideas on relationships and meaning {see above).</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Glissading bar</strong> From Lac an, referring specifically to an interpretation of the structure of the sign. Lacan draws on semiotic theory to present a model of the unconscious, where meaning is derived from the slippage between the signifier and the signified; or between the representations in the conscious and the repressed drives and desires of the unconscious. The sliding (glissading) bar is part of the mechanism which allows for the disguising of such unconscious ideas (see Lacan, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Four Fundamental Concepts</em> ef <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psychoana? Jsis</em> ( 1986)). Because it is a critique of how meanings are formulated, this notion of the sliding bar ties in with a great many other poststructuralist and postmodernist projects. See, for example, Derrida’s notion of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em>.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">lmaginary; Symbolic; Real</strong> Lacan developed three terms - the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real - over a period of years, and they have become wedded in a system of concepts on subjectivity, the unconscious, and the social order. The Imaginary has its emphasis on the image (rather than a sense of fantasy as first seems to be the case in the use of such a term) as it forms a self-reflexive moment of the subject. This idea stems from Lacan’s theory of the Mirror Stage. At around 18 months the child becomes aware of his/her social position, and is forced to move from the egocentric position into the social world of language. This, according to Lacan, causes considerable trauma and represents a splitting of the subject’s sense of the self, from which we never fully recover. The Imaginary is the moment of this realisation of the self as split (the/ <em class="notranslate" translate="no">chspaltung)</em> .</p>
        <p>The Symbolic is Lacan’s term for the social order (organised through the signifier). It is the large and complex social structures into which the subject must enter. It is also the site where the signifier - that is, all systems of communication and representation - is produced, struggled for, and lost. It is noteworthy that the Mirror Stage also marks the sexualising of the subject, and the demands to operate within culturally determined gender positions. This means that, for psychoanalysis, the entry into the Symbolic order also marks a repression of certain sexual drives (Freud’s notion that we are all bisexual to begin with), the assertion of the Oedipal complex, and a demand to represent desires within a particular cultural order.</p>
        <p>The Real is perhaps the most difficult of the three terms to tie down. It certainly holds the other two within a relational context, but also stands outside of them. At one level it is what we might also consider to be the unconscious, with its antisocial drives and desires. The Real, as Lacan once said, is the impossible; it is that which is lacking in the Symbolic order. Lacan terms it the Real because it relates not to social reality, textual realism, or the reality of objects and things; rather it is the real of the psyche, and all that operates within it.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lacunae</em></strong> From phenomenology and developed extensively in reception theory (see especially Roman Ingarden and Wolfgang Iser). <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lacunae</em> (also known as spots of indeterminacy) are the ‘missing’ parts of the text, requiring the participation of the reader /spectator. They are defined as key elements in the active construction of the text by the reader, and as such became a fundamental part of the death of the author idea. Part of this process is what phenomenology terms concretisation. This is the reader’s necessary act of completing the text which is full of these indetermined moments.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Mirror Stage</strong> (see Imaginary)</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Objet petit a</em></strong> A term from Lacan that denotes the formation of objects of desire. Lacan distinguishes these little objects of desire (the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">'a'</em> stands for the French term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">autre,</em> other) from the big A Other as a type of cultural register of desirable moments. The Other itself remains elusive and always beyond the subject.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Phallocentrism and Phallocularism</strong> From feminist theory, phallocentri.sm was seen as central to masculine discourse and its assertive control not only over material possessions, but also language and cultural formations. As such it was seen as actually shaping the psychic apparatus as well as having this wider social sense to it. Feminist theory distinguishes the phallus (this idea of masculine power and domination) from the biological penis, and thus men themselves are subjected to a type of power relation to phallocentri.sm. We have coined the term phallocularism here to suggest the idea of a masculine gaze constructed precisdy out of this socio-economic and psychical site of subjectivity.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Readerly and Writerly</strong> From Barthes, the idea that there can be different levels of participation by the reader in the text. AlthoughBarthes’s description sometimes seems like a system of textual classification, the emphasis is very much on the idea of the active (writerly) and passive (readerly) acts of the reader/spectator. It is important to recognise that Barthes never prescribes the qualities of the readerly and writerly to specific texts, for what may seem to be a passive encounter with a particular text in one instance, may subsequently operate at a much more creative and active level. It is the role and function of the reader, along with factors such as textual histories, interpretative models, even reading fashions, that transforms texts from one type to another. These terms parallel another set of ideas developed by Barthes, the work and the text.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Real</strong> (see Imaginary)</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Scopophilia</strong> Most simply put this is the pleasure of looking. According to Freud it is, along with exhibitionism, an essential part of the normal formations of the socialised subject. However, scopophilia becomes more problematic when it replaces the development of adult sexual relations and becomes the primary form of interaction. It became a crucial term in film theory in the 1970s (through Mulvey’swork), but more recently there has been a re-evaluation of how this term might be best employed. Mulvey and others emphasised the idea of the power in the male gaze and how it makes women seem to be passive objects. In this sense scopophilia is part of the phallocentric discourse, forming moments in cultural operations of the image. However the pleasure of the gaze is never simply masculine because there is also an incitement of power against it. In these terms - especially from Foucault and some of the French feminists - pleasure is a much more destabilised, and destabilising, process.</p>
        <p><strong class="notranslate" translate="no">Subjectivity</strong> One of the largest and most complex issues of critical theory, discussions of subjectivity are part of every major theoretical idea from poststructuralism and postmodernism. This is because from all the different aspects - such as psychoanalysis, feminism, cultural studies, deconstruction, semiotics - there has been a radical rethinking of the subject and how he/she operates within cultural and textual systems. The dominant model of the subject in Western thought came from the eighteenth century’s Enlightenment where it was seen as whole, stable and at the centre of all things. This has been replaced with ideas that the subject is never whole, but rather fragmented and split, constantly driven by unconscious desires and demands. The subject is also split from the cultural order by its lack of control of the signifying practices. In these terms there is little stability in the subject, instead a constantly changing and charged entity.</p>
