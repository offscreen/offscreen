        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dangerous Supplements and the Envy of the Gaze</h2>
        <p>The theorising of the relationship between film and the spectator has become increasingly more complex in recent years. This has partly to do with the development of certain theoretical approaches which emphasise the role of the spectator as an active agent in the construction of the text, as well as a development of those theories that focus on positions of subjectivity and intersubjective processes. This has developed out of a complex set of theories that have radically rethought the whole idea of what constitutes subjectivity. It is these ideas on the subject that will inform much of the ensuing discussion. To work through some of these developments this chapter will consider two distinct perspectives: some of the key models of the gaze developed by Lacan, and a number of ideas from Derrida's works of deconstruction. We have already encountered aspects of the first of these in the previous chapter. However, there are a number of very significant ideas and models which, for various reasons, have not been nearly as extensively developed in the area of film studies. Similarly, Derrida's theories have been much less systematically examined and applied to film, but there are a number of ideas that offer a radical rethinking of how we might approach film itself.</p>
        <p>The first half of this chapter will explore in more detail some of the key concepts from Lacanian psychoanalysis and how it has problematised the whole issue of the subject. This will include examining how Lacan links the scopic drive to the formation and destabilising of a certain type of subject position. This in tum will allow us to consider how the film spectator occupies a particular type of subject position, as well as some of the broader issues of subjectivity in these contexts. The second half of the chapter will look at some ideas from Derrida, in particular how we might utilise his notion of the supplement to better understand the operation of the spectator in film. Clearly these two theoretical sources - psychoanalysis and philosophy - are far from unified in their approach to such issues. What is of primary interest here, however, is interpreting the differences of the subject in this capacity of spectating, and how we might reinterpret this essential aspect of film studies.</p>
        <p>Lacan's idea of the mirror stage has held a particular fascination for film theory for many reasons. This theory, as was noted in the previous chapter, is directed not simply at how we look and are looked at, but deals with ideas about the formation of the subject, the intervention of culture, and the negotiations of meaning through desire.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup> It is a powerful and significant theory that informs and illustrates a great deal ofLacanian psychoanalysis and its applicability to other disciplines and ideas. It also has a logical connection to film analysis, with its emphasis on the gaze and the scopic drive. There are, however, other parts of Lacan's seminars that contain significant readings and explorations of the theory of the gaze, and it is to these that the first part of this chapter is directed. We can also review some of the key elements of a Lacanian approach to film.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Imaginary and the Drive</h3>
        <p>A great deal of the work on Lacan's theories of the gaze, the relationship of the subject to the act oflooking and being looked at, and, subsequently, the intervention of psychoanalysis in the study of film, is derived from two interconnected ideas: the Imaginary, and the drive. The first of these relates to Lacan's particular developments of the analysis of the subject and the role of psychoanalysis. The Imaginary forms part of a tripartite system, the other two elements being the Symbolic and the Real (although strictly speaking Lacan initially/historically devised these three as quite separate from one another, and it was only later that they became drawn together). It is worth recapping on these three terms so they are fresh in our minds.</p>
        <p>The Symbolic is that realm dominated by the signifier - of language and culturally constructed organisations and meanings. The Symbolic is, in short, the domain in which we operate in and through 'language' (that is, in the broadest sense, systems of signification, including the chains of signification that come to be seen as meaningful). It is also the area where laws are formulated, repressions enforced, and processes encoded in order that we might share communications and operate as part of a social order. The Real is a little more difficult to define, in part because Lacan tends to be quite evasive in his use of the term, and in part because it is such a slippery concept. For convenience we might think of the Real as operating in much the same way as the unconscious. It exists as a beyond to the Symbolic order, an otherness that continually threatens to break into this cultural structure and disrupt the relationships established. It is designated the 'Real' because unlike the other forces at play here (the Symbolic and the Imaginary) it is, if nothing else, consistently part of the subject's psychic realm and so forms something that might approximate to the 'real'. The Imaginary is not what it might first appear to be - that is, something of the imagination - but rather it is that dominated by the image, and, more importantly, the subject's relationship to the image. The term originates from Lacan's postulations on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">imago</em> and formations of the subject through the image.</p>
        <p>Another way of thinking about these paradigms in terms of film would be to align them with certain processes in the cinematic domain. In this sense the Symbolic would be the large order of systems and structures that allow film to operate as a communicative process, as a culturally recognisable signifying system, and as a point of negotiation shared by members of the social order. The Symbolic film order is that which we most readily recognise, as it plays before our eyes, <em>we</em> talk about it over coffee, and we choose to see it, etc. Within this is the idea of a film's own Symbolic order, which functions in much the same way as the larger Symbolic order (even if it might also be totally oppositional to that order). The Real of film is more difficult to discern because it necessarily includes a diverse set of phenomena. The theories of Metz and Baudry, for example, as they compare the film experience to the dream work, lend themselves to an investigation of the filmic Real. But another way of approaching such a concept would be to consider film's attempt to represent the unconscious. This might include a Surrealist work such as Buiiuel and Dali's <em>Un Chien andalou</em> (1928); or dream sequences such as in Hitchcock's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Spellbound</em> ( 1945); or even films that operate outside of such generic lines or attempts to parallel a dream, such as Greenaway's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Drowning by Numbers</em> (1988) or Lynch's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lost Highway</em> (1987), which have dreamlike qualities to them. In this way the filmic Real is the attempt to represent the Real of the unconscious. Ultimately, however, the Real is that which is missing from the Symbolic and Imaginary - it is the impossible. The filmic Real is, perhaps then, the impossible film yet to be, and never to be, made; or the impossibility of film as it resists the Symbolic. Because it has certain qualities, some (such as Baudry) might argue that film has a particular and unique relationship to the representation of the unconscious, or a manifestation of the Real. The Real, it must be added, even though it is that which is not Symbolic or Imaginary, emerges out of the Symbolic and the Imaginary, as it needs these two other realms to be manifested and recognised. The Imaginary is where the relationship between the spectator and the film is played out, and it is to this that we can now direct our attention.</p>
        <p>As we saw with Metz, this type of Lacanian reading of the relationship of the subject to the image is fundamentally premised on the self-reflexive turn. The Imaginary operates almost entirely in a context of the subject viewing the image in terms of the self, and the self viewing the self in terms of the image. Here we have a very complex set of processes that need to be taken slowly so we might grasp the subtlety of what is being argued by Lacan. The Imaginary is formulated in the mirror stage, as the subject 'discovers', through self-reflexivity, his/her position in the Symbolic world order, and then, consequently, the interplay between individual desires and social constraints. The subject, then, becomes an image for itself, how it positions itselfin the world, and how the world (the Symbolic order) positions it. Here we witness one of Lacan's fundamental premises: that the subject's formation of the self, via the image, is an interaction of the gaze from the subject, and the subject being positioned by the gaze of the Other. It is the big 'O' Other, for this is the realm of otherness which is distinct from the subject, and the little 'o' other, which forms what Lacan terms the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">objet petit a</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a2"><a href="#fn:a2">2</a></sup> - the objects of desire which manifest the realm of Otherness for the subject. In terms of the discussion at hand, it is the gaze itself that becomes both part of the Other and an object of desire for the subject.</p>
        <p>The gaze is seen as a force of power and control, of knowledge and capacity. To possess it is much more than simply having the capacity to see - it is part of the legitimising of the subject to itself and to the Other. To have the gaze is to exist, or, to put it another way, to be recognised by the gaze of the Other is to have a sense of presence. It is not difficult to see why such a scenario might create large ideological problems, and it is one of the counters posited by certain feminist arguments against such a model.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a3"><a href="#fn:a3">3</a></sup> Simply put, these readings suggest that the Other is a masculine identity (in a phallocentric social order) and so any legitimating must always be positioned in terms of a winning of the male gaze. (This is, for example, in some ways, Mulvey's key point in her analysis of the pacification of the female look.) What is important to recognise is that Lacan himself sees this as a significant point in the theory of the gaze; in fact, it is this idea - the power of the gaze of the Other to legitimise and formulate the subject - that stimulates much of his argument. Furthermore, he posits that it is not a gender-specific process, and all subjects are caught in this process of the subject's sense of presence being determined by the Other. But it is far too simple a reading of Lacan to argue that this is a prescriptive model he is suggesting. Lacan wants us to think about what happens to the subject in his/her psychical makeup and social world order when this takes place. As Lacan puts it: 'From the moment that this gaze appears, the subject tries to adapt himself to it, he becomes the punctiform object, that point of vanishing being with which the subject confuses his own failure' (Lacan 1986: 83). Three examples from Lacan will help explain this.</p>
        <p>Lacan tells the story of when, as a young man, he went fishing with a professional fisherman, Petit Jean. The young Lacan - from a different region, and as an academic, a different world in so many ways - felt out of place and wished for a certain recognition. At one point a sardine-can floats by and Petitjean asks: "'You see that can? Do you see it? Well, it doesn't see you!"' Lacan adds: 'He found this incident highly amusing - I less so' (Lacan 1986: 96). Lacan points out that the reason he found it unamusing is that the gaze of the sardine-can cannot see him because he doesn't belong there, he has no right of existence and his very subjectivity is questioned. Film achieves this sardine-can effect in a number of different ways. Watching a film by Spike Lee, for example, directly questions a white viewer's capacity to be seen by the film. That is, it is not simply that a black audience might identify (in Metz's sense) with the film, and a white audience cannot, but rather that the film itself does not recognise and legitimise a white perspective. The gendering of the gaze as being determined as male and heterosexual - what we might term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">phallocularism</em> - is another example. (The counter to this is the situation when the spectator creates his/her own relationship to the film, which leads to a resistant reading practice.) It is important to note that this gaze of the film is not just a prescribed point from which to view the film. It is part of the interaction between the spectator (and his/her social/Symbolic world order), the filmic world order, and the film itself. In this sense it is an encounter with the Real, or what Lacan describes as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tuchi</em>, and so constitutes an emergence of the subject out of the Imaginary's relationship to the Symbolic order and the unconscious.</p>
        <p>A striking aspect of Lacan's story of the sardine-can is the idea that objects, like people, can have a gaze - a point of light that recognises (or fails/refuses to recognise) the subject. The gaze, in this model, does not just simply come from the subject (the spectator of the film), but rather there is a second order of the gaze which emerges from other things (including people, but also objects, films themselves, etc.). Furthermore, this other gaze is what the subject desires, both to be recognised by that gaze and, ultimately, to possess it. It is an impossible desire to satisfy (which is, after all, a requirement of Lacan's definition of desire) so the subject continually posits and encounters the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">objet petit a</em> of the gaze. Such an interpretation does not necessarily lead to the problematics of the powerful phallocentric gaze as being the only one of a legitimate type. The two counter arguments to this are: firstly, the Symbolic order may well set up the phallocular as the desired one, as well as the one to be desired by, but this status requires analysis - which is what Lacan's methodology allows; secondly, it is necessary to recognise the homogenising processes of the phallocular, and its attendant structures of desire, in order to refuse them. Our second example will help illustrate this.</p>
        <p>In a short piece written as a tribute to Marguerite Duras, Lacan sets himself the no small task of interpreting <em class="notranslate" translate="no">le ravissement</em>, which is and isn't quite <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ravishing.</em> The interplay for Lacan is commenced by the very enigma of the word, and its attributes. The story he is dealing with - a short novel by Duras entitled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Ravissement de Lot V. Stein</em> - deals with ravishment, but it constantly raises the question as to who is ravishing and who is being ravished. At one point Lacan admits that part of the process is the ravishing of the reader by Duras and the story. With all these twists and ambiguities of power and powerlessness, Lacan, to describe the subjectivity of Loi (as well as the reader of the text), resorts to what he termsje <em class="notranslate" translate="no">me deux</em> (Lacan 1987: 123), or 'I feel sorrow' as well as, literally, 'I two myself'. This, we shall argue, is also the position that the spectator in film comes to occupy - doubled and ravished by the interplay of gaze and image, subject and desire.</p>
        <p>The particular fascination for us with Duras's story, and Lacan's analysis of it, is that it is heavily invested with acts of looking and constructions of the gaze as power and control.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a4"><a href="#fn:a4">4</a></sup> Lacan, in his essay on this story, reminds us: 'I teach that vision splits between the image and the gaze, and that the first model for the gaze is the stain, from which is derived the radar that the splitting of the eye offers up to the scopic field' (Lacan 1987: 126). This split between eye and gaze is fundamental to the interpretation of the operation of the gaze as a part of the formations of the subject. I tis a split that we shall return to again and again here. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">ravissement</em> is part of the relationship of the spectator and cinema, for it is not just a single gaze towards an image; or even a multiplicity of gazes towards a diffuse collection of images and movements. It is the subject's gaze split through (as well as splitting) the encounter with the image, as it meets the gaze emerging from the film. This is due to many factors, but primary amongst these is the idea of a Symbolic gaze which mediates the subject's own gaze from the Imaginary and the Real. What we see, and how we see it, is determined in the Symbolic by this splitting of the gaze. But there are also forces that emerge from the gaze of the subject which resist and offer counter perspectives to this. Another point from Lacan on this, and then we can resume the analysis of the gaze.</p>
        <p>Lacan takes up the theme of anamorphosis at a number of different points in his seminars, but he does have a common aim in all these discussions. For him anamorphosis represents the self-reflexive moment of the gaze - the moment when we become aware of our own gaze, the gaze of the Other on us, and the effects of this interplay. As Lacan puts it: 'The gaze I encounter ... is, not a seen gaze, but a gaze imagined by me in the field of the Other' (Lacan 1986: 84). His example of anamorphosis is a well-known one - the mysterious floating skull at the feet of the two men in Holbein's painting <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ambassadors.</em> But the point Lacan makes from this is more unusual. For him anamorphosis is the gaze revealed 'in its pulsatile, dazzling and spread out function' (Lacan 1986: 89). The moment of anamorphosis is the moment when this self-reflexive revelation of the function and operation of the gaze takes place.Just as Loi V. Stein replicates the act of looking, so too does anamorphosis present us with the gaze as it both hides and reveals.</p>
        <p>What begins to emerge from a study of Lacan's seminars on the gaze and subjectivity is that there is an interaction between different sets of gazes; and that there is a whole range of distinct, competing orders of the gaze. He speaks, for example, of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">invidia</em> (the envy of the gaze) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dompte-regard</em> (a laying down of the gaze) (Lacan 1986: I 05-19), which are forces that attempt to control and contain the gaze. Once more, it must be reiterated that this is not just a pacification of the gaze, but also part of the construction of subjection and subjectivity. As such, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">invidia</em> is not simply envy or jealousy but the subject's realisation of wholeness in the other who is being watched. This, in cinematic terms, can operate on at least two levels: the spectator of the film has an envy of the image (and so experiences desire for the image); or the film itselfrepresents a character that has this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">invidia.</em> In the previous chapter we saw how, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Manon des sources</em>, Ugolin's mental state became unhinged when he gazed upon the dancing Manon. But this scene, read in terms of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">invidia</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dompte-regard</em>, illustrates the overcoming of the gaze and what happens to subjectivity. From this moment on, Ugolin's social and personal position changes dramatically. Driven by guilt, love, and desire he becomes a non-subject in the eyes of his uncle and, more significantly, himself as well as the village. His once active and all-powerful gaze has been subjected to the 'gaze' from Manon so that it is disempowered - that is, laid down. Curiously, this act of voyeurism, so often seen as a position of power (albeit an insidious and ineffectual one), becomes the very act which disempowers.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a5"><a href="#fn:a5">5</a></sup> This same sort of effect is a recurring motif in film, and examples include: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho</em> (Norman's guilt after spying on Marion); <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Rear Window</em> (Hitchcock 1954) (Jeff's guilt at spying at the people in the opposite apartment); <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em> (Lynch 1986) (the guilt manifested from what amounts to the primal scene when] effery watches Frank and Dorothy). It is perhaps no coincidence that the vast majority of examples are of men looking. This is, in part, a consequence of a certain type of representation of scopophilia, but also a castration fear played out through the challenge to the male gaze.</p>
        <p>In summary, the idea of the gaze and its relationship to the subject operates at a number of levels: it has a positioning effect, in that it prescribes a certain Symbolic site to view the image, as well as developing, through the Imaginary, the subject's sense of the self in relation to the Other and his/ her desires; it has a legitimising effect, in that it recognises certain viewing types (the idea that the male, heterosexual, white gaze position - phallocularism - is the most dominant in Western cinema, for example); it has a desiring effect, as systems of desire are positioned to catch, evoke and stimulate the gaze; it is an interplay of at least two gazing orders – the subject's own gaze, and that which comes from the Other (the sardine-can, the film, the other person, etc.); it is sometimes locked in a self-reflexive moment of the gaze catching the gaze in a reflection - this is one of cinema's primary functions. It is also a process of interaction, with different gaze systems vying for control. The subject is constantly being subjected to gazes which challenge his/her ways of seeing (the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dompte-regard</em> effect), and there are a multiplicity of gazes that are offered and denied (the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">invidia</em>). To understand more fully how these actions work we can now consider some of Lacan's major models of the gaze, and in doing so we can examine the two orders of these theories to film studies: the representation of the gaze in film, and the analysis of the act of watching a film.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Schema of the Inverted Bouquet</h3>
        <p>The schema of the inverted bouquet recurs, in various guises, throughout Lacan's works, but one of the most sustained discussions is to be found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seminar</em> 1: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Freud's Papers on Technique.</em> It is significant that Lacan commences his entire series of seminars with this model of optics, and it is equally significant that this model is Lacan's attempt to engage with the interrelationship between the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real. In keeping with the aims of the discussions and analysis here, we shall not be overly concerned with Lacan's psychoanalytic intrigues and meanderings, but instead look to the relevancy of these ideas for the study of film.</p>
        <p>Lacan's build-up to the inverted bouquet schema involves a discussion on the subject's relationship to the image, and particularly on the interplay between the objective and the subjective. Lacan argues that in the operation of the gaze, 'subjectivity is implicated at every moment' (Lacan l 988a: 77) because the relationship between objectivity and subjectivity is fluid when we look at something. Lacan's real point here is not an attempt to classify the status of things in terms of their objectivity or otherwise, but the insertion of the subject in the scopic drive. In short, we cannot help but position ourselves (or find ourselves positioned) in the act of the gaze. Once this point has been established, Lacan presents the first part of the inverted bouquet (Lacan l 988a: 78).</p>
        <p>What this diagram represents, at least initially, is the curious phenomenon of the spherical mirror. A vase is placed on top of a frame, a bouquet of flowers underneath it, and a spherical mirror is placed near it. The optical trick - the creation of a virtual reality - takes place when the subject looks at the mirror from a certain angle. There appears to be a bouquet of flowers in a vase, and the status of what is real and what is imagined is blurred through the gaze of the subject. Lacan invests this simple experiment with tremendous metaphorical effect; for him it illustrates 'the original adventure through which man, for the first time, has the experience of seeing himself, on reflecting on himself and conceiving of himself as other than he is - an essential dimension of the human, which entirely structures his fantasy life' (Lacan 1988a: 79). Furthermore, it is precisely the gaze - sight - which Lacan insists on as the fundamental component of this development, in both its psychic and cultural dimensions.</p>
        <p>How might we utilise this part of the model in the analysis of film? It is certainly a rich model, and one Lacan exploits to full effect, so the implications for the study of film are wide and diverse. At one level the most apparent application of these ideas is the relationship of the film to reality and the formation of the film signifier. This has been a recurring theme for film studies<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a6"><a href="#fn:a6">6</a></sup> and Lacan's model offers a different perspective on some of these issues. It is the merging of the flowers and the vase to compose a complete image, constituted of elements from what are essentially two different planes of existence. This can also be seen as how the film signifier operates. It combines elements from different planes of existence to form a signifier which exists in, and yet outside of, the world order of objects, subjects, and histories. Lacan's aim is to map out the development of the self-reflexive subject, and the relationships between body and mind. For him, the image of the body is represented by the imaginary vase (Lacan 1988a: 79). For our concerns, that which exists prior to the film forms the missing, imagined elements of what we watch in the film; and what we experience, that which constitutes the two parts into a complete image, is the film signifier - something which is there but not there.</p>
        <p>Lacan's point about the inverted bouquet experiment goes even further, just as the inflection and application of the model given here would seem useful, if somewhat limited, if this was all there was to it. Lacan goes on to discuss the significance of the eye to the vase of flowers and the mirror. He states that in order for this optical illusion to work the eye has to be positioned at a very precise point, and yet this is an eye that roves about. This eye, in short, represents the subject. This is the key to Lacan's model - that is, the formation, and relational contexts, of the unconscious to the social order, and, through such a set of issues, how reality is formulated and maintained in and by the subject, and the relationship of this to the body. As Lacan puts it: 'in the relation of the Imaginary and the Real, and in the constitution of the world such as results from it, everything depends on the position of the subject. And the position of the subject ... is essentially characterised by its place in the Symbolic world' (Lacan 1988a: 80). Here, then, we find the continuing negotiations between the film, and its signifying practices, and the spectator as he/she moves in and out of the positioned viewing site. However, this model illustrates something which has even greater application to the study of film when Lacan adds a second mirror (see Lacan 1988a: 124).</p>
        <p>This is how Lacan describes the set-up of his experiment: 'if one put a mirror in the middle of the room, while I turn my back on the concave mirror, I would see the image of the vase as clearly as if I were at the end of the room, even though I wouldn't see it in a direct manner. What am I going to <em>see</em> in the mirror? Firstly, my own face, there where it isn't. Secondly, at a point symmetrical to the point where the real image is, I am going to see this real image appear as a virtual image' (Lacan l 988a: 125). This schema illustrates the subject's relationship to its fascination with the selfas itis determined by the gaze of the Other, which necessarily includes desire, and the continuing question of the lack of wholeness of the self. For our concerns here, however, it is when Lacan adds an extra dimension that the model has a number of points in the relationship of the spectator to the cinema.</p>
        <p>Here Lacan has added what he calls the virtual subject (VS), which is the image that confronts us as we negotiate the fragmented nature of our subjectivity in the world.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a7"><a href="#fn:a7">7</a></sup> This virtual subject becomes a representation of the subject, for the subject. As Lacan puts it: 'The human being only sees his form materialised, whole, the mirage of himself, outside of himself' (Lacan 1988a: 140). Here we have the beginnings of a model to explain the spectator's insertion of him/herself into the cinematic signifier. In doing so there is a creative act through the interplay between the gaze from the subject, the gaze from the film's signifiers, and the projection of this subject as a virtual subject which exists within the film. This virtual subject cannot simply be an identification with a character in the film, just as it cannot simply be the projection of the self (as in, say, daydreaming) into the film. This is an entirely different order that exists at another level in the text and from the spectator. It is this because it works at both a conscious and unconscious level, and plays out the acts of desire through the film. To illustrate this better, Figure 2.1 rereads Lacan's model in terms of the spectator, the film and its signifiers. We can rename Lacan's elements to better understand how they explicate the relationships between the spectator and film. The divided elements of the vase and flowers correspond to the raw material of film itself, that is, the objects and actors filmed, lighting, setting, etc. The conventions of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (including genre, narrative structures, systems of editing, musical structures, in short all those systems we utilise to make sense of the film, and the film uses to render itself as recognisable) are represented by the concave mirror. This is the point where the raw material is drawn together and fashioned into 'narrative', 'documentary', 'comedy', etc. It is also where conventions of systems such as horror or the erotics of the image are formulated; which means less the actual quality of such things, and more the cultural and textual conventions that allow them to be recognised. It suits our rereading that this concave mirror exists 'prior' to the subject, as these are the focal points which allow a reading to take place, and the spectator may or may not <em>be</em> aware of the action of this mirror in bringing elements together and projecting them out as a film. The spectator of the film is represented by the eye, and is thus positioned close to, but quite separated from, the elements of the raw material. In Lacan's model he points out that the subject is close to the 'real image' but sees it as a virtual one, which is parallel to what is being suggested here. The real image of the objects, settings and actors exists on the same ontological plane as the reader (compared to the fictional world), but remains distant from him/her. The film that we watch is formed on the plane mirror, which here represents the cinematic apparatus,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a8"><a href="#fn:a8">8</a></sup> and brings the elements of the concave mirror, the spectator, the filmed real objects, and the processes of ideology (as part of the cinematic apparatus) together. And beyond all this is the virtual subject, which represents the spectator's relationship to this mirage of completeness.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, this relationship between the composed image (the cinematic signifier, the film itself, the bouquet of flowers in a vase) and the spectator, as formulated in the virtual subject, is a formation premised on a merging of elements from the subject's own sense of self (the Imaginary) and the drives and desires of the subject's unconscious (the Real). Lacan represents this particular aspect in the psychic apparatus by changing the plane mirror into a pane of glass (Lacan 1988a: 141). For our model of the cinema, such a change works equally well, for the pane of glass reflects the image for the spectator's view, allows the gaze to go beyond it to observe a further object (or have a sense of'depth' about the object - its history beyond the text's narrative, etc.), and allows a glimpse of the spectator watching him/herself in the act of gazing. The motivating processes in this schema are primarily two fold: there is the seductive process of selfreflection - that is, when we engage in this act of looking we are inevitably drawn into a sense of the self watching the self; there are also the forces of desire. If desire is both inescapable and beyond satisfaction, this act of constructing the virtual subject, 'inside' a domain of complete and whole objects, presents a playing out of a mirage of satisfied desires. This is not simply a model of people watching films and having their desires acted out for them. Rather, it is an explication of desire itself, the formation of a whole different sense of the self, and cinema's role in these processes.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinematic Excess and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Differance</em> of Cinema</h3>
        <p>So far we have been primarily concerned with ideas that deal with the spectator's relationship to the film in order to better understand what happens when we watch a film, and offer some ideas about why the cinematic image is so compelling. The discussion will now turn to the idea that within these processes there is always a beyond to the experience of the film itself and the spec ta ting act. In one sense this beyondness has already been introduced through the figure of the virtual subject, and this can be brought to bearlater on. It has also been touched on in terms of the filmic Real, that is, the impossibility of a systemics of a filmic order. For the moment the central focus will be on what we will term cinematic excess, and to discuss this we will turn to some ideas from Derrida, commencing with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em> and the supplement.</p>
        <p>Although <em>we</em> need not concern ourselves with too many details here, it is important to recognise a general strategy of Derrida's deconstructionalist approach. Derrida, the philosopher, is interested in taking apart the underlying assumptions and concepts of Western thought. He sets himself the complex task of unravelling what it is we do when we think about things, knowing that so much of how we think (solve problems, recognise enigmas, produce answers, take mental short cuts, etc.) is already in existence for us. It is a project that reaches back some time, most clearly to Nietzsche and then through phenomenology to what is now loosely called deconstruction. One set of issues that Derrida deals with (in different forms, but with recurring motifs) is the idea of wholeness and completeness. In doing so, Derrida challenges some of the key ideas of Western thought - ideas such as the centrality of presence over absence, and formations of notions such as 'Truth', 'Meaning', 'Logos', etc. To deconstruct these he devises analysis based on the denied - absence, the supplement, and excess.</p>
        <p>One of these strategies is Derrida's neologism <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em>, which refers to the idea that the construction of meaning is something that is not fixed and finite, but rather an action of continual deferral and difference. Meanings, he argues, are never really arrived at, but are premised on a multiplicity of possible meanings (the act of difference) and non-arrival (the act of deferral). As we watch a film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em> operates at a number of levels. We continually propose possibilities of actions, sequences, and meanings, abandoning some and creating others as the narrative progresses. We also 'arrive' at smaller, more fragile, meanings, whilst deferring others so that there is an interplay between the actual and the possible. All of this, in itself, is akin to what we have already witnessed in terms of the spectator's actions of constructing (and co-constructing) the film itself. Where something like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em> is distinct is that the process fundamentally undercuts the larger orders of 'Meaning' and acts of interpretation, so that they become almost impossible to determine with confidence, except in a kind of socially acceptable act. In this sense, to speak of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em> is to speak of a problematising of the cornerstones of Western thought. Of particular significance, especially within this context of film, is the investment Derrida makes in terms of space and time.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Diffirance</em> is conceptually based in issues of spatiality and temporality. Consider this description from Derrida: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">'Diffirance</em> is what makes the movement of signification possible only if each element that is said to be "present", appearing on the stage of presence, is related to something other than itself but retains the mark of a past element and already lets itself be hollowed out by the mark of its relation to a future element' (Derrida 1973: 142). This notion of the temporal is important to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em> because it signals the dynamic nature of formulating meanings and interpretations. <em>As</em> Derrida indicates in the above statement, signification can only take place if there is a sense of presence, connected to what has already gone before and the almost limitless possibilities of what may follow.</p>
        <p>These limitless possibilities are, of course, limited in a number of ways. If they were not, the act of watching a film, before even making sense of it, would be an impossibility. Genre is one example of how limitations are applied to the act of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">differance.</em> Our knowledge of the conventions of a generic form allows us to make certain decisions about the deferred possibilities, and to limit the paradigmatic range. The demise of Cody Jarrett in Raoul Walsh's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">White Heat</em> (1949) is pretty much a predetermined element of the film. Audiences had learnt to expect the legal (and moral) punishment of the gangster, so his death in the final scene operates quite within a deferred moment that has been expected. However, where we might see aspects of <em>diffirance</em> here is the way in which he dies, and the undercutting of the morality of such a death. Cody's death is framed triumphantly, an expression of escape and victory - even if it is uttered from a character presented as criminally insane. Compare the deaths in two gangster films made with a more reflexive eye, and this idea of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dijferance</em> becomes even more evident. In Arthur Penn's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bonnie and Clyde</em> (1967) the portrayal of the death of the two characters is more graphic in terms of violence, yet more sympathetic than the long-distance shot of Cody Jarrett blowing up. This sympathetic view is even more clearly demonstrated in Coppola's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Godfather</em> ( 1972), when Don Corleone actually dies in the idyllic surrounds of a sunlit garden, playing with his grandson. There is no shower of bullets or purgatorial fires, simply age and 'natural causes', so he escapes any moral retribution or legal capture.</p>
        <p>In all three films there is an observance of the conventions of the gangster genre which insist on the death of the criminals, but the spectator must still defer this death scene, because in each case there is difference - and a difference that alters the whole moral, emotive and diegetic calibre of the scene. In each case, the representation of the death of the gangster provides <em class="notranslate" translate="no">differance</em> through and against the generic conventions. An example of this as it orders an entire film is the Coen Brothers' <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miller's Crossing</em> (1990). The conventions of the gangster film are continually foregrounded in this film, reminding the spectator that they are watching a gangster film about gangster films. The very opening scene declares this, asJ ohnny Caspar delivers his speech on the ethical dilemmas being posed by territorial infringements and sporadic violence. Gangster films always have this sense of the ethics of violence and pay-back, but rarely is it articulated so directly - and straight at the camera. Vendettas, revenge, violence against violence, are a key part of the code of such films, driving the narrative and providing motivation for characters' actions. But we do not expect an opening speech on precisely this issue. From this point on, the death of the gangster, and in particular Tom, becomes a point of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">dijferance.</em> Tom's death is always possible, with the strange metaphor of Miller's Crossing standing in for that moment of violence. It is strange because gangster films are, almost by necessity, urban films, with urban violence (drive-by shootings, murderous back alleyways, crumbling buildings, etc.). True to this form, all the violence in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miller's Crossing</em> takes place in an urban setting. Yet it is the sepia-infused rustic scene with the profusion of trees (with considerable pans and cuts to the tops of them) and winding paths covered in leaves that offers the greatest threat to Tom. It is here that he seems destined to meet the violent fate of the gangster.</p>
        <p>But the film also undercuts precisely this impending threat by deferring many of the gangster traits of Tom. Caspar's opening speech of ethics is directed, in many ways, at himself, but it is really a summation of Tom's position. He is the gangster without a gun (for most of the time), whose status seems invested more in his hat than any weapon. And he is continually cast as the voice against violence. He is certainly not an upholder of the social order of law, but he does have a clear sense of morality and ethics. He becomes an embodiment of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">differance</em> of all the conventions of gangster films, and yet he is continually positioned within a profusion of them. The dress, actions, speech, and events of the film declare 'gangsterness', only its main character defers and differs them. This <em>differance</em> makes sense if we think of it in terms of Derrida's point on the movement of signification. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">idea</em> of Tom's death (even though it never eventuates) originates prior to his existence because it is embedded in the codes of the gangster genre, and thus it retains the mark of past elements (that is, the paradigm of gangster films). Its possibility is 'hollowed out by the mark of its relation to a future element', that is, Tom's violent death is constantly deferred, but never diminished as a possible (perhaps probable) event. And all of this takes place in the relationship of the spectator to the film, as he/she constructs signification and interpretation through deferring the meanings and producing different ones.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dangerous Supplements and Cinema</h3>
        <p>Another way of looking at this process is through Derrida's idea of the supplement. For Derrida, the concept of the supplement, the very idea of supplementarity, suffers badly in the hands of the philosophers of the Enlightenment. From their perspective (Rousseau is one of Derrida's prime examples), that which is supplementary is seen as marginal, an addition to the centre or origin; it is something that is of lesser significance. It is what Rousseau calls the dangerous supplement, describing it as that which 'adds itself from the outside as evil and lack to happy and innocent plenitude' (Rousseau in Derrida 1976: 215), which is why it is so dangerous. The supplement, in such an interpretation, contaminates the whole and complete world order, bringing to it excess and imbalance. It is premised on the conviction that there can exist completion and wholeness. Derrida reinterprets the status of the supplement (his prime example in his book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Grammatology</em>, is writing as the supplement to speech), and in doing so challenges many of the constructs of Western metaphysics, such as truth, centre, knowledge - in short, the ways in which we think, and the systems which are developed to produce such thoughts.</p>
        <p>For Derrida, there can be no origin to which supplements are attached, because everything is a supplement to another supplement. The idea of a centre is a privileging construction, just as the supplement is defined as other and lack. This is part of the dynamics of generating meaning, of representational systems, of categorising and ordering. To quote from Derrida's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Writing and Difference:</em> 'One could say ... that this movement of play, permitted by the lack or absence of a centre or origin, is the movement of supplementarity. One cannot determine the centre and exhaust totalisation because the sign which replaces the centre, which supplements it, takes the centre's place in its absence - this sign is added, occurs as a surplus, as a supplement' (Derrida 1978: 289). This is what we might call the chain of supplementarity, or the unending roll of references and connections to other supplements, none ever claiming or holding the status of centre or origin. As Derrida puts it: 'The supplement is always the supplement of a supplement. One wishes to go back from the supplement to the source: one must recognise that there is a supplement at the source' (Derrida 1976: 304). In terms of theoretical models, this idea has been expressed (in various guises) in areas such as postcolonialism (the denial of the colonial power as a centre or origin of the production of the colonised culture) and feminism (woman as the supplement to the originary male) to deconstruct the fundamental paradigms of thought and knowledge.</p>
        <p>One of Derrida's key points is that the positioning of the supplement, as addition and as lesser than the centre or origin, means that anything defined as such will carry with it such supposed qualities. So, it is the investment of presence over absence, of the originary over that which follows. Our concern here is not the status of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as such (which has had acertain attribute of the supplement placed on it), but how we might employ this idea of the supplement in the analysis of film itself. We can begin by teasing out a few of the key ideas from Derrida's investigations, focusing on two permutations: the representation of supplementarity (that is, the supplement as theme); and the ways in which the supplement might be figured as a critical concept in film studies.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em>Representing the Supplement</em></h3>
        <p>To understand how the representation of the supplement can be seen to be operating in film we can select a few of the key ideas on what constitutes this supplementary status. In doing so it will be possible to examine how film engages in different ways of representing the supplementary element, and how this quality of the supplement is created, and possibly sustained. These key ideas will include: the notion of the natural (and evil); the excess of the supplementary agent and its disruptive qualities; the function of the substitution; and the questioning of the origin. We will also be concerned with the ways in which some <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has actually celebrated the supplement over the origin, and how this has impacted on the development of cinematic styles as well as content. To illustrate these ideas we will take one of the foundational models of the supplement in phallocentric culture, that of woman, and in particular the form of the vampire. This example ties in particularly well with the idea of the supplement because the socalled centre of such supplements operates both culturally (the phallocentric, morally defined 'good', the balance of society, the natural) and textually (the vampire film is a well-established form with quite clearly defined conventions). Rather than attempt a history of this representation (a project beyond the direct concerns here), we will be more interested in examining the construction and alteration of the female vampire as supplement through a number of film examples.</p>
        <p>One of the defining qualities of the supplement is its capacity to corrupt what has been interpreted to be a site of wholeness and order, and in doing so it is seen as a direct challenge to perceived notions of the authentic. To refer once more to Derrida's citations of Rousseau in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Grammatology:</em> 'In it [the supplement] everything is brought together ... regression toward an evil that is not natural and that adheres to the power of substitution' (Derrida 1976: 147). Derrida's (philosophically orientated) point is that this is precisely how Western metaphysics works in sustaining ideas on, say, truth, when they are really just constructions. (This can be seen as an indirect reference to Nietzsche's famous dictum that truth is a metaphor that has forgotten its status.) In terms of the female vampire there is a double supplement, both of which inflect it towards this sense of an unnatural evil. There is the woman as supplement to man, and the vampire as supplement to humanity. A third supplement, derived in part from these two is the lesbian vampire, which acts as a supplement to heterosexuality.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a9"><a href="#fn:a9">9</a></sup> So the female has it all in terms of a supplementary positioning; she is denied the centres and originary functions of masculinity, morality and 'normal' sexuality. Of course this is precisely what gives such a figure this powerful, seductive and compelling representation. In much the same way as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">femme fatale of film noir</em> is both supplement through, and site of, dangerous desire, the lesbian vampire is both abject and alluring - an absence and a presence at the same point in time. These representations of women are constructions of the phallocentric order that excludes them as supplements, and yet continually returns to them. They are also logical extensions of the ways in which phallocentrism constructs women overall - the feminine is the supplement to the masculine in the patriarchal order.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a10"><a href="#fn:a10">10</a></sup></p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that this theme of the lesbian vampire and the lure of the supplement fits into the larger representation of lesbianism as part of a culturally acknowledged phallocentric fantasy. It does raise the question as to why such seemingly (male) excluding scenarios are positioned as recurring (and almost universal) masculine fantasies. There are many possible answers but the one that is to be posed here is that this representation oflesbianism as male fantasy operates as a hegemonic process. By drawing what would appear to be a threatening scene (women's pleasure as a beyond to the masculine; the lack of the male figure; the satisfaction and unity of the lesbian couple in their sexuality, the threat of castration through the lack of the phallus, etc.) into the controlling order of masculine sexuality, there is a hegemonic disempowering of lesbianism as a challenge to masculine centrality. Such an interpretation means that rather than attempting to deny or exclude lesbianism, phallocentrism instead locates it within its controlling domain, designating it as part of the 'acceptable' male sexual fantasies. In this sense it can <em>be</em> accommodated into the phallocularism rather than resisting it. Interestingly, the same process does not appear to have operated in the same fashion with male homosexuality, where for a long time repression through absence or linking it to mental disorder has dominated representations. Lesbianism, however, operates as a supplement even within this sense of male sexual fantasies.</p>
        <p>Our first example of this representation of the supplement is one where there is a clear sense of the unnatural evil and the power of substitution. It is drawn from that period in film history that witnessed the production of a large number of horror films by the Hammer studios in the late 1960s into the 1970s. On the surface these were horror films, but their mixture of sex and nudity with horror themes were thinly disguised attempts to circumvent the repressive censorship laws and codes of the time. There is still the strong moral code running through these films, with all transgressions, especially the sexual, being punished and a return to the phallocentric social order. The recurring representation of women in these films ties in with the long tradition of hysteria, borrowing extensively from late nineteenth-century thought. Witchcraft (in this case the figure of the witch is transposed onto the vampire) and hysteria ran parallel, with women being seen as especially vulnerable to seduction towards evil. It is noteworthy that the social interpretation of an association between witchcraft and mental illness occurs at the same time Rousseau is theorising the dangers of the supplement.</p>
        <p>A cycle of films made in the mid to late 1970s, based on the short story 'Camilla' by Sheridan Le Fanu, consistently presented the lesbian vampire as powe:rful, passionate, and quite irresistible. Given that these films were never particularly underground (they were popular, mainstream films, even ifthe audience tended to be almost subcultural) or revolutionary in their sexual politics, the question arises as to how we might read this figure in terms of the supplement. One the one hand these representations are part of a general phallocentric fantasy of lesbian eroticism. It is perhaps not enough to attribute to the lesbian vampire figure the qualities of the forbidden, or a projected male intervention, to explain this recurring phenomenon. What is needed is an examination of how such a supplement works for and against the phallocularism of such mainstream films, which will also allow us to consider how effective the hegemonic processes actually are.</p>
        <p>Mircalla/Camilla, the female vampire in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Vampire Lovers</em> (Roy Ward Baker 1971), represents the supplement in a number of ways. She is immediately positioned as an outsider who comes into the girls' school. Her sexual encounter with Laura Spielsdorf, her roommate, is presented variously as forbidden (the scene where the two are caught semi-naked by the teacher prompts a quick cover-up and awkward glances), sensual (the kiss in the lake), and ultimately destructive. In such terms the existence of Mircalla would seem to be the evil and dangerous supplement that disrupts the lives of the women and the social order of the school. However, the parallel romantic couple, Roger Morton and the school teacher, which is presented as a sustainable relationship, is one of restraint and repression. Where the supplementary desires of Mircalla are allowed freedom (with consequences of death), the heterosexual couple is bound to censorship. At one point the teacher almost succumbs to the advances of Mircalla but, as is so often the case in these films, the masculine intervention prevents this. This is the lesbian vampire as dangerous supplement to the masculine world order, the 'always open possibility of a catastrophic regression and the annulment of progress' (Derrida 1976: 298), with both 'regression' and 'progress' being very much determined through the phallocentric domain. Even in those films where the masculine intervention seems to be ineffectual in preventing the dangerous supplement, we still find certain prohibitions and curtailment. There are films that appear to escape this, although there is usually a scene of punishment for the supplementary (vampiric) force. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Daughters of Darkness</em> (Kumel 1971), for example, retains the death of the lesbian vampires, but closes with a metaphoric reincarnation of one of them in the body of another woman. Whether this amounts to transgression, or simply a cycle of supplement and punishment, raises another set of issues.</p>
        <p>Derrida's desire to recoup the supplement, or at least to read it beyond the constrictions of the dominant interpretations, leads him at one point to argue that all that the Enlightenment attributes to the supplement is also what gives it its power. This is the supplement's capacity to resist and invert. It is the quality of the supplement to be an excess and an outside to the social order. As Derrida says: 'Thus supplementarity makes possible all that constitutes the property of man: speech, society, passion ... supplementarity, which is nothing, neither a presence nor an absence, is neither a substance nor an essence of man. It is precisely the play of presence and absence, the opening of this play that no metaphysical or ontological concept can comprehend' (Derrida 1976: 244). This is equally applicable to the lesbian vampire, for she is beyond the systems of rational thought constructed within the social (religious/metaphysical) world order. There is little difference in whether or not such figures are ultimately punished (as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Vampire Lovers)</em> or whether they appear to escape (as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Daughters of Darkness</em> or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blood and Roses</em> (Vadim 1960)), their presence continually acts as a type of representation of the dangerous supplement, allowing both interpretations to take place.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em>The Filmic Supplement</em></h3>
        <p>In this section we will be concerned with the idea of the filmic supplement, that is, some of the ways in which film constructs a particular type of supplement unique to itself, and how various aspects of film utilise these supplementary values and structures. This is the idea that, rather than just representing the supplement (as dangerous or otherwise), film actually incorporates it into its own textual formations and operations. Clearly the documentation of the whole of cinematic supplementarity is too large a project to detail here, so a few examples will serve to illustrate how such an idea might be approached.</p>
        <p>For a considerable part of the early years of film and its theories, montage and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> were positioned as antithetical both in terms of the construction of film and the overall effect on (and relationship to) the spectator. The domination of early film theory by Arnheim (for expressionism) and Kracauer (for realism<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a11"><a href="#fn:a11">11</a></sup>) fed this division; as did cinematic practices by people such as Griffith and Eisenstein (privileging montage) and Welles (privileging <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em>, especially in, for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane</em> ( 1941)). Basically this was a theorising, and practice, based on constructing realism to have an effect on the viewer. Depending on which theory and practice one subscribed to, the realism of the film (its construction as well as its mental/emotive effects) was better served by montage or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en scene;</em> and any intervention by the other was seen as a dismantling of the desired synthesis.</p>
        <p>So, following on from this tradition, something like Bazin's theories illustrate how montage has been positioned as a type of supplement to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> in the production of realism. Taking our lead once more from Derrida we witness a similarity in how the issues of verisimilitude and imitation are defined in the discourse of the supplement. Derrida deconstructs Rousseau's denouncement of mimesis and art as supplements to reality/realism, premised as they are on a sense of the authentic and immediate. Bazin's insistence on the realism of film, and in particular the spatial properties, means that so much of his theory has nowhere to go. When he declares, for example, that cinema's realism is 'not certainly the realism of subject matter or realism of expression, but the realism of space' (Bazin 1967: 112) then it follows that so much must be invested in a theory of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene.</em> Thus montage becomes a supplement to depth of field in Bazin's theories because of this investment in realism.</p>
        <p>It was Godard who can be seen to have developed a way out of this sense of montage as supplement to <em>mise-en-scene.</em> In his theoretical writings (see, for example, his essay <em class="notranslate" translate="no">'Montage, mon beau souci'</em> in Hillier 1986), and throughout many of his films, Godard demonstrated a type of deconstruction of the impasse that had existed in this realist/expressionist-montage/mise-en-scene debate. Godard worked in terms of montage and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> operating together, so that neither could be attributed as supplement of the other. There are many examples of this in Godard's work, but one of the most interesting (and self-reflexive) is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Passion</em> ( 1982). Here Godard plays with a theorising of composition through the devising of elaborate reconstructions of famous paintings. This becomes a treatise on the difficulties of a stable <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> as elements keep breaking up within the scene itself. At one point in the attempt to replicate Delacroix's <em>Crusader's Entry Into Constantinople</em>, two women constantly run about the set, resisting composure and stillness. They become dangerous supplements to the very act of cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene.</em> This is something we see again in Godard's short film 'Armide' (included in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aria</em> (1987)), with the fluid movement of the two women around the sharply composed figures of the weight-lifters.</p>
        <p>The contrast to this deconstruction of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> (which is not its negation of course) in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Passion</em>, are the typically Godardian jump-cuts that emphasise - and equally deconstruct - montage. This scene of the Delacroix painting does, at the final moments, reinvest a power to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> with a formation of the image almost without cuts and pushing depth as an integral part of the cinematic apparatus (the lowering of the women on the platform into the frame is particularly noteworthy for this). This comes after there seems to have been a type of supplementarity attached to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em> composition as part of the narrative processes. Immediately following this scene, however, is a jump-cut to a closeup of a car headlight, and then into a factory. The contrast is as sharp and disruptive as the two women are to the breakdown of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene.</em> Each function as dangerous supplements, but both are rich, and work, in Derrida's terms, outside of presence and absence.</p>
        <p>We have gone a long way from the starting point of this chapter - that of the relationship of the viewer to the image - yet so much of the material discussed in this second half is invested in a similar set of issues. After all, from the early theorists, through Bazin and then on to the New Wave, the issues of the realism of the image, the processes of montage and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scene</em>, and the synthesis of ideas we find in the works of people such as Godard, all revolve around the fundamental relationship of image and spectator. Bazin's assertion, for example, on the realism of space has strong connections to Brecht's ideas on realism as an ideological construct; this, in turn, is about the spectator's relationship to the 'realisms' of the image, and how they operate. If we were to extend the discussion of the supplement even further, it would be possible to argue that the film and the spectator operate in a Derridean sense of the supplement, each positioning the other as a supplement to itself. Seen in this way, the act of watching a film is very much about how we formulate relationships of meaning and subjectivity. This is an idea that will be continued in the following chapter on discourse.</p>

            <li id="fn:a7">For psychoanalysis - particularly Freudian and Lacanian - the subject is a fragmented and divided subject. This split starts at the mirror stage, but continues throughout the subject's life. The splits include those from the Symbolic order, within himself/herself through the division of the ego, id and super-ego, and the repression of the unconscious drives and desires.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a7">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a8">This term carries with it a great deal of critical currency, particularly in terms of the writings ofBaudry. We will consider it in more detail in a later section, but its meaning here, and throughout, is the formation and operation of the <em>cinematic</em> itself.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a8">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a9">9. It is noteworthy that recent critical writings in Queer Theory took as one of their starting points the representation of the vampire; see, for example, Sue-Ellen Case's essay 'Tracking the Vampire' (1991).<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a9">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a10">Later it will be important to consider some of the points made by Lacan on the supplement and the feminine.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a10">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a11">To extend this discussion even further, in Kracauer's schema anything that did not contribute to the effect of realism would be seen as a supplement -and a dangerous one at that! Kracauer's theories are founded on the idea that it is the photography which forms the underlying material of film. Once more, we see that in much of his (somewhat extreme) theory everything else in film - including editing - is a supplement to the realism of the photographic image.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a11">↩</a></li>
