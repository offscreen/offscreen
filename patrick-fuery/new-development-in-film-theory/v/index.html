        <p>When we ask the question '<span class="notranslate" translate="no">What is cinema?</span>', one initial response is that it isthe experience of watching a film. But even so simple a response evokes aseemingly unending roll of questions. What, for example, is consideredpart of this experience? (just the watching? or the conversations afterwards?is remembering a film part of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> tic experience? are the emotionalresponses to a film part of cinema? is it the entire film, or just parts of it? etc.); what is it to watch? (what are the pluralities of spectatorshipsinvolved across audiences, and even within the individual who watches thesame film more than once?); does watching a film mean something differentfrom watching other things, and if so what are the differences and how arethey formed? How much a part of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> are cultural contexts? or individualhistories? or the force of the images? And each of these such questionselicits even more questions. In part, just recognising such issues formulates <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself. The capacity of film, and its theories, to actually provoke aquestioning of what it does, and how it does this, and how we recognise it,all forms part of the cinematic experience. The aim in positing, and considering,such questions is not necessarily to resolve them, or even to movetowards a sort of eidetic reduction of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (to grasp 'cinemaness' as thephenomenologists might say), but we do gain a great deal in foregroundingthem. Part of the aim of this chapter, and the following one, is to considerwhat <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is (and what it does, and what we do to it) by working throughsome ideas on discourse. By this is meant that we can consider cinemathrough its discourses, and how ideas on discourse can be applied to cinema.</p>
        <p>We will be primarily concerned with two configurations of discourse inthis chapter. The first is that of how semiotics attempts to analyse filmicdiscourse through an interaction between structures, systems, and culturalcontexts. This follows a strong textual tradition found in semiotic studies.The second reading of discourse will be derived from some of the ideasof Michel Foucault, in particular the relationship between power and discourse, and the constructions of meaning through discourse. These twodifferent approaches to the idea of discourse (the textual/cultural of semioticsand the power/knowledge of Foucault) will allow us to gain a differentperspective on how film itself operates as a discursive practice.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Semiotics and Discourse</h3>
        <p>A great deal of work exists on semiotic approaches to film<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup> so we will not beoverly concerned with sketching out all the basics of this theory here.It is important to recognise that what this analytic model provides is a wayof understanding not simply <em>what</em> something means, but <em>how</em> meanings areproduced, sustained, negotiated and devised. This is one of the major legaciesof poststructuralism's contribution to semiotics. By challenging thenotion that meaning production is a fixed and potentially finite system,thinkers as diverse as Umberto Eco, Derrida, Julia Kristeva, Barthes, andLacan reorientated semiotics to become a system of questioning ratherthan just providing resolution. No longer was there an emphasis on thepursuit of the signified - analysis at the level of constructed meaning -and more deliberation was placed on the production and operation of thesignifier, and the dynamics and slippage between the two. It was the pluralismof meaning that defined the direction of the theorising, rather thanany sense of closure. The semiotic analysis looked at the ways in whichsigns function and interact in the unlimited production and play of meanings.Furthermore, in this interpretation of the production of meanings,semiotics attempted to examine the relationship of this to cultural, historical,and readerly contexts.</p>
        <p>It is well known that one of the initial conundrums of film semiotics wasits attempt to investigate the idea of a film language. Various theoristsdeliberated on whether or not there was a language; and if there was, howdo we recognise it and read it; and how does it compare to other languages.We only have to have a casual glance at any of Metz's earlier works to seehow complex such questions are, and how much they shaped this approachto film studies. What is also of significance in these terms is that many of the other key developments in film theory were tackling the same sortsof questions, but with different inflections. Psychoanalysis was, in itself,concerned with the idea of language and the psychic apparatus (leadingto Lacan's famous 'The unconscious is structured like a language'<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a2"><a href="#fn:a2">2</a></sup>); feminismwas examining the relationships between language and gender, aswell as developing different signifying practices (such as <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Hi:li:ne Cixous'</span><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bcriture feminine</em> and Luce Irigaray's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parler femme);</em> deconstruction was tackling logocentrism as a problem of Western thought and systems of meaning, etc. One of the effects of this was that when any of these theoreticalparadigms came together, there was often a continuing and sustainedexamination of the idea oflanguage itself, its constitutive elements as wellas its operations and structures.</p>
        <p>Metz's desire to construct a theory of film language produced somehighly influential ideas and much of the shape of film semiotics is derivedfrom his work. There are, however, a number of questionable propositionsin the ideas and often it is at these points of theoretical discomfort that wefind a need for further elaboration and/or the intervention of different perspectives.This is especially the case for our concerns with filmic discourse.For example, one of his qualifications regarding the existence of a cinematiclanguage system is that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> lacks true communication (as distinctfrom its signifying practices). In some ways this is a logical enoughidea - Metz argues that film cannot communicate (like speech) becauseit is invested in expression rather than communication. This idea becomesmore problematic, however, when we consider ideas from other semioticperspectives (such as Eco and Barthes), which have a greater emphasis onthe role of the reader. From these other critical positions it is more difficultto argue the line that 'one does not respond to a film with another film producedat that instant' (Metz 1976: 584) because, in some ways, this is oftenwhat takes place. The activity of reading/spectating involves intertexualconnections (see below) so we are continually responding to a film througha variety of other films. Even the very act of going to the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> immediatelylinks us to a coded practice of the film form. In such an example wewitness how the developments in film semiotics have attributed greaterforce to the reader's construction of the film (and language) itself. This is,of course, not a failure to recognise the literalness of Metz's idea (film,unlike spoken language, is not an immediate statement-response process),but even this does not negate the idea that films are experienced withincontexts of other films.</p>
        <p>Another way in which we might tackle this idea of the reading of film,the orders oflanguage, and the signifying practices, is through theories of discourse. This will allow us to continue to work through this idea of theinterplay between the spectator and the elements of film in the constructionof a cinematic language and discourse. Ultimately we will be concernedwith defining discourse through the ideas and themes of Foucault,but for the moment it is worthwhile considering a specific example to seehow a general notion of discourse and semiotics might be enfolded. Theexample is intertextuality, largely because it will allow us to map out certainpoints of connection and development between semiotics and discoursein both theoretical concerns and film examples.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Intertextuality</h3>
        <p>There have developed two large orders of'interpretations' of intertextuality. The first is what we might most readily recognise - an interweaving of texts as they refer to each other, either specifically or through a generalsense of connection. The second is a more semiotically driven version, mostnotably found in the works of Kristeva and, to a lesser extent, Derrida. It isuseful to take these two orders separately so that we might consider boththeir differences and points of similarity. There are a number of ways inwhich films can construct intertextuality (and this necessarily includesboth the text as intertextual source and the spectator's intertextual constructions).The four that we will concentrate on here are derived from acritical sensibility which includes both the traditional sense of texts referringto other texts, as well as Kristeva's innovations and reworkings. Theseinclude: (I) structural reference; (2) thematic reference; (3) synecdochicstructures; (4) mosaic formations. Even though most of these overlap inone way or another, we will take each of them separately to begin with.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Structural Reference</em></h3>
        <p>Films can structurally refer, or be connected, to other films in a number of ways. In one sense genre almost inevitably establishes and relies on a typeof structural intertextuality as films observe the conventions of the form.Of course just because a film is located within a specific genre does notnecessarily mean that it has some form of intertextuality. There is no realreferential sense in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Man Who Shot Liber!J! Valance</em> (Ford 1963) to, for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon</em> (Zinneman 1953), and it would be a difficult line toargue for intertextual connections between the two just because they areboth Westerns and deal with certain themes and styles in a particular Hollywoodfashion. So how is it possible to argue that Raimi's Western <em class="notranslate" translate="no">TheQuick and the Dead</em> (1995) can be seen to have an intertextual reference to<em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon?</em> Curiously, intertextuality cannot simply be seen as a straightforwardtextual strategy, even though this is what it sounds like. One of thefactors which allows an intertextual reference to operate is the diachronicsof the films. There is a specific place (Hollywood) and time (1940s throughto the early 1960s as an indicator of the 'classic' period) when the genreof the Western film was made and formulated. Films made outside of thesetwo factors of place and time (in Italy or Spain, or in the 1980s and 1990s)are almost necessarily positioned as operating intertextually - whetherthe films openly display this reference or not. The force of the establishedideas (and ideality) of the Western make it difficult not to see some form of connection. A 'spaghetti' Western is structurally (and thematically)intertextual because it is clearly not a product of the Hollywood system.Similarly, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Quick and the Dead,</em> like so many post-l 960s Westerns (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unforgiven</em> (Eastwood 1992), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Missouri Breaks</em> (Penn 1976), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bad Girls</em> (Kaplin 1994)) seem to be referring to the Wes tern through a system of intertextuality, rather than being one. One of the best examples of this form of intertextuality which produces a Western which exceeds the textual formitself is Sergio Leone's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Once Upon a Time in the West</em> (1968); this is a hyperWesternas it continually asserts the genre over the film itself. All of thesefilms, including Leone's, rely on the intertextual not simply because theyswap between adhering to the structures of the Western and breaking orusurping them (such as, in the example of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Quick and the Dead,</em> with themain gunfighter being a woman), but because the core structureswhichconstitutethe Western film have already been laid down as a textual form. Inthis sense these other films become meta-Westerns, as distinct from the classic Western oreven Bazin'snotion of the sur-Western (films which go beyondtheir generic sensibilities - Bazin's example is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shane</em> (Stevens 1953)).</p>
        <p>So, for example, the gunfight in the middle of the town is so textuallyestablished that in a film such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Quick and the Dead</em> it becomes almostimpossible for the spectator not to make a general reference to all Westerns,and perhaps even something specific like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon.</em> This is the operation of a filmic language, through the reading competence of the spectator and thefilm's constitutive elements, in the production of a discourse. Charactersare shot without blood, time is continually foregrounded, there is a cleardelineation between gunfighter and townspeople, etc. All of these operate<em class="notranslate" translate="no">in potentia</em> to form an intertextual system. The parodic elements (in a postmodernsense) in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Quick and the Dead</em> such as bullet holes appearing asclear tunnels through both the bodies and shadows, and the dreamlikemovement of the camera, serve as reminders of the distance that is coveredby such intertextuality. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unforgiven</em> does this in a different way, with thecharacters openly discussing the mythos of the gunfight, and its positionas an event of the past. In this way <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unforgiven</em> makes an intertextual referenceboth to a part of its own extra diegetic history, and to the Classic Hollywoodtexts such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon.</em> In doing so it also foregrounds a particularsub-textual theme of the Western, that of the morality and ethical coda.(A further, different type of intertextual relationship, this time between<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unforgiven</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Quick and the Dead,</em> is that the same actor - Gene Hackman- plays virtually the same character in both films.) In this way<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Wild Bunch</em> (Peckinpah 1969) anticipates the meta-Western of theselater films, self-reflexive in its tone, yet participating in the genre enoughto be included in it. The characters here, as with William Munnyin <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ueforgiven,</em> do not so much lament the passing of the 'old ways', butself-reflexively acknowledge their anachronistic positions and actions.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Thematic Reference</em></h3>
        <p>Structural intertextuality is often closely tied to thematic references - thatis, when films refer to other films at the level of narrative themes andevents. This can take place in any number of different ways, but some of the more common ones include paralleling the action (or sequences) fromanother film; positioning elements from other films within new contexts;recreating plots or sections of plots. Brian De Palma does this almost methodicallyby 'remaking' scenes, sequences and styles from Hitchcock films.The stabbing scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sisters</em> (1972), for example, is unavoidably and forcefullyan intertextual reference to the shower scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho</em> for those whohave seen the Hitchcock film, or at least know about the specific sceneitself. This sort of intertextual reference works at both a thematic andstructural level.</p>
        <p>Intertextuality does not necessarily have to be from one film to another,as it can also involve references to cultural, historical, and artistic events.If, for example, we accept that the rise of feminism as part of a social andpolitical order has a certain textuality about it, then the spate of women'srevenge against rape films that were madein the 1970s can be seen as a typeof thematic intertextual reference by films to particular social changes.Another variation on this would be films which derive their narrativematerial from actual events. Malik's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Badlands</em> (1973), for example, isbased on quite specific people (Charles Starkweather and Caril AnnFugate), times (1958), and events (their killing spree and eventual capture),but its narrative does not rely on an intertextual knowledge of this.This interpretation of intertextuality is possible if we adopt the semioticnotion that cultural events are also textual systems. This doesn't resolveall the analytic difficulties of combining what are commonly seen as'texts' (such as a specific film or set of films) with the socio-historicalevents which take place in the world. However, such a semiotic approachdoes allow us to formulate a sense of the intertextual across textual orders.This is an important issue in this different formulation of the intertextual.</p>
        <p>A similar idea could be developed in terms of the filmic representationsof Afro-Americans with the appearance of films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shaft</em> (Parks Sn.1971). The character of Julius (Samuel LJackson) in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> (Tarantino1994) demonstrates a further intertextual level, operating as part of the structural referencing. In this case we witness at least three levels of intertextuality, but each one operating in a different referential manner:Julius's dress, speech and mannerisms refer to the representation of AfroAmericansin the films of the 1970s, which in turn have an intertextualreference to the changing cultural order (as opposed to the representationof Marcellus, who is very much a post-l 970s representation). The fact thatthese representations (the three orders being: the representation of blacks in the 1970s; the representations of blacks in the 1990s; the representationsof both these representations - that is, as found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction)</em> are so different,combining (and juxtaposing) one cultural attitude with another, producesa postmodern hybridity that can be neither nostalgia nor parody,but has a sense of both. This, then, forms the third level of intertextuality,spanning the structural and thematic to produce a sign caught up in itsown sense of intertextuality for precisely this point of self-reflection.Furthermore, it is this self-reflexive turn which feeds into the intertextualityof texts and cultural event. What makes such formations interesting istheir positionality, for they can be located neither simply in the text nor thesocio-historical event, but rather must exist in a realm independent of thetwo. The textual reference cannot be part of the cultural events, nor canthose events be defined as strictly part of the textual order. Instead theyliquefy the status and relationships of events and representations of historyand culture.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Synecdochic Structures</em></h3>
        <p>One of the effects of intertextuality is that it does not simply make a point of reference, but it necessarily brings elements of both sources together. Allforms of intertextuality rely on the capacity of the spectator to recognisethe references and make the connections. This does not mean that if thereading competence is absent then the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">meaning</em> of the film (or that part of the film) is lost or misread, but rather that different meanings are produceddepending on the sense of the intertextual reference. This action of conflationis mirrored in what we might call synecdochic structures, and such areading allows us to consider how these complexities might be positionedas part of an intertextual process. In the operation of synecdoche, the intertextualis formed through the part of one film relating to a much largerorder, including another film in its entirety, or a filmic form. As distinctfrom the two formations of intertextuality listed above, the synecdochictends to operate at a level less invested in the strictly textual and more inthe associative. By this is meant that with either a thematic or structuralintertextual reference the spectator may well pick up actual comparablepoints between a number of films, but with intertextuality formed throughsynecdoche there is a positioning of the part (either Ii terally a part of a film,or, more broadly the film itself) standing in for the whole. Hitchcock's briefappearance in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">North by Northwest</em> (1959) operates as a synecdochic formedintertextual reference for all of Hitchcock's films. In such an example thereis a double inflection: Hitchcock as a synecdoche for his oeuvre; Hitchcock'sappearance as a synecdoche for all of his appearances in his films(which operates, for example, as corporeal signature in much the sameway as an author might sign his/her book, or a painter signs their name on the canvas). But the distinguishing feature is that thereis no reference toa specific film through this appearance of the director.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mosaic Formations</em></h3>
        <p>There is a certain type of intertextuality which is formulated not through asystem of referential processes, as we find in the above examples, but anmixing of components of films and their contingent elements. This mixingoperates intratextually, rather than within the intertextual or extratextual.This might sound a little paradoxical, after all to argue for an intratextualsystem actually being intertextual would seem to go against thespirit of textual relations. However what is being posited here is that infact there are certain texts which have elements which by their veryinward-looking status force/encourage the formations of intertextual discourses.</p>
        <p>One of the more common motivating factors for this type of reading strategy is a deeply problematising narrative structure. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Un Chienandalou</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Year at Marienbad</em> (Resnais 1961) are examples of this,where the spectator might struggle to make narrative sense of the wanderingimages or disjunctions of time. In efforts to render sense to the films, thespectator may go beyond the text itselfand look to other, similar films, thecontext of the artistic movements (and so refer to other films from thosemovements), other films by the directors, etc. In doing so the intratextualbecomes intertextual.</p>
        <p>One of the effects of such a system is the sense of disparate parts linkedtogether in structures of a mosaic. The differences are dissolved in theattempts to secure an interpretation, or just access into the film. In someways this is akin to what Eco (1979) calls extra coding. When confrontedby a totally new or different object, sign, event, etc., Eco suggests we havetwo alternatives in our attempt to make sense of the new: to bring this signinto an established code system; or to devise a totally new code system toaccommodate and interpret it. The intertextual mosaic draws on boththese strategies, using the known to explain the unknown, and developingnew techniques of interpretation from this. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Last Tear at Marienhad</em> resistsinterpretation through the established codes of narrative structure -al though we can gain some meaning through these; so we also need toexplore the idea of a <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> which deconstructs space and time, and isnot necessarily a reflection of a character's madness.</p>
        <p>Within these terms (and including the points listed above) it is importantto recognise the intertextual systems as they are positioned throughthe phenomena of the remake. Do we, for example, consider <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Twelve Monkeys</em>(Gilliam 1996) an intertextual reference to Chris Marker's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Jetie</em>(1963)? Or is it necessary to distinguish between the production ofanotherversion of a film and an intertextual reference between films? What such questions reinforce is the idea that the spectator is fundamental to any connectionsmade. In these terms, one spectator may make certain types of intertextual references to science fiction films when watching <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Twelve Monkeys</em> (the similarity between this and other time travel films for example),whilst another might make the connections between it and the Markerfilm. Significant for the discussion here is how we compare these two processes,for this is an issue beyond textual references, and involves the idea of filmic discourse and its operations.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Shattering Pluralism of Film</h3>
        <p>Kristeva's ideas on the intertextual are quite distinct from the morecommon use of the term - in fact she specifically states that for her intertextualityis not this sense of the reference of one text to another. Kristeva offers the terms 'dialogism' and 'transposition' as alternatives to intertextualityto get around this problem. Both terms are derived from the worksof Mikhail Bakbtin, and although he was primarily concerned with thenovel, there is much in his work, and Kristeva's use of it, which can be fruitfullyapplied to cinema. In doing so we can move towards a further understandingof how filmic discourse works. To commence it is useful toconsider Kristeva's definition of the term:</p>
        <p>The term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">inter-textuality</em> denotes this transposition of one (or several) sign systems intoanother; but since this term has often been understood in the banal sense of 'study of sources,' we prefer the term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">transposition</em> because it specifies that the new passage fromone signifying system to another demands a new articulation of the the tic ... If onegrants that every signifying practice is a field of transpositions of various signifyingsystems (an inter-textuality), one then understands that its 'place' of enunciationand its denoted 'object' are never single, complete, and identical to themselves, butalways plural, shattered, capable of being tabulated. {Kristeva 1984b: 59-60)</p>
        <p>This is a rich set of ideas, and there is much to be teased out for an analysisof cinematic transposition. Kristeva requires us to abandon the simplereading of intertextuality (where one of the principal aims is to trackdown reference points from one text to another or others), and instead toconsider how textuality itself is necessarily heterogeneous and plural.To relate these ideas directly to film studies, if the 'signifying practices'Kristeva speaks of is replaced by 'cinema' then we need to examine whatwould constitute the 'field of transpositions', as well as the shattering pluralismof film itself. This will also lead us to consider the idea ofan articulationof the cinematic thetic. What we find continually emphasised here is that there is no single, homogeneous object called 'film' or even 'a film'.ltis in what Kristeva calls the demands of the new articulation that we findthe definitional aspects of film's intertextuality. Or, in short, film is not formulatedin the composition on the screen, but the forceful moments of theact of watching a film, which in turn shifts where the images, sounds, and soon, are placed and how these 'objects' are read. This will be made clearer ifwe consider some of the other points that Kristeva is dealing with.</p>
        <p>To begin then, and to shift the emphasis directly onto our concerns here,what is meant by film's field of transpositions? It is important to recall thatthese ideas are generated by a Kristeva emerging out of a conflation oflinguistictheory, semiotics, and Freudian psychoanalysis, and this in turnhad led her to consider things beyond the 'surface', an examination of thedisruptions and flows of what she describes as the 'poetic' over the Symbolic.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a3"><a href="#fn:a3">3</a></sup> This means that these fields of transpositions are more oftenformed at a level beyond the referential (that is, a beyond to a film's referenceto another or others, and even to its own <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cinemaness);</em> they are, as itwere, an inherent aspect of film's signifying practices. This means, at themost simple level, that every film operates within a field of transpositionswhich include 'cinema', but also 'culture', 'history', 'ideology', 'power',etc. It is not that a film refers to these, but rather that this continuousunrolling of transpositions actually constitutes that which we call'cinema'. I tis significant that Kristeva argues that transposition is 'the signifyingprocess' ability to pass from <em>one</em> sign system to another, toexchange and permutate them' (Kristeva 1984b: 60). So films exchangeand permutate each other, and they exchange with, and permutate/arepermutated with, other sign systems. They also perform this processthrough the act of spectating, which includes the sorts of actions and systemsdiscussed earlier. This is a line of thought which necessarily runscounter to some of the points proposed in Metz's view of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and itslanguage systems.</p>
        <p>Herein lies the shattering pluralism of film. It cannot be containedwithin its signifying practices and processes because film is <em>one</em> of the mosthighly transpositional of all textual systems. There are a number of reasonsfor this, including:</p>
        <p>• Film's compositional nature to what, and how, it represents (includingits relationship to reality; its representational systems; its relationship torealism; its parallels with dreams<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a4"><a href="#fn:a4">4</a></sup>) means that the raw material of film,as well the act of watching a film, will always contain aspects of a transposition <em>between</em> the represented world order, the spectator's worldorder, and the created world order of the film itself (this is also part of the reason why there is such an extensive debate about realism in thehistory of film theory);</p>
        <p>• Film's immense textual range (such as genre, cultural styles, film history)means that what is included is necessarily large. If one considersthat a documentary by Flaherty <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Nanook of the North</em> 1922), a surrealistfilm by Buiiuel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Simon of the Desert</em> 1965), a social commentary film byMike Leigh <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Naked</em> 1993), and a Hollywood studio film by Cameron<em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Titanic</em> 1997) are all part of the signifying practices of cinema, thenthe acts of transposition at both form and content levels are complexand ongoing;</p>
        <p>• Film draws readily and smoothly from other sign systems. Literature,painting, drama, music are obvious examples, but we should not overlookthe relationships between, for example, film and historical discourse,film and politics, the representation of cultural identity in film.</p>
        <p>Such a list can easily be extended, but what is clear from even such a limitedset of examples is that the transpositional aspects of film are muchmore than consequential, and actually are formative of that which isdeemed film's signifying systems and practices. In this sense it can beargued that this transpositional aspect is an essential part of the filmic discourse.We have moved from the position that intertextuality is evident incertain films (for different reasons) to the idea that this inflected sense of intertextuality as transposition is constitutive of filmic discourse.</p>
        <p>One final term from Kristeva needs to be noted before we can examinehow such ideas might operate in a specific film example. Kristeva coins theterm 'thetic' to analyse the threshold oflanguage, and designate a line of demarcation between what she calls the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> and the Symbolic. Oncemore, even though her concerns are more directly related to language(its acquisition and utilisation) there is much here that is important forthe analysis of film. Some key questions include: is there a filmic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> which operates as a disruptive process to the filmic Symbolic? what constitutesfilm's thetic boundaries? does film, in its transpositional processes,problematise the thetic order of other signifying systems?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a5"><a href="#fn:a5">5</a></sup> Perhaps thebest way to consider such questions is one by one, drawing on examplesas we go.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Is There a Filmic</em> Semiotique?</h3>
        <p>The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">shniotique</em> is part of a wider set of issues related to the subject's formation,and the relationship of the subject to language. For Kristeva there is aconstant interplay in the development of the subject (what she describesas the subject-in-process) between the social order of the Symbolic, andthe drives (from, for example, the unconscious) of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique.</em> In theseterms, that which originates from the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> is disruptive, anarchic,possibly antisocial, and a continual challenge to the Symbolic order. Depending on your perspective, it can be seen as a creative, fecund intervention,or a threat to the (social) order oflanguage and the subject; more often than not it is both of these. Interestingly, this division has produced asort of political reinterpretation of the concepts, with some perspectives(for example certain branches of feminism) seeing the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> as a celebratoryand potentially revolutionary 'space' to develop a new system oflanguage, whilst others have seen it as a chaotic and socially disruptive setof processes.</p>
        <p>There is certainly an organised and recognisable system in film (its Symbolicdiscourse order) which dictates how things are represented, howmeanings are constituted, how film operates as a 'language', how film fitsinto a social order of things, etc. But does there exist a filmic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em>which would challenge and disrupt such an order (as well as socialorders), and if so what are its functions? To simplify matters <em class="notranslate" translate="no">we</em> can treatsuch a question at a formal level and at the level of representing such a<em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique.</em> We shall begin with the second, for it is there that some of thefundamentals can be most readily recognised. It is noteworthy that it isprecisely the combination of the two (formal features and representation)that illustrates the idea of transposition, for each of the aspects necessarilyimpacts on the other, and that more often than not we encounter bothformal and thematic aspects of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> in the same text.</p>
        <p>One of the recurring defining qualities of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> that we find inKristeva's writings is its fluidity. She constantly emphasises the flows, effusions,rush and inundations that mark the effects and nature of this powerfulprocess. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The semiotique</em> is that which resists the fixing qualities of the signifyingorders, and as such it is part of the disruptive qualities of the drivesrather than the establishing of meanings. As Kristeva puts it: 'We shall distinguishthe <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> (drives and their articulations) from the realm of signification,which is always that of a proposition or judgement, in otherwords, a realm of positions' (Kristeva l 984b: 43). To dangerously oversimplify,the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> is part of the sliding drives of the unconscious, as distinctfrom the positioning actions of the Symbolic, which attempts to render signsin terms of the practices of the accepted social language structures. Filmcan be seen to be operating at a number of different levels in this context.It could be argued that film itself operates as part of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique,</em> posingdifference in terms of the other textual forms because it is largely an inventionof the twentieth century. Another approach would be to consider whatcertain films portray as part of a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> process. This would be the subject-matter of the films themselves (Pasolini's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Salo</em> (1975) is an example of this) as well as how these films are resisted by the social order. The representationof the forbidden or repressed is part of cinema's discourse, and inthis it has the potential to produce a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> disruption. Or we could considerthe filmic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> as the differences produced in the materiality of film - how, for example, the body represented on the screen becomes morethan a body.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a6"><a href="#fn:a6">1</a></sup> We will discuss one further point on defining the relationshipbetween the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> and the Symbolic before we attempt to apply theseconcepts to some examples.</p>
        <p>The interplay of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> and the Symbolic takes place in andthrough the formation of the subject. This is Kristeva drawing on psychoanalytictheory (especially Lacan) to examine both how the subject isformed, and the relationship of this subject to language systems (in thebroadest possible sense - even ifKristeva's emphasis at the time of writing<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Revolution in Poetic Language</em> was very much with written and spoken language).The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> exists prior to the subject's entry into the Symbolicworld order oflanguage and relationships. For our concerns here, the subjectcan be located in at least three different, but related, sites: the filmicspectator; the characters in the film; the fusions and interlockings of spectatorand character in the formation ofan 'identificatory' site. This third sitenecessarily exists neitherin the text nor the act of spec ta ting, but in a liminalzone constructed out of the act of watching a film and the larger order of film watching practices. (This has connections to the idea of the envy of the gazethat was examined in the earlier chapters.) Here we witness further possibilitiesin film studies, for Kristeva'sidea that transposition demands anotherlevel of articulation is especially relevant to how we might come to understandthe operation of the cinematic apparatus. It is the interplay betweenthese three sites which formulates relational contexts of the Symbolic and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique,</em> and, in turn, the subject as film spectator.</p>
        <p>One way we might utilise such concepts in the analysis of film is to considerthe ways in which film constructs and utilises the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> in terms of the disruption of the filmic Symbolic. An example of this would be theinitial use of the jump-cut by the French New Wave. (I say initial herebecause the jump-cut device follows the way of many manifestations of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> by being drawn into, and even 'normalised' by, the Symbolicorder.) Godard's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souffle</em> contains many examples, but a strikingone is in the apartment scene when Michel Poiccard leans over to kissPatricia Franchini. There are a number of quick, disjunctive cuts prior tothe kiss, and then a visual and aural jump-cut to a travelogue-type aerialview of Paris. All of the established conventions of romance are dramaticallyusurped by the technique, and the swirling camera above Paris alienatesthe usual romantic connotations of the city, rather than confirmingor concentrating them. This has the effect of undercutting the usual conventionsof shots of Paris standing, metaphorically, for love and romance.It deconstructs the line between Rick and Ilsa in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> (Curtiz 1943)that 'We will always have Paris'! In this example from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souffle</em>the filmic Symbolic operates within the conventions of the romance genre,as well as the narrative structures of film. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> functions of the jump-cut perform at both structural (that is, narrative) and thematiclevels to disrupt them.</p>
        <p>Another example of a technical process functioning as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> isthe depth of field perspective in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citizen Kane.</em> Here the invention of acamera lens that enabled focus to be held much further 'into' the sceneallowed different sorts of relationships to be formed within the screen.This may seem less disruptive that the jarring effects of the jump-cut, butwe should not lose sight of the profound impact that such a change in depthof field had on narrative discourses. Representations of relations betweencharacters (including power, love, hate, and mistrust), temporal shifts andspatial enormity, and characters' states of being (such as loneliness andmistrust) are all conveyed through this device. Included in all this is theirony of a narrative that sweeps across power structures of the world, onlyto return to a single tightly shot focus on Rosebud. What gives <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Citi;:;enKane</em> much of its uncanny feeling is the operation of what, for its time,were excessive depths of field constructions, which perform as a type of filmic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em>.Another possibility is to examine how potential, as well as actual, readingsites are formed (in those sites mentioned above) through the interplayof the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> and the Symbolic. Part of the complexity of this issue is thedynamics between the spectating sites posited by the film itself, the relationshipof these sites to the film's Symbolic order, and the further relationshipsof this interplay in terms of the spectator's own Symbolic and<em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> positionalities. Some films openly contort these relationships,and a specific example can be used to illustrate this. Wes Craven continuallydraws on the established codes of the horror film to foreground them,not always in terms of parody, but rather to reassert the function of horror - to deliberate on horrality and its operation in watching thesefilms. Films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (1984), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Scream</em> (1996), and itssequel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Scream 2</em> (1998), function precisely on acknowledging the horrorgenre (that is, a specified Symbolic order of film), openly stating its operations(deconstructing it through a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sbniotique</em> disruption of those conventions)in order to intensify the horror (a second-level <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> whichattempts to discard the formula of the genre in order to create a greaterlevel of terror). This formal redefining of the Symbolic and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em>orders of a specific film genre is extended into the social Symbolic througha similar process. The strict morality of the horror genre in the 1980s and1990s (the punishment of middle-class suburban teenagers for what isrepresented as sexual openness or transgressions - which has such strongresonance of the morality of the AIDS age) is foregrounded in Craven'sfilms, as well as other examples such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>(Gillespie 1997) (where we find an open discussion by the characters of the urban myths of sexuality in contemporary horror narratives).</p>
        <p>The curious aspect to all this is that the seemingly <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> elements of these films (the elements of horror, the personification of evil, the sociallydisruptive forces) are inverted to actually reinforce the Symbolic orders of both film and the cultural climate. It is almost as if one of the most seeminglydisruptive aspects of the genre has <em>been</em> relocated into the centreof the Symbolic, rather than at any point in the thetic disruptions. It isthe Symbolic order which produces the themes and images of horror,rather than the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique.</em> In the horror films of the 1950s and 1960s (suchas the vampire films, the Frankenstein films, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho, Peeping Tom</em> (Powell1960), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Wickerman</em> (Hardy 1973)) the site of horror was almost alwayspositioned as socially disruptive, anarchic and morally perverse. The Hollywoodreworking of the Frankenstein story illustrates just how pervasivethis process was, turning the persecuted figure in Shelley's novel into asocial evil. Shelley's original representation of Frankenstein's 'monster' isperhaps much closer to the socially maligned figure of Freddy Kruger thanmight first appear to be the case. The second wave of horror films investsthe terror much more closely in the domain of the social Symbolic (in anAmerican context, at least, the overtly normal and average teenager,located in the most ordinary of suburbs), which in turn leads to the filmicrepresentation of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> (the terror and abject) to be part of thisordinariness. Lynch's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blue Velvet</em> positions its whole narrative structureand film style in this recognition of the blandness of the social order, underscoringwith a dark menace that which is ultimately revealed to be anotherinflection of that social order. A significant film in this change is Kubrick's<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Shining</em> (1980), as it seeks to offer a reading site from the perspective of the mad and possessed Jack. He commits no great 'sin', except for goingagainst the morality of the work ethic, and perhaps for being ordinary.In this reinterpretation of the horror genre, it is the ordinary that definesthe potential for transgression. This, in turn, positions the everyday as harbouringthe <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique.</em> In order to understand the interplay between theSymbolic and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">simiotique</em> more we can turn to this issue of the thetic.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">What Constitutes Film's Thetic Boundaries?</em></h3>
        <p>This is a difficult question because it taps into one of the unresolved (andperhaps unresolvable) issues of film studies, that of what constitutes a filmlanguage. However, we can bypass those difficulties here by consideringhow something like a the tic boundary can operate in film. The the ticrepresents both boundary and disruption to the various orders of the Symbolicand <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique.</em> Importantly, it is not simply a division between thetwo, for its operation is fundamental to the formation of meanings, orwhat Kristeva describes as 'the positionality of signification' (Kristeva1984b: 43). This meaning formation is derived from the positioning of elements within contexts, as well as specifying a position in which they canbe interpreted. Significant to our concerns for film, Kristeva specifies thatthis process is not simply language derived, but depends on the subject'srelationship to the image. To sum up then, the thetic has the followingattributes: it represents the positioning of subject to object; it demarcatesdifference between these two; it marks the threshold of language systems(including the cinematic); it presents a certain type of relationship of thesubject to the self, via the image; it provides a line of demarcation betweenthe Symbolic and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> (as well as containing the moments of thedisruption between them); it marks the moment of the subject's entry intothe Symbolic.</p>
        <p>As we have just noted, there does appear to be a realm of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em>necessary to film's operation, so it is reasonable to posit that there is alsothis thetic boundary in operation. The trick then becomes attempting todefine what constitutes it and how it operates in terms of film and the spectator.It is important to recognise that film necessarily has at least twocodifications of the thetic: a boundary outside of the textual order (thesocial/cultural and historical, for example); and a set of thetic boundarieswhich exist within the films themselves. Not all films challenge one or bothof the operations of these boundaries (and in doing so foregrounds them),but they all have them. At one level the thetic marks the spectator's entryinto the film, shifting the sorts of spectral and image relationships to the selfin terms of a broader set of cultural and textual issues. It also marks thepoint where the spectator engages in the Symbolic order of the film itself,in turn altering that through interpretation, response, and creation. So theact of spectating necessarily contains within it the acknowledgment andcrossing of the thetic into a different world order - one derived from thefilm, the cinematic apparatus, the Symbolic order, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">semiotique</em> and thespectator's own positionality. To engage in this issue further we must nowturn to another source and consider the interplay between spectator, film,and discourse.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinematic Power/Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Foucault's ideas on discourse are at once complex and rewarding. His challengeto how we might read the relationships between the subject, socialinstitutions, and power are dependant on his theorising of the operationand functions of discourse. Our concern here is how we might utilise Foucault'ssense of how discourses are formulated, operate, and collapse inunderstanding on the one hand film's discursive practices, and on theother, the relationship of film to other discourses. Once we have consideredsome of these aspects it will be possible to consider in greater depth the possibilities of these ideas for film studies - something that will be taken upin the ensuing cha pt er on the body. We can commence this part of thestudy by considering one of Foucault's key works, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>(1986a), and how the ideas might be translated into the study of filmic discourses.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a7"><a href="#fn:a7">1</a></sup></p>
        <p>One of Foucault's primary concerns in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Archaeology of Knowledge</em> is noless than the ways in which knowledge is produced, formed, and restrictedthrough discursive practices. As Foucault puts it, his aim is to examine'that field in which the questions of the human being, consciousness,origin, and the subject emerge, intersect, mingle, and separate off' (Foucault1986a: 16); and what we shall be concerned with here is film's positionwithin such a scheme. Foucault is attempting to write his owntheoretical treatise here - a self-reflexive turn on how to isolate and analysethe very methodologies that are in use. Clearly with a project such asthis, without a hint of film studies in it, we are proceeding into territorythat will need to be carefully developed. Some of Foucault's ideas willhave little or no direct relevance to the concerns here, whilst othersshould prove fecund and stimulating. The proposal here is to follow Foucault'sown developments of the idea of discourse, which will then make itpossible to apply these concepts to film.</p>
        <p>Foucault begins <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Archaeology of Knowledge</em> by examining what he termsthe unities of discourse - those aspects imposed on a collection of materials/textualities/phenomena that makes them seem somehow united. His examplesinclude the book, the formations of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">oeuvre,</em> and even large-scaleunities such as 'science' and the 'humanities'. Whatever they are, andwhatever seems to keep them involved in processes of cohesion, these unitiesfunction in a very powerful way. Part of their operation is to link, sort,exclude, and define groupings of knowledge. One of the effects of this is thatthese unities gain, over time, a sense of truth and knowledge itself. Theypass from the status of artificial constructions and subjective positions tobecoming ways of thinking about things, and the ways in which culturesproduce systems of knowledge.</p>
        <p>We have already encountered some of the implications of this notion of discursive unities with film. The very diversity of the filmic form seems toinitially suggest that sometimes its unities are premised entirely on a technologicaland material basis, for how else could such a heterogeneous set of objects be seen as part of the same field? Yet how fruitful and accurate isthis? So, for example, how is it possible to demarcate 'film' through itsmaterial form when there is a slippage across television, video, DVD,MPEG (perhaps even animation), as well as different film stock (16mm,35mm, 70mm)? 'Film' may initially appear to be a designation of a textualform derived from its material base, but the experience of film isclearly something much greater than this; and it is this <em class="notranslate" translate="no">something more</em> that constitutes its discursive unities. In order to try to understand what thismight be we can turn to other, connected points from Foucault.</p>
        <p>Foucault employs the term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">statement</em> to designate the 'elementary units of a discourse' (Foucault 1986a: 80). The division does create some problemsfor his project (distinguishing exactly what a statement is, what itsconstitutive elements are, etc., proves to be a huge and perhaps impossibletask), but the strategy behind it is for Foucault to work on how discoursesproduce these statements, and how the statements themselves function inthe operation of the unities of the discourse. Foucault, using ideas fromhis earlier works, gives the example of a discourse of madness (Foucaultl 986a: 32-3), asking if all statements referring to, and representing, madnessconstitute part of the unities of that discourse. Following Foucault, wecan ask if a case study by Freud, a schizophrenic walking down the street infront of us, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Silence of the Lambs</em> (Demme 1991) are part of the discourseof madness - and if so, how does each of these statements relate to theothers in the unities of the discourse? Or, approaching this from a differentangle, does a corpus of films treating the same subject in totallydifferent ways (pro- and anti-war films for example) constitute a set of statements that are tied together, even if their ideological basis is in totalopposition? These two examples illustrate that the issue of a filmic discoursetakes on both the relationship of film to other discourses, and therelationship of discourses within film itself. Either way we still need totackle the same issues that Foucault foregrounds in order to define andunderstand the concept of discourse in film.</p>
        <p>What is important to recognise in Foucault's analysis here is not that hesimply wants a theory of discourse and unities, but more to understand theelements of the production of these. In other words, this is a theorisingabout how, and possibly why, the formation of discourses takes place, andwhat relationship this has to the ways in which the cultural, epistemological,political, and textual forces are involved. Foucault suggests fourhypotheses in approaching this difficulty of defining statements, their relationshipsto objects, and their positionality in discourse:</p>
        <p>I. 'statements different in form, and dispersed in time, form a group if theyrefer to one and the same object' (Foucault 1986a: 32).</p>
        <p>Foucault rejects this because of the impossibilities of describing the vastrange of differences between different statements, and the relative 'weakness'of the unification of the object. That is, it may not be enough tosay that the object of the statements unifies them sufficiently. A documentaryfilm of an operation to train medical students and a film by Peckinpah(such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Wild Bunch)</em> or De Palma (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Body Double</em> 1984) may havethe same amount of blood, but such filmic statements of the consanguinity do not necessarily form a discursive grouping (even if for the viewer theyproduce the same squeamish effects). This is not simply about intentionalityof form (for example, the didactic against the entertaining), althoughthis can <em class="notranslate" translate="no">be</em> part of the differences, but involves a far wider sweep of issues.Blood, in these two examples, has a direct attachment to violence (and anaesthetics of violence) in Peckinpah's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Wild Bunch,</em> but considerations of either violence or aesthetics are not readily apparent in most medicaltraining films. Similarly, the 'reality' of the blood distinguishes the two films: the medical film has real blood (but which may look fake because of the domination of Hollywood notions of realism) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Wild Bunch</em> hasfake blood (but has been presented to look real), but our perception andreading of this status does not necessarily rely on how real or fake theblood actually is.</p>
        <p>2. The group of relations between statements is designated by their formand type of connection.</p>
        <p>Foucault's example here is how medical science in the nineteenth centurybecame defined 'not so much by its objects or concepts as by a certain <em class="notranslate" translate="no">sryle,</em>a certain constant manner of statement' (Foucault 1986a: 33). He abandonsthis idea because a style of discourse is necessarily in a constant stateof evolving, so much so that, as Foucault puts it, the discourse disintegratesas soon as it appears (Foucault l 986a: 34). German Expressionist cinemacould be considered in a similar way. There are a group of films which aredominated by stylistic features, clearly recognisable and forming quitespecific connections. However, as with Foucault's example of nineteenth century medical discourse, there are a number of factors which formulatethis group of relations which may well exist outside of the films themselves,so that the idea of a discourse defined along these lines becomes difficultto argue. Which is not to say, as may first appear, that something likeGerman Expressionist <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> cannot be considered a discourse (or havethese Foucauldian unities), but rather that we must find alternatives of defining such a discourse other than through this hypothesis of form andtypes of connection. German Expressionist <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was, amongst otherthings, a conflation of historical factors and moments, a certain economicforce in Germany, a positioning within a particular moral code, and aresponse to particular artistic (largely painting) styles and developments.It would be far too simplistic to argue that German Expressionist cinemawas just a style, because as these historical and textual forces and influencesaltered, so too did the cinema. The discourse of this film movement did disintegratewith the release of one of its first films, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cabinet of Dr Caligari</em>(Wiene 1919), because it was in a constant state of flux, as well as continuouslyredefining itself. Furthermore, determining discourse in this way is always open to the difficulties of historicism. German Expressionist cinemais more clearly formulated afterwards when paradigms of histories andrelations are placed over events.</p>
        <p>3. Groups of statements can be formed 'by determining the system of permanentand coherent concepts involved' (Foucault 1986a: 34).</p>
        <p>What Foucault is getting at here is the idea that, through constant use andrule defining, certain concepts come to be recognised as continuous in,and therefore formulate, the discourse. Foucault gives, and then undermines,the example of Classical analysis of language. Here, he argues,there seems to be a distinct set of rules and concepts that can be clearlydefined and recognised through their continued usage. The problem, Foucaultsays, is that these are false unities because they cannot account for allvariations, and the supposed coherency can only ever operate within astrictly defined perspective (in Foucault's example a historical and linguisticone). The same can be argued in terms of film. The idea that filmic discoursemight have permanent and coherent concepts is quickly dismissed ifwe consider how rapidly it has changed in its relatively short history. Evensomething as seemingly pervasive as the length of a narrative film varies aconsiderable amount both in cross-cultural examples and within specificindustries, as well as film forms. Hollywood's narrative films tended to getlonger in the 1990s, breaking the coherency of the 90-minute film whichpreceded it.</p>
        <p>4. 'a fourth hypothesis to regroup the statements, describe their interconnexionand account for the unitary forms under which they are presented:the identity and persistence of themes' (Foucault 1986a: 35).</p>
        <p>Here we have a corresponding idea to that of styles, only motivated thistime by the themes of a discourse. Once more Foucault sees the difficultyin this as being the diversity of the themes, the disagreements within thetreatment of such themes, and the problems of recognition when a themestill fits into the unities of the discourse, or has altered the discourse itself.Foucault instead argues that it is not in the solidification of themes as unitiesthat such a strategy might rest, but rather in the 'dispersion of thepoints of choice that the discourse leaves free' (Foucault l 986a: 36). Thisreveals Foucault's thinking that if we look to the moments between the unities,the gaps in the seemingly coherent groupings, then what appears arethe very mechanisms for such formations. This is the case not just of this lasttype, but of all the four hypotheses, and one that may prove most useful forour concerns on cinematic discourse.</p>
        <p>Foucault's tactics for going beyond the sorts of discursive formationsthat have come to hold a powerful legitimacy in, for example, the productionof meanings and interpretive processes, as well as defining the discoursesthemselves, becomes his concern for many years, and the subjectof many of his books. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Archaeology of Knowledge</em> he introduces theidea of the statement, which is the sign transformed into a validated andvalorised unit. In other words, discourses privilege certain signs to makethem seem more meaningful, more truthful, more substantial of that discourse.A scientific discourse will invest certain signs with the sense of scientific'truth' or 'fact', thus positioning them as statements (and subsequentlyof greater significance and importance within the discourse of science).Foucault sees this as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">will to truth,</em> which in turn becomes what heargues is a relationship inextricably tied to power: 'It's not a matter of emancipating truth from every system of power (which would be chimera,for truth is already power), but of detaching the power of truth from theforms of hegemony, social, economic, and cultural, within which it operatesat the present time' (Foucault 1986b: 74-5). Foucault designatesthose elements which produce these importance-laden statements theenunciative function. (We shall retain this term of enunciation here, eventhough a more apposite word for the visual could perhaps be coined. Thereason for this is that it is the positioning of subjectivities that comes tounderlie much of the enunciative function, so there are certain advantagesfor extending the sense of the term here, rather than offering alternatives.)</p>
        <p>There are a number of different ways we might make use of these ideas interms of addressing the idea of cinematic discourse. Perhaps the mostdirect approach to take here is to consider the idea of cinematic statementsand the sorts of enunciative functions that operate to form them. Putanother way, this would be considering that which seems to be cinematic- that which has cinematic 'power' and cinematic 'truth' - andhow such designations have come to be attached to these statements.Once we have looked at this it will be possible to consider how the relationshipof power/knowledge (as figured by Foucault) functions in the formationand operation of cinema. Once more we shall proceed by mapping outsome of the key ideas and then considering them in terms of film.</p>
        <p>Foucault commences his defining of the enunciative function with anexample of the production of a statement. He argues that by copyingdown the letters of a typewriter keyboard we produce a statement. This isthe statement of 'the letters of the alphabet in an order that makes thetyping of them easier, and the statement of a random group of letters'(Foucault 1986a: 88). He sets out to dismiss what might appear to be twopossible methods of the enunciative function: reproduction and the interventionof the subject. The first of these relates to the capacity to reproducethe signs to make copies; yet the act of copying (recognising rules, etc.) does not produce statements. The intervention of the subject is also not necessarilypart of the enunciative function, for the reproduction of a series of signsby the subject does not necessarily mean that a statement is formed.Instead, Foucault argues, 'a series of signs will become a statement on conditionthat it possesses "something else" ... a specific relation that concernsitself- and not its cause or its elements' (Foucault 1986a: 89). Afterdetailing all the things that this is not, Foucault produces what he sees asone of the key concepts: the enunciative function is invested in the subject/text who is given the right to 'speak', the sites from where such statementsare produced, and the power relations involved. From this position Foucaultmoves towards defining discourse and the archaeological method,but before we take up those particular ideas let us consider these pointsthrough some cinematic examples.</p>
        <p>There are three basic inflections to this idea of the cinematic enunciativefunction and the statements formed by it:</p>
        <p>1. That of certain <em>external</em> enunciative functions and statements as theymight be applied to cinema. This would be how we might consider thetransposition of statements from one discourse into the cinematic discourse,the sorts of effects that these statements have on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> (andvice versa), the interaction between discourses, and so on.</p>
        <p>2. The relationship between <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and the formation of such statements.This would be to argue that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> actually produces statements whichare positioned outside of itself (that is, have an effect beyond the experienceof film) by utilising its enunciative functions.</p>
        <p>3. Specific formations of cinematic enunciative functions and statements.This would be the production and operation of signs of cinematic powerand truth as they operate within and across films. (A formation we witnessedearlier in a different modality in terms of transposition.)</p>
        <p>It is important to note that these three are not mutually exclusive, and it isquite possible, and common, for all three to be in operation at once. This issignificant because the whole analysis of the discourse depends on a breakingdown of those aspects which might attempt to provide division.Deleuze points out that a literary piece, a proposition from science, aneveryday sentence, and the utterance of a schizophrenic are all equallystatements (Deleuze 1972: 44-5). Acknowledging this, it is perhaps mostuseful to consider how we can observe all three in operation at once,as well as seeing them function independently within specific examples.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a8"><a href="#fn:a8">8</a></sup> To keep with the Foucauldian theme here the example chosen is Beineix'sfilm of madness and sexuality, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Betty Blue</em> (1986).</p>
        <p>Let us proceed somewhat artificially to begin with and try to transposesome of these ideas from Foucault onto the film, looking, as it were, for Foucault in the abandoned seaside, the outer reaches of Paris, and theescape into the rustic idylls of the country town. In doing so it may be possibleto preserve a certain distance from the themes themselves. On thisnote, it would be tempting here to dip into Fouacault's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Madness and Civilisation</em> (l987b) and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">History of Sexuality</em> volumes, given that so much of that material resonates in the film. However, to avoid too literal a readingof Foucault, and of Betty in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Betty Blue</em> (that is, the closeness of themesshould make us wary of being led away from the critical aspects) we shallcontinue with certain archaeologies of discourse, leaving the genealogiesfor later attention.</p>
        <p>For all the problems Foucault's methodologies produce in developingthe study of discourse - and it is clear that far more uncertainties areraised than answers yielded - one of the more certain aspects is the ideaof the enunciative position. This concept of the 'speaking' subject is arecurring theme in poststructuralist work and one we shall return to often. For Foucault it is the subject who produces the discourse, as well asthe subject produced by the discourse. This is a potent process to attributeto discourses, their statements and enunciative functions, for it is nothingless than how the subject is positioned within the power structures of meaning,knowledge, truth, and existence. Film, like other narrative systems,develops such enunciative functions within the created world order. Thiscan be as simple an example as the sorts of truth statements linked to thenarrating position. The camera itself operates as part of the filmic enunciativefunction, constantly producing statements about events, histories,ethics, interrelationships - in short, the whole range of discursive practicesof narrative - by representing them within the shots. The term 'discursivepractice' is used here in the very specific sense developed by Foucault as'a body of anonymous, historical rules, always determined in the timeand space that have defined a given period, and for a given social, economic,geographical, or linguistic [or, in our specific concerns, filmic]area, the conditions of operation of the enunciative function' (Foucaultl 986a: 11 7). Discursive practices, then, determine how things are represented,what is permitted to be represented, and the distinguishing featuressuch as truth and meaning.</p>
        <p>Betty represents a sort of Foucauldian resistance to the culturally defineddiscursive practices (especially of sexuality and rational behaviour), and indoing so the sorts of statements she produces are read as anarchic, sociallytransgressive, excessive, and, ultimately, insane by those operations of the social order. Betty's enunciations are not simply dismissed by the filrnicnarrative (which has its own, internal discursive practices), but ratherthey are offered as having their own sense of the statement. Such statementsare presented as bewildering, violent, confused and confusing, yetthey are consistent. This quality of consistency (her various obsessions with production - love, sex, Zorg's manuscript, a baby - is one exampleof this) is not necessarily part of the statement-making process, nor does itprovide an explanation for Betty's actions and outbursts (such explanationswould be generated out of the discourses and enunciative statementsof the social order - such as psychiatry, law, social restraint - she resists),but it does provide a sense of development - a history of the spiral towardsmadness - which comes to operate as a discursive practice. In other words,we can look not simply to the demonstrations of resistance that Betty operatesin for a detailing of this other discursive practice, producing its ownenunciative functions and statements, but to the ways in which the conditionsof operation are developed and performed. The monotonous paintingof the beach houses, for example, is 'meaningful' for Zorg and his employerin part because it fits into the discursive practices of economic exchangeand capitalism, yet to Betty it is a futile, unproductive exercise withoutchange and therefore of no significance. It is through her eyes that the spectatorisrepositioned to see Zorg's passive acceptance as an act of madness,even if her own responses (such as burning the beach house) are seen as justas mad, and more excessive, but in a different way. Betty's discourse andstatements of passion alter the way in which the spectator interpretsher actions.</p>
        <p>This economic exchange is also about power and punishment - both of which Zorg, for most of the film, accepts as inevitable. What is significant isthat the discursive practices presented are based not on the issues of thesane against the insane, but on statements of productivity and change.Betty reacts against the Sisyphus-type qualities of this employment; justas she reacts against Zorg's unproduced manuscript, and her own role of mother as producer. This is not about death and stasis however (thecomic elements of the funeral and Betty's refusal to sleep in the deadmother's bed undercut that sort of reading), but rather about the meaningfulnessof the statements produced by the enunciative functions. TheSymbolic world order determines Betty's statements as excessive andtherefore mad; yet Betty sees the sorts of meanings offered in the everydayas falsehoods and pointless. It is quite in keeping with Foucault's perspectiveon the operation of discursive practices and power/knowledgethat Betty would suffer so terribly in this inevitable clash of discourses.His <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Discipline and Punish</em> (1987a) (as well as the case study entitled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">I, PierreRiviere, Having Slaughtered My Mother, My Sister, and My Brother)</em> is full of similar examples of the power of dominant discourses enforced against thesubject and the pains caused.</p>
        <p>What we observe in such an analysis of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Betty Blue</em> is not just a type of representation of some of these ideas on Foucault and discourse, but alsohow they operate within the filmic utterance. As was noted in the previouschapters, the relationship between a film and its spectator is informed by certain relationships; one of the fundamental attributes of many of theserelationships is this construction of power/knowledge. This includes theinvestment of certain cinematic signs and discourses (including sites of spectating) with a sense of power and meaning. These are the statementsthat the spectator uses to create meanings and understand the film, as wellas those attributes that the film uses to construct the spectator and his/hersite of interpretation. This interplay (which necessarily includes the formationof the subject as spectator) will be taken up in the following chapterwhen <em>we</em> consider further the formation and operation of cinematic discoursesand their power/knowledge. It is here that we can also observe inmore detail the processes of not only the representational fields of cinematicdiscourse, but also its operation.</p>

            <li id="fn:a2">The lineage ofMetz's work also demonstrates this. From the structuralist/semiotic early works of <em>Film Language: A Semiotics of the Cinema</em> ( 197 4) to the blend of semiotics and psychoanalysis in <em>The Imaginary Signifier: Psychoanalysis and the Cinema</em> (1985), there is a recurring theme of film language and how we might read it.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a2">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a3">Kristeva's Symbolic is derived from Lacan (via Levi-Strauss) and, generally speaking, means the social/cultural domain, the operation of the sign in a coded language structure, and the processes of communication. Her sense of the poetic language is far broader than a literary model, and involves those disruptive elements which challenge, change and collapse those signifying practices of the Symbolic. In some ways the idea of a cinematic language derived from such a 'poetic' discourse parallels what Pasolini describes theoretically as a cinema of poetry (Pasolini 1976: 542-58) and is evident in his film practice.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a3">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a4">This idea has been developed, most notably, by Baudry in, for example, 'The Apparatus: Metapsychological Approaches to the Impression of Reality in the Cinema' and 'Ideological Effects of the Basic Cinematographic Apparatus'.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a4">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a5">Our principal concern here is with the relationship of these concepts to filmic discourse; however, in Chapters 4 and 5 we will consider the cultural contexts and implications of such ideas. For this reason tackling this particular issue will be taken up at a later point.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a5">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a6">This point will be taken up in more detail in the following chapter.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a6">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a7">The question arises as to why we should focus on <em>Tiu Archaeology of Knowledge</em> when Foucault himself later points out the problems of some of these strategies, leading him to develop what he termed a genealogical approach to these issues and problems. The answer is twofold. Firstly, Foucault never actually abandons his archaeological ideas and methods, but he does refine them considerably. There is much to be gained by considering the ideas he posits in this book both in terms of understanding Foucault's opus, and applying his ideas to film. Secondly, to develop some ideas on film and discourse, and filmic discourse, it is important to engage in the ideas from the archaeology approach. In doing so we gain, at the very least, the possibility of mapping out some concepts on what a Foucauldian approach to film might look like. It is also important to recognise the position of this work in terms of Foucault's own development. Coming after the 'historical studies' on madness and medicine, and following <em>The Order of Things</em> (1970) as a type of development of technique, <em>The Archaeology</em> ef <em>Knowledge</em> is Foucault's own selfreflexive turn, just as he asks us to adopt such a position ourselves. In the following chapter Foucault's ideas on power and discourse in terms of film will be developed more fully.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a7">↩</a></li>
            <li id="fn:a8">The ensuing examples are intended to serve as notional pieces until a more extensive analysis and set of examples is taken up in the following chapter on the body and discourse.<a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:a8">↩</a></li>
