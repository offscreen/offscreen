        <p>That <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is a cultural phenomenon is beyond dispute, but what do we mean when we say such a thing? What is meant by the assertion that a film is produced by, read in, and gains meaning from, its cultural postionings? There has been a wide and diverse range of film theories that have attempted to deal with these sorts of issues. These include: theories devised out of a Marxist tradition, where the emphasis is on the ideological processes in different aspects of film; feminist film theory, where the emphasis is on the formations and explorations of gender, sexuality, and power; and certain psychoanalytic approaches to the film text, which see a melding of different influences, including, for example, Althusser's blending of Marxist philosophy and Lacanian theory, and Kristeva's intellectual lineage of psychoanalysis, feminism and cultural theory. The complexity of the issues involved, and the diversity of approaches, makes summary neither practical nor desirable. Instead the focus here (and in the following chapter) will be on some possibilities for locating <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> within cultural contexts and processes. To this end the following discussion will focus on a particular example - that of love - in order to work through some of the ideas on <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and culture. The issue will be how cinematic formations of love can be analysed to interpret relationships between film and cultural contexts. This, in turn, will allow us to consider how certain critical movements argue for a type of intertextual exchange between culture and text.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and Its Discontents</h3>
        <p>At one level what is to be argued here is that particular relationships which exist within <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and cultures are motivated, and organised, by a type of discontent. This is a discontent that is fecund and vibrant, an unsettling relationship based on slippage and challenge, where film's cultural underpinning can <em class="notranslate" translate="no">be seen</em> as a seismic one. This is so because the operation of and subject positions. At tbe very least, the heterogeneity of the film and its spectators ensures this. Part of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has always had this function of problematising, of foregrounding difficult issues, of questioning, of allowing, sometimes even forcing, its audience to look at situations (histories, cultures, attitudes) differently. Even within the most 'conservative' examples we can find moments of this cultural discontent. This is not to say that all films question tbe cultural order, or that tbey attempt to erode the ideological frames in which tbey are produced and/or are read. Films have been as sexist, racist, misogynistic, politically biased, etc. as any other cultural production. Therefore they can conform to, and confirm, the dominant ideological paradigms. But rather than focus on those moments of film that attempt to settle into the major ideological contexts in which they are produced and/or read, the concern here will be how film (and the film viewer) problematises such contexts, working at the level of discontent. This discontent operates not necessarily within the politics of tbe film, but in the gestures of the spectator as he/she engages witb tbe film.</p>
        <p>Much of the theory that attempts to position texts within social, historical, and ideological contexts does so from one of three broad paradigms, or combinations of them, producing different theories on tbe social realities of tbe text. (This is perilously close to over-generalisation and is intended as summation and backdrop rather tban a model tbat is deeply accurate.) The first type examines tbe production of the text within socio-cultural and ideological contexts. This includes tbe classic Marxist idea of base and superstructure, with the base being the economic conditions of production, and the superstructure tbe manifestations of the culture (including texts) and its ideological dimensions. The most obvious difficulty with this approach is that it has an inherent implication of reflection between the two structures, and argues that we can determine ideological operations and reflections as they are apparent in the film. The two dominant issues of interpretation in this sense are tbat the superstructure emerges from the base structure; and tbat analysis needs to be directed at tbe influence of the superstructure on the formation and function of the base structure. Another conceptual aspect of this approach is the relationship between texts and history, drawing on the conflict-based model of the dialectical process. The second type deals witb the interplay between texts and social order, with each affecting the otber in different ways. This is tbe ideological and revolutionary force of the texts themselves as they resist, alter and challenge the ideological contexts. The writings of Pierre Macherey are a good example of this, in which he argues that art has the capacity to expose and criticise ideological systems. An example of this is the text's capacity to analyse and foreground processes such as reification (Marx's idea that relationships between people can be constructed in terms of the objectification of tbe subject, so leading to alienation). The third type is really a conflation of different theories, not homogeneous in either style or direction. This would include feminist theory as it analyses the politics of gender, postcolonialism and its critique of cultural politics (such as in Edward Said), the combinations of Marxist theory and psychoanalysis (such as in Althusser and Homi Bhabha), and Kristeva's analysis of culture in a blend of ideological analysis and the formations of the subject, the analysis of language systems in terms of their ideological effects, etc. In short, this third paradigm is concerned with the complex network of relationships between culture, ideology, and the subject as active (as well as passive) social agent.</p>
        <p>In order to better understand how we might approach the idea of film and its relationship to culture, as well as the operation of concepts such as ideology, power, and the role of the spectator, we shall now turn to love. This is not an attempt to resolve the myriad complexities of these concepts in the analysis of film; rather it is an example in which we witness different sorts of cultural forces coming into play. The creation and function of the cinematic sign of love can reveal much about the theoretical concepts, and how film operates within cultural contexts.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">On Love</h3>
        <p>Love is one of the primary processes of cinema, not just at the level of representation (of which it occupies a central role in a great many films), but also as a type of cinematic drive which in turn produces an amatory economy (as distinct from say the libidinal economy of Lyotard). It is precisely this amatory economy - this drive in, through and by cinematic love - that forms a key domain in film's cultural contexts and processes. In other words, that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> deals with, and constantly returns to, love locates it as part of a cultural order. In this relationship film contributes to (through participation, challenges to, reformulating) a culture's discourses of love. This idea of the amatory economy will help us remain close to the central issue of cinema's cultural functions, while allowing a discussion of how film produces a type of discourse within this larger order. Furthermore, this section will be concerned not simply with the representation of love, but also how love can be seen as a metaphor for cinematic epistemologies. To this end the motifs we will consider are the kiss and true love. Before we turn to these, however, a further comment is needed on the idea of the cinematic drive in these terms of love and culture.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Amatory Drive</em></h3>
        <p>The drive, as we have observed elsewhere, is what psychoanalysis describes as a primary process in the operation of the unconscious, as well as the formulation of the subject. It performs this second function particularly through the formation of certain relationships between the unconscious and conscious, as well as between the subject and his/her existence in the Symbolic order (that is, in effect culture). To argue that there might be something called the cinematic drive is tied up with all these issues; at one level it is part of the operation of the cinematic apparatus as it manages, performs, and produces narrative effects. That is to say, the cinematic drive is the force which binds the different aspects of film together as they move towards certain points of representation and meaning. A simple example of this is how lighting, sound, camera angles, and character dialogue are brought together in the cinematic drive towards acertain diegetic construction or interpretative point. At another level we can speak of the cinematic drive performing those qualities of desire, in which we find the space where spectator and film meet.</p>
        <p>The cinematic drive can be split into two primary strands, with variations stemming from each of these. The first is what we shall designate as the semiotic drive, which contains within it the properties of film the spectator draws on to make meanings, construct intertextual and transpositional connections, understand code structures, etc. The semiotic drive in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is heavily invested in the whole set of film elements that are produced in the film and in the watching of it. It is important to note that this drive is not simply the film and its constitutive elements (such as the narrative processes), but also includes the act of constructing the spec ta ting position. The second drive is even more firmly located in these performances, but derived this time from the act of spectating - that is, from the spectator himself/herself. To distinguish this from the sorts of drives that psychoanalysis designates as the scopic, we shall refer to it here as the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">spectral</em> drive. This contains all those attributes and qualities of the spectating position, including the sexual drives, the body of the film spectator, the cultural order of the spectator, etc.</p>
        <p>The movement of the drive, for Lacan, is always one of outwards from the source (subject or film here) and then back. Lacan (1986: 178) constructs the following diagram to illustrate this; next to it is a modified version which positions <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and spectator within the model (see Figure 5.1).</p>
        <p>What these diagrams show is the ways in which the drives move out from, and then return to, the (cinematic) rim. This presents us with a number of issues, not the least being how different aims are fulfilled, or merged, through this action. The arching loop, which represents the drives of the spectator and the cinematic, is what we as spectators do with the elements of a film as we watch it; as well as what those elements do to us. There is always a return back to the rim of film/culture because no matter how divergent these drives of the spectator are, they are ultimately always grounded within the representations and devices of the film and its cultural contexts and production. This loop, then, is the movement of the cinematic drive in conjunction with the drives of the spectating subject (and so necessarily contains both the scopic and spectral drives) as they come to form the act of spectating.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup> All of this is shaped and determined in various ways by the cultural basis to which it returns. One final point on this, and then we can begin to locate some of this material within some specific examples.</p>
        <p>Lacan's emphasis on the scopic drive - which, as we have noted, is integral to this model - is that it is motivated by desire. Its awareness is derived from the introduction of the Other, transforming the scopic into the voyeuristic, which in turn ties it to pleasure. In other words, the scopic drive, through this attribute of pleasure, comes to formulate the subject itself; subjectivity becomes defined through the drive. One aspect of this which is of particular interest here is what this scopic drive is attempting to achieve. As Lacan puts it: 'What the voyeur is looking for and finds is merely a shadow, a shadow behind the curtain. There he will phantasize any magic of presence' (Lacan 1986: 182). This is very much a description that can be applied to cinema. The images presented are shadows which become invested with different properties by the spectator. This is an issue to which we shall return in a later chapter; for the moment we shall turn our attention to love and, to commence, with the kiss.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Kiss</em></h3>
        <p>The kiss operates as a declarative sign of love, and as such should enjoy a certain stability. The kiss, after all, functions to confirm love, to show love, to signify love. Yet, in all of these operations and declarations, the kiss also has a 'darker' side; for every cinematic kiss that closes the film and signifies 'love' (or more a notion of true love, as discussed below), there are other kisses which destabilise perceptions and knowledges, run counter to the epistemes of the text, and challenge the character's and our own capacity as readers to generate certainty and meaning. Herein lies the operation of the cinematic kiss, for it is at the same time both absolutely certain and fixed, and always uncertain and fluid. To some extent this is a generically determined reading process. The kiss <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in film noir</em> is destabilising and dangerous, and the spectator recognises this function, moving it from a signification of love, to one of seduction and betrayal;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a2"><a href="#fn:a2">2</a></sup> just as the kiss in the Romance genre often carries with it a sense of confirming love. Yet in both these genres the kiss brings with it an instability of certain knowledges (about events within the film, about love, about the meaning of the kiss itself) that has been challenged. The kiss in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Double Indemnity</em> (Wilder 1944) between Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson would seem to have, as its underlying intent, deception and power, and yet the spectator is encouraged to read it otherwise, as having some quality of (romantic) love attached to it. Similarly any kiss between Cathy and Heathcliff, in all the film versions of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wuthering Heights</em>, or between Rick and Ilsa in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em>, are read not simply as a confirming of love, but a reminder of the problems that such a love contains. So it is with the kiss between Finn and Sam at the end of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">How to Make an American Q,uilt</em> (Moorhouse 1995); it comes just prior to Finn's voice-over about her doubts and certainties of marriage, signalling both her return to the relationship and a sense of awareness about what might be involved. This kiss is marked against the one that does not take place between her and Leon in the truck in the fields. This absence of a kiss which signifies, essentially, a disruption of the romantic ideal of love (and a connotative value of disregarding the conservatism of tradition and marriage - in short, the irresponsible kiss of passion against the expected kiss of marriage) allows the other kiss to confirm her love for one man and not the other, <em>yet</em> there is still the undercurrent of ambiguity. Such polysemic readings and dangers are sometimes integral to the narrative itself (such as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em>  and romance films), and this difficulty of reading the kiss becomes part of its attraction. The fatal love in, for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Grifters</em> (Frears 1990) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Prizzi's Honour</em> (Huston 1985) is continually posited as part of the relationship between the characters - and the kiss reminds us and them of this, rather than usurping it.</p>
        <p>What this suggests is nothing especially surprising, for the kiss is notoriously difficult to understand, and even more difficult to fix with any certainty. For a signifier that is supposed to confirm, the kiss is fundamentally unstable in its meaning structures. This instability is part of its function both narratively speaking and in terms of the spectator's relationship to his/her cultural contexts. The signifier of the kiss almost invariably leads elsewhere, always towards another set of connotations and events. This is why something like the kiss provides us with an insight into how certain cinematic epistemologies operate within cultural contexts. How, for instance, does the spectator make sense of cinematic signs, and how does he/she cope with their instabilities? This quality of instability is derived from at least three sources that can be illustrated through the kiss: the resistance to knowledge; the kiss as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance;</em> the drive towards resolution.</p>
        <p>The kiss operates outside of knowledge, no matter how carefully it has been mapped and coded. Even though popular culture abounds with notions that the kiss confirms or denies love, and it is to the kiss that the lover most often refers as a defining moment of love, there is always an underlying insecurity on the part of the lover (and spectator) in his/her capabilities to actually understand the kiss. Part of this is contextual, for the diegetic and extra-diegetic elements contribute to the instability as much as they might confirm any interpretations. It is also to do with the cultural construction of the kiss as a sign that extends beyond its own parameters. This is especially true of those moments in film where the act of kissing is foregrounded as a defining moment of subjectivities and cultural orders/ideologies. Some examples will help illustrate this.</p>
        <p>One type of the foregrounded kiss is where the character(s) are being redefined in their subjectivities and the kiss marks the moment of transgression and/or metamorphosis. This often takes place in films dealing with a character's questioning of his/her sexuality. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">When Night is Falling</em> (Rozema 1995) invests the kiss with both resolution and further ambiguities, for it is the initially tenuous kiss between the two women that suggests that Camille, the conservative professor of Calvinist religion, is beginning to acknowledge her own decisions about her subjectivity defined through sexuality. As is often the case in such scenarios, with any sense of resolution there are also further ambiguities and questionings. Compare similar kisses in, for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lianna</em> (Sayles 1983), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Desert Heart</em> (Deitch 1985), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Personal Best</em> (Towne 1982), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Beautiful Laundrette</em> (Frears 1985), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunger</em> (Scott 1983), where the instability of the redefining subjectivities is manifested in the kiss itself. In all these cases the pursuit of some sense of knowledge about the self (and the formation of the subject position) is channelled into a need/desire to confirm sexuality. This is almost invariably located within a conflict between the subject's sense of the self, and the cultural order of sexuality and morality. However, the kiss actually destabilises, creating further issues to be dealt with. These are kisses that necessarily disquiet and unsettle.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason this takes place is that so much is invested into a single moment - the kiss on the screen becomes a synecdoche of nothing less than a redefining of what that subject's relationship to himself/herself and the cultural order is. In this we witness further the relationship between the filmic kiss and culture. Most, if not all, such kisses are problematic to the character because he/she must reflect on the cultural ramifications of the changes that such a kiss signifies. The kiss between Camille and Petra in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">When Night is Falling</em> symbolises a turning away from heterosexuality, marriage, and a Christian morality; the kiss between Johnny and Omar in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Beautiful Laundrette</em> is a resistance to the ethics of the Anglo-Indian community as well as the type of masculinity enforced in the violent world of gangs; the kiss between Vivienne and Cay in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Desert Hearts</em> involves giving up the security of a socially respected teaching profession; the incestuous kiss in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Close My Eyes</em> (Poliakoff 1991) signals the willingness and knowledge of brother and sister that they will transgress the social edicts. All of these films declare their social agenda, so can the same be said of something like the kiss between Deneuve and Sarandon in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Hunger</em> which operates more firmly in the genre of vampire and fantasy, so that the social agendas are much less overt? At one level the difference is invested in narrative ramifications (if the character does this, then he/she will be radically changed in the social status of themselves and in relation to others) as distinct from the same sorts of actions taking place in different cultural contexts. However, the kiss still carries the connotative values of a resistance to knowledge, as well as an investment in a certain type of knowledge of the self-reflexive subject, and instability whether it is located in a form of social realism or the fantastic. All of this, in turn, positions the spectator in an interesting site of hypocrisis, formulating certain knowledges and questioning others.</p>
        <p>Such kisses (and it is noteworthy that all these examples are concerned with a gay and lesbian theme) also demonstrate the operation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">differance</em>. Clearly the attribute that distinguishes these kisses is difference, in this case the difference of same gender (other examples might include race and class, which is the case with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">My Beautiful Laundrette)</em>. The act of the kiss is not different in itself (still lips and tongues coming together), and often its representation, although emphasised (through extreme closeups or slow motion), is not different. Nor should we take the easy route and say that the difference is in the fact that it is two men or two women that are kissing. The difference of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">diffirance</em> in such kisses is invested in the transformation of subjectivities as they are located within cultural contexts. This is what makes these kisses distinct from those emphasising the sexual, such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bound</em> (Warchowski Bros. 1996), where the difference of the subject in his/her cultural context is often absent, replaced instead with an investment in the erotic.</p>
        <p>The other part of <em>differance</em> in this equation is the deferral of any resolutions of both sexuality and love. The first kiss, foregrounded and isolated, usually marks a crisis point that defers any sense of confirming pleasure or security. Instead we often find guilt and an emphasis on a sense of transgression. This deferral operates within the cultural contexts of both the filmic order and the wider diegetic orders of production and reception. The kiss as cinematic signifier is particularly good at playing this role, for in every moment when it declares love as unbounded and never-ending, there is an equal force which problematises and stretches beyond the act and into an unknown future. In such cases the kiss cannot resolve, it can only make promises, some of which are never fulfilled. This is the kiss as it defers meanings, constantly leading to points as yet unseen or negotiated. The idea of the temporal nature of the kiss illustrates this. At what point do we acknowledge that the kiss has taken place? In the anticipation (and where does this start? When the characters first meet? When they acknowledge each other? In the moment before physical contact is made? Or even within the generic field which provides the initial frame of interpretation?); in the actual contact of skin on skin; in the after-effects as they shape the future of the lovers? Similarly, the power structures of the kiss create ambiguities and questions. How does one distinguish between the kissing and the kissed? Is there a sense of gift, submission, power, or control? Such questions shape the future relationships, as well as the redefining of the subject positions of the characters and the spectators.</p>
        <p>Another factor in the <em>differance</em> of the kiss is that culturally (and by this is also implied cinematically) the kiss is used to connote change. It is often positioned as a catalyst, driving the amatory economy, the characters and diegetic formations into new orders. Such kisses signify an alteration in the social order as well as the character's own subjectivity, for nothing remains the same afterwards. It is more than acknowledging love or passion, it is a point of transition which will often mark a transgression of the social order (and consequently often discontent). When Vincent, in the scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> where he stands looking at himselfin the mirror of Mia's bathroom, states that he is involved in a moral dilemma he cannot mean the morality of the social order which provides and maintains the law - for that is a moral code long since abandoned by him. He must instead be referring to that same moral and ethical code system that opens the film; is it morally correct to have someone thrown out of a window because of a possible or potential sexual indiscretion? Vincent is more concerned with his own moral structures - and preservation of life - than what the cultural order may determine as acceptable. In terms of the model of the drive referred to earlier, Vincent's return through the arc of the loop is away from those ethics he sets himself, and then back again. Interestingly, this is quite a different trajectory to what we see operating in Jules, whose action of the loop is determined by the spiritual revelation of being saved from the bullets. His drive is firstly outwards in an antimonial fashion, and then back towards a culturally sanctioned life. Vincent, in this moment in front of the mirror, is engaging in a moral code that exists extropically. This is the ethics that Lacan speaks of when he states: 'Moral action is grafted on to the real. It introduces something new into the real and thereby opens a path in which the point of our presence is legitimised' (Lacan 1992: 21). The moral reflections of Vincent at this point reveal the process of the grafting on to the Real because it is the only time we witness any sense of moral deliberation by him - and it is a deliberation centred initially, and finally, on the kiss. For all the other times he is seemingly devoid of any moral direction.</p>
        <p>The absence of a passionate kiss between Vincent and Mia is significant because it marks a particular inflection of their relationship. (The closest they come to a kiss is the one blown to Mia by Vincent, and even then her back is turned.) On the one hand it signifies a diachronic moment - that they have not yet reached (and possibly never will reach) the confession of love. It can also be seen to be acting in a synecdochic fashion, indicating the type of relationship they are engaged in. In one sense conservative social codes indicate that the kissless relationship is not romantic, and therefore either platonic or invested more in lust than love. It also gives us an avenue back to the qualities of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> cinema, which <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> seems to play with.</p>
        <p>Within the generic structure of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> cinema, with its convolutions of morality and ethics and its constant playing with ambiguities and gender politics, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> picks up these ideas and caresses them along. Vincent is the killer, the efficient and dependable agent of violence. For him death is not the issue, it is simply the following and enacting of a system of law. Witness when the gun accidentally goes off in the car, killing the teenage boy in the back seat. There is no shock for him, no disbelief that a relative innocent has just been brutally slain. The death is meaningless - it is a pulp fiction death. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> death does have a meaning - often the entire sequence of events and character interrelationships is based around a death or the possibility of one - yet the meaning exists outside of that death. It is, as far as the death itself goes, just as meaningless. The killing is only ever invested with meaning through the supplements of morality, passion, and gender. This is also why the kiss is such a volatile signifier in this genre. Because so much is invested in mistrust (to double dealings bound, as Shakespeare put it), then the ambiguity of the kiss makes it the almost perfect <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> signifier. The effects of this - the ambiguities, the emphasis on misreadings, the divergences of the loop in the drive - on the spectator, and the broader notion of the cultural order of reception, is part of the positionality of love and its discourses in the relationship between film and culture. Another point where this takes place is the cultural idea of true love.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">True Love/Breathless Love</em></h3>
        <p>The cultural construction and attitude towards a concept such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">true</em> love, and film's role in such matters, are part of the wider cultural discourse on love specifically, and the relationships between film and culture. Film has become one of the dominant textual forms in presenting a cultural discourse of love as it constantly performs, creates, and deliberates on acts of love. The idea of true love serves here to illustrate further such relationships between a cultural paradigm and its textual manifestations. The 'true', 'truth', etc. are difficult and complex enough in themselves, but when they are combined with something as equally complex as love, the difficulties are only increased. For the construction of'true love' seems to be initially motivated by a need or desire to resolve a certain type offeeling - a love greater than other forms, because it is true. But the contiguity of the terms more often than not actually draws attention to the problematic nature of both 'true' and 'love'.</p>
        <p>As with the kiss, true love is supposed to confirm the existence, direction, and function of the amatory economy, place events and people within a frame of reference that is constant and discernible, operating, as it does, through cultural constructions. Yet there are always elements of instability and slippage that make its very status problematic. Textually speaking this is not unique to cinema, having a long tradition in other textual forms. Two issues that perhaps make <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> different are its fundamental position in the formation and representation of love in culture, and that it has developed at a time when there has been a fundamental questioning of notions of truth and meaning. Truth, as Lacan says, 'is a word of ill repute, a word banished from polite society' (Lacan 1985: 120), which is certainly a reflection on the modernist/postmodernist and poststructuralist philosophies of the twentieth century. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> accommodates and contributes to the amatory discourses because of its position (as popular, as 'art', as diverse, etc.) in culture, which includes the performance of love and the deconstruction of it. The configuration of true love is often one read in reverse - that it is the love part that confirms the sense of 'true' - rather than what might at first appear to be the case. This has certain cultural and ideological implications, for in this sense truth is confirmed through the amatory economy.</p>
        <p>Another part of the equation of the cultural construction of true love is sacrifice, and it is the depth of that willingness to surrender that which is most desired - often the love itself - which demonstrates love. This again is part of the generic formation of high Romance, and its durability is due in no small part to the cathexis of emotions involved. To illustrate this we can consider how a film such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> constructs, and draws on, the idea of true love in order to formulate specific cultural positions and interpretations, for it is very much a text located within the long tradition of high Romance.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> sets up the need for sacrifice from its very opening moments, even if the desire for it comes later. The stasis of the city, of the world, is what defines every action and every character. It is only through some form of sacrifice that changes can be brought into this world order. There are at least five manifestations of this romantic notion of love as sacrifice: (i) the sacrifice of one's personal feelings of love for love; (ii) the personal sacrifice for world peace; (iii) the sacrifice of history and the past for the future, as well as a sacrifice of certain choices for the future; (iv) the sacrifice of truth (Rick's obvious lie of 'She doesn't love me' is still such a sacrifice, even ifit is acknowledged as false); (v) the sacrifice of desire for love. The sorts of demands made within this order of sacrifice is a classic romantic agenda - of the individual for the other, which includes another person, group of people, social order, or ideal. In short, the sacrifices are directed primarily towards a cultural order outside of the self. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> the sacrifices are seen in terms of the world community.</p>
        <p>To read this underlying ideological current of the social order that requires sacrifice through love we can turn to Kristeva. Part of her (philosophical) concerns are for an interpretation of Hegel's and Heidegger's notions of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>, or care, and how this operates in the formation of the social subject. We can note that the representation of these forms of love in films such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> (that is, high Romance) is a manifestation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>, as well as a demonstration of cinema's contribution to this in the social order. In other words, by representing care as a social need, films also participate in the social construction of this ideology. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cura</em> is the 'basis on which <em class="notranslate" translate="no">every</em> interpretation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dasein</em> [Heidegger's term for Beingness] which is on tic and belongs to the world order' (Kristeva l 984b: 128). This is precisely the sense we find in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> - each character's sense of worth and beingness comes to be invested in their capacity to demonstrate <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>, which is sharply contrasted with the Nazi (and Vichy) ideology.</p>
        <p>We can trace the manifestation of the ideology of care even further by considering another passage from Kristeva: 'Care is the repression of social practice as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">objective</em> practice, and its replacement by the resigned expectation of a meaning - social or transcendental - always anticipated, never attained ... The subject then attributes meaning to the world, which he thereafter considers a corollary to himself, a kind of system of signification' (Kristeva l 984b: 130). This is the ideology of love in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em>. Taking each point in terms of the film, we see:</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The repression of social practice</em> The social practice is always subjective due to the repression of the idea of the objective, for each character intervenes in the social world order through their acts of love and sacrifice. It is the personal, subjective intervention that challenges the abject ideology of Nazism.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The resigned expectation of meaning</em> Each character is resigned to an expectation of meaning - indeed, each act of love is seen as a socialised form of meaning. Love is used to make sense of the world; it is contrasted with the meaningless, unchanging world of Casablanca. (It is also noteworthy that Kristeva's 'expectation of meaning' involves a sense of the temporal - something Casablanca lacks until love as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em> is invested in it.)</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Social and transcendental acts</em> Meaning through love's sacrifice in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> is both social and transcendental. The actions of Rick, Ilsa, and Victor all involve a combination of social and transcendental meanings (and we can add the final acts of Captain Renault to this list as well). This means that the (romantic/sexual) love for the other becomes the love for freedom, peace, noble ideals, and virtue through the enacting of sacrifice, which is <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>. This, in turn, is fed back into the love for the other in a cycle typical of romance ideology. But such a cycle means that, just as Kristeva points out, the meaning is never attained. The actions of love and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>, through these personal sacrifices, are what allow meaning to be attributed to the world, which is then part of the self. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> this is demonstrated by the world order becoming meaningful to Rick only after he asserts his sense of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>. This is also what Marxist theory sees as the anchoring of the subject to the mechanisms of the State. It is Rick's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em> (which here comes to stand for both sacrifice and love) that relocates him back into the ideology of the cultural order - an action we witnessed in the same manner (but with quite different qualities) with the loop of the drive of Jules in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em>. The choices presented to Rick, in particular, revolve around the romantic and the political/ideological. He can have one or the other, but not both. Somewhat ironically, the fact that he chooses the political over the romantic ends up repositioning him as a romantic hero within the wider cultural order; the character becomes an icon of the romantic hero in Classical Hollywood cinema. It would seem that at one level Ilsa, as a woman, is denied such choice; it is men who make decisions about world politics, ideological struggles, and even love. This is overtly stated in the scene where she tells Rick to think for both of them. She seems to be placed as an antithetical companion to politics, caught between the desiring gaze of two men - <em>one</em> an empty moraliser, the other an impotent father. At another level (or perhaps more accurately from a different interpretative stance) she is a much more active agent than either of the two men, again through this ideology of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>. It is she who exerts power over them, possessing far more knowledge (a bout the men and the past) than either of them. She is also far more causal than the men, offering a sense of action within a social order seen largely as deterministic. Compared to the narcissistic musings of the men, she is the one who allows a manifestation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em> to take place. The centrality of her in terms of the exchange of the two letters reveals this.</p>
        <p>The exchange of letters is based on a system of power and knowledge, gift and denial. The control of the letters becomes part of the manifestation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>. For as each letter is given and then denied, denied then given, there is a demonstration of sacrifice which is directly tied to the social construction of love. Each of these acts is motivated through love, just as each one becomes more than its initial signifier of escape. And central to all these exchanges is Ilsa.</p>
        <p>The sense of the gift in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em> is a common feature in romance, and this film interweaves the other ideologies into this signifier so that it becomes part of the scenario of sacrifice and love. It is worth comparing it to another film that utilises this structure only to undermine it. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Manon des sources</em> there is a series of ritualistic gift givings, some intended as love, others interpreted that way. The circle involves three characters: Manon, U golin, and the teacher. U golin leaves birds in Manon's traps to signify his love - a series of gifts that become undone when he clumsily declares his love through the prompting of his uncle. Manon gives the lost knife back to the teacher, which is a gift to show her interest in him; and he gives it back, which is a gift exchange that Ugolin observes and becomes distressed over. The final gift is one that is not intended, and becomes a signifier of Ugolin's madness. Manon's hair ribbon is found by Ugolin and then sewn on to his breast in a scene that is eerily silent and visually disturbing. These gifts are not of the same order of sacrifice that are postulated in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em>, yet they come to signify the same sorts of love. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cura</em> finds no ready place in these loves, in part because the entire narrative is centred on a culturally corrupted order. The village, including Manon, are still living the consequences of the events portrayed in earlier years (and shown in the earlier film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Jean de Florette</em> (Berri 1986)). The water Manon gives to the village is part of this system, and yet is also the one real manifestation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>. For this reason it is the gift which locates her back in the social order, giving, as noted in Kristeva earlier, meaning to the world order, as well as making it a corollary to the self. The initial images of Manon as a wild, primitive and ethereal spirit, unable or unwilling to engage in speech, give way to the socially inscribed repositioning of her (through dress, language, and the adoption of social conventions, including romance and love) .</p>
        <p>The gift, like the kiss, is revealed to have an investment in portraying love, but possesses too much ambiguity to do so without confusion. In his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Given Time</em>, Derrida investigates the idea of the gift, commencing with a proposition vital to his concerns: 'the gift is the impossible. Not impossible but the impossible. The very figure of the impossible. It announces itself, gives itself to be thought as the impossible' (Derrida 1994: 7). Part of the reason for the impossibility of the gift for Derrida is that it must be a part of the economy of our culture, and yet always remains outside of it. Any gift, argues Derrida, can never be given without incurring a sense of debt,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a3"><a href="#fn:a3">3</a></sup> and places us within a circular pattern of 'payment and discharge of debt' (Derrida 1994: 12). This is also part of what Derrida sees as the negation of the gift once it is given and acknowledged: 'There is no more gift as soon as the other <em class="notranslate" translate="no">receives</em> - and even if she refuses the gift that she has perceived or recognized as gift. As soon as she keeps for the gift the signification of gift, she loses it, there is no more <em class="notranslate" translate="no">gift'</em> (Derrida 1994: 14-15). Inourlanguage - including that of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> - thegiftand the kiss are strongly entwined. We speak, for example, of giving someone a kiss, and of receiving one. It has become part of the ideology of the exchange. Similarly, the gifts in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Manon des sources</em> incur debts, even if the participants are not a ware that an exchange of gifts has taken place. Furthermore, once they become aware of the gifts, each of the signifiers of the gift is altered in its meaning. In some ways these gifts, with their sense of debt, contain transgressive qualities; each contains an element which requires the giver to relinquish part of their subjectivity (Manon's secrecy, Ugolin's confessions of his love).</p>
        <p>The idea of a transgressive gift of love is demonstrated in quite a different fashion in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les TeuxSans Visage (Eyes Without a Face)</em> (Franju 1959). The story of a surgeon who kidnaps women so that he can remove their face in order to sew it on to his daughter (who was disfigured in an accident), is constructed as horrific. Yet all of his actions are presented as motivated through love, even if this is a version of perverse love ultimately driving towards madness. The film replicates this action with the doctor's assistant who, through her love for him, helps trap the victims. Love drives the horror, but it is always preserved as the amatory gift even at its most abject. The abject gift of love (another woman's face, the sewing of the ribbon into Ugolin's breast) presents overtly these attributes of the impossibility of the gift. They also present an antithetical model to the romantic notion of love and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura</em>, for the abject love is also antisocial in its actions and results. However this impossibility is not always so abject, and often underlies the whole scenario of love as gift. The exchanges we witness in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em>, for exam pie, signify the same sorts of impossibility without the terror.</p>
        <p>This relationship of ideology to love (in this example true love formulated through <em class="notranslate" translate="no">cura)</em> is, of course, far more diverse than is found in high Romance. We have, for example, already seen the complexity of the kiss once it is invested with a sense of otherness and social transgression. Our final example will show how these aspects can operate within these ideological orders, and yet also transgress them. This is the version of true love found in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souffle</em>. Even the film's title - breathless - suggests both its form and themes; this is a breathless rendition of breathless love! In these terms it is a love closer <em class="notranslate" translate="no">tojouissance</em> than the romantic for it is driven by a certain passion, even in its moments of tenderness. Interestingly, this sort of division is what is found in both Freud and Lacan when they discuss the drive and love; as Lacan puts it: 'On one side, Freud puts the partial drives and on the other love ... The drives necessitate us in the sexual order - they come from the heart' (Lacan 1986: 189). The drives in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souffle</em> carry the events and characters, particularly Michel whose actions are motivated by a type of excessive desire that overrides social and personal constraints. His <em class="notranslate" translate="no">jouissance</em> positions him outside of the Symbolic order, unsettling and disrupting the conventions. In this way he is a motif of the whole <span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Wave</span> movement, which was a type of cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">jouissance</em> as it openly transgressed the established discourses of narrative cinema. Love sits between acts <em class="notranslate" translate="no">of jouissance</em> (such as pure passion) and its Symbolic manifestations.</p>
        <p>In many ways <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souf]le</em> is a classical love story in its themes, but it deconstructs this in its emphasis on the differences of love. Here the male, Michel, is seen as excessively sexual, passionate and socially irresponsible - an antithesis of Rick and Victor in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Casablanca</em>. Patricia is invested with these responsibilities, including nurturing and motherhood. This observation of the traditions of a form in order to disrupt them is typical of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Wave</span> films, and in particular Godard. Although Truffaut is less extravagant in this issue, many of his films still portray disruptions of these systems of representing love. The development of Antoine Doinel in the series of films <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les 400 coups</em> (1959), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L'Amour a vingt ans</em> ( 1962), <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Baisers votes</em> (1968), and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Domicile co, Yugal</em> ( 1970) demonstrates a cycle of the character's movement in and out of positions of responsibility, almost always instigated by issues of love and passion. A different sort of example, still from the French <span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Wave</span>, is Jean-Pierre Melville's film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Samourai</em> (1967), which takes the emotions out of its lead figure, only so that it can represent his social and personal unravelling through the intervention of love.</p>
        <p>The very masculine perspective that many of these films are derived from often led to a construction of love that was threatening and violent. Lacan, in dealing with the issue of transference in psychoanalysis, voices this sort of process in terms of the other: 'I love you, but, because inexplicably I love in you something more than you - the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">objet petit a</em> - I mutilate you' (Lacan 1986: 248). Such mutilation in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A bout de souffle</em> takes place on a number of levels: Michel treats Patricia terribly, often with arrogance, partly because he doesn't understand others generally, but women particularly.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a4"><a href="#fn:a4">4</a></sup> Patricia wants to be free - she states this quite literally - but her freedom is tied up with the death of Michel - a death which is presented in quite a comical way. His mutilation through love is directly physical. We certainly don't respond to it as ifit is tragedy - especially when Patricia adopts Michel's Bogartesque swipe of the lips. This comic underpinning once more shows how the film sets up the conventions of high Romance, only in order to undercut them.</p>
        <p>Michel Mourlet, in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Wave</span>'s own journal <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cahiers du Cinema</em>, wrote an essay entitled 'In Defence of Violence' which begins: 'Violence is a major theme in aesthetics. Past or present, latent or active, it is of its nature at the heart of every creative act, even at the moment it is being denied' (Mourlet 1986: 132); later he adds that '<span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is the art most attuned to violence'. The actual conceptual points being made here are of less interest than the fact that they are made within this context. It could never be argued that the films of the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Wave</span> were especially violent, or even that they demonstrated an aesthetics of violence (as we might wish to argue is the case with Peckinpah, Tarantino, John Woo, or Scorsese). Mourlet's argument, furthermore, is not specifically directed towards the <em class="notranslate" translate="no"><span class="notranslate" translate="no">New Wave</span></em>, but to <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> overall. The important point is that this essay, and others like it, does reveal something of the position of violence for that cinematic (and theoretical) group. In these terms we circle back to an ideological function of the representation of love. Michel's death may well be somewhat parodic, but it is still a signifier filmed with a certain fluidity, tied to an act of love. It also captures another part of Lacan's commentary on love when he states: 'Love rarely comes true, as each of us knows, and it only lasts for a time' (Lacan 1983: 170).</p>
        <p>This last line from Lacan is, of course, a nod to the cultural construction of love. It comes from a Lacan who acknowledges the positioning of love is both psychical and cultural. What we observe from all this is that cinema's investment in love is part of a largely cultural order, and any investigation of it leads us to an analysis of the widerissues of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and ideology. The example of love is quite specific - even if it covers a wide and diverse set of issues - but it does serve as an example of how <em>we</em> might approach cinema's cultural and ideological connections. We shall pursue more of these issues in the following chapter, which has as one of its primary concerns cinema's capacity for social disruption.</p>
