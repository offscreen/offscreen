Once more, we find ourselves confronted with a familiar entanglement. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself is seductive - this is one of its most compelling qualities; and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has become well practised and skilled at setting up and devising scenes of seduction. To investigate the sorts of relationships which operate between <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> and seduction we need to bear this aspect in mind. The seductive power of the cinematic apparatus has become one of its defining features. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is seduction, and to watch a film is to be seduced. This is true in the very specific sense of a seductive image (or sound, or sequence, and so on), and it is also true in a much broader sense in that all <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> seduces through the very act of spec ta ting. In this sense the gaze is a relationship of seduction, and the film is what draws it in, luring it by its qualities and its representations. The seduced spectator is constructed by, and constructs, the film. Even from this simple line we can note that much of what follows will trace back through a great deal of what has gone before. Seduction may well be a metaphor here, bu tit does offer the chance to circle back, and to contemplate some of the essential features of film in terms of the construction of the spectator through the cinema’s gaze, the cultural contexts of film, the creation and function of cinematic discourses, and the opera ti on of meaning. In each of these we find seduction.</p>
        <p>The themes and processes of seduction surround us. What we tend to experience, however, is much less seduction and more its effects. This is partly because to attempt to describe a unity of seduction, or even a materiality, is an impossibility. Seduction is not limited to certain formal features and textual practices, but rather it is a quality that can be seen to be operating at any number of different levels, both in the broadest sense of the phenomenon, and within specific aspects of film. It is what lies beneath the surface that most often contains the seductive qualities and lures. Seduction that declares itself as such is perhaps the least seductive, for with that comes an overt statement of what is taking place. Seduction is about deception, and as such must always resist truth. To say that something is seduction is really to say that it opposes the truth, resists conclusion: ’To be seduced is to be turned from one’s truth. To seduce is to lead the other from his/her truth’ (Baudrillard 1990: 81). It could be said that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> also has a certain investment in such seductions. In order to work towards an idea of how seduction works in cinema, and how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself operates at a level of seduction, we shall commence with a few observations on the elements of the seductive and how they interact. We shall begin by considering the idea of the difference between signs of seduction and seductive signs.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Signs of Seduction and the Seductive Sign</h3>
        <p>Cinematic signs which operate as the seductive can be divided into two types: the seductive signs and the signs of seduction. The seductive signs are those types which have their seductive quality invested in the signifier, and their primary function is to seduce towards themselves. Such signs have an attraction to the signifier itself. The most obvious examples occur in forms such as propaganda films, where the intent of the signs is to produce a type of political seduction. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Triumph of the Will</em> does this with its shots of the Nuremberg rallies, where the images of the masses of people are set up to seduce at first the gaze and then the political will of the spectator. That they now have such chilling resonance, totally devoid of any sense of seduction, is a result of history and political knowledge. Similarly, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Battleship Potemkin</em> attempts political seduction through its recurring seductive signifiers (the masses against the soldiers, and the lone mother and child in the Odessa steps sequence, for example). In both these examples from the right and left of the political spectrum we see seductive signs, where the quality of being seduced is held at the level of the signifier.</p>
        <p>The creation of the star system, which invests actors with the attributes of seduction, is a different form of this same process. Certain actors become noted for parts of their body, which work in effect as seductive signs. The voice of John Malkovich, the lips of Bardot, the fetishistic hair of Jane Fonda in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Barbarella</em> (Vadim 1968), the sculpted muscles of Bruce Willis, the postwar curves (so much a conflation of masculine desire for the sexual and the mother) of Marilyn Monroe, the dark eyes of Gregory Peck in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Spellbound</em> (Hitchcock, 1945), the generational desires represented in Winona Ryder, are all examples of seductive signs because <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> constructs them to attract the gaze, or some other part of the sensory perceptions such as the ear, of the spectator. They come to signify seduction in themselves and can do this without recourse to other signifying practices. In doing so they have a declarative effect, and once this is established seduction proceeds at the denotative level, with the only question left being as to what the seduction is towards - although with the majority of such signs the answer to this is invariably to the signs themselves.</p>
        <p>Such signs contain a direct action within themselves to resist any attempt to look too far beyond the signifying levels of denotation. The reason for this is that seductive signs are emptied of connotative value because they want to signify seduction itself. This is in direct contrast to signs of seduction, for these attempt to resist being seen as seductive at all. Instead, these signs present deceptively simple signifiers and invest the element of seduction in the signified. These signs have an attraction beyond the signifier, and often beyond the sign itself. What comes into play with such signs is that there is a constant questioning of whether or not seduction is taking place; or ifit is, to what effect and for what reasons. Signs of seduction are often recognised as such only after their effects have been felt.</p>
        <p>Many signs cross over <em>between</em> these two broad types, and it would be wrong to see this as an attempt to categorise in a binary fashion. To return to an earlier example, the images in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Triumph of the Will</em> and the pout of Bardot do want to seduce, and do declare this (both in themselves and within a broader cultural context). However, the seduction also attempts to take place at a level beyond the signifier - at the level of fascism for one and male sexuality for the other. But what makes these more seductive signs (than signs of seduction) is that there is no real disguising of this, and their seduction operates at the level of complicity. The propositional and modal opacity of these seductive signs is decreased because of this declarative process. Indeed, part of the very seduction is this investment in a self-awareness so that the spectator becomes the willing participant. Signs of seduction, on the other hand, may not even appear especially seductive initially, but usually this quality is revealed at some point. This post-seduced revelation is a common theme in, for example, films of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em>, thrillers and mystery. The dynamics of the operation of the cinematic signs can be read in terms of these two types, especially when the force of the code is brought into play. Before turning to this let us take a couple of examples to tease out some more attributes of these sign systems.</p>
        <p>Seductive signs tend to be heavily invested with a sort of cultural currency. We quickly recognise them because they declare their intent and utilise well-established paradigms, drawn from cultural sensibilities, history, intertextual references, textual conventions, etc. We can take a scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pulp Fiction</em> to illustrate this, in part because it parodies some of the key aspects of a certain form of cultural and filmic established seductions, and in doing so holds up the devices in a type of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em> logic.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The First Scene of Seduction - Power /Knowledge</em></h3>
        <p>The sequence we are most interested in here is the one which commences with the arrival of Vincent at Mia’s house to take her out on a date, to the closing scene of their return from the diner and her accidental overdose. This is a set of scenes which draws together a parody of 1950s teenage films of dating, with all their repressed and highly encoded seductions, and a 1990s postmodernist discarding of moral structures and sensibilities of innocence. The setting of the 1950s diner utilises the connotative values of innocence, family life, and sexual clumsiness in direct contrast to elements such as the powerful, dominant figure of the woman (Mia), the open use of drugs (the parodic doubling is well illustrated when Mia uses the euphemism that she has to go and ’powder her nose’ only to be shown snorting cocaine in the mirror), and the constant threat of violence. It is this contrast of ideologies and attitudes from the 1950s and 1990s that makes the elements of seduction adhere to and, at the same time, challenge many of the filmic conventions.</p>
        <p>This is a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scene</em> of seduction which contains both seductive signs and signs of seduction; and one of the clearest seductions is Mia over Vincent. At one level he seems quite incapable of realising the seduction is taking place. Various parts of Mia’s body are emphasised in this role of seduction: her hair is vampish Louise Brookes, her fingers impossibly long, her lips are emphasised in shape and colour, and her gaze is direct and constant. All the while Vincent seems oblivious to these elements. One of the key elements of seduction is power, for no seduction can work without it. The power of one person over another can be distilled into any number of different structures; love, sex, desire, and passion are the most obvious and recurring ones, but there are many others. This is the same sort of power that is bound up to knowledge in a Foucauldian sense. Mia’s power/knowledge contains many seductive signs to the spectator - it is an inherent part of her character, established long before we meet her, when she is discussed by Vincent and Jules in terms of the throwing of the man out of the window. The first representations of her are located purely within a cultural sense of seduction - the closeup of her lips, a voice which surrounds intimately like a whisper, a gaze (through a surveillance camera) that renders her more powerful because she knows and sees more than others. To this, Vincent’s seeming naivety lacks seduction. His wandering gaze, his drug induced semi-stupor, his incapacity to speak (and speech is so often a fundamental part of the seduction process), his childlike mannerisms (the disbelief of a ’five dollar shake’ and the use of adolescent expressions for example), all seem to position him outside of the adult world of seduction.</p>
        <p>Mia’s seductive qualities are based almost entirely on seductive signs - a fairly typical representation of women within a phallocular world order. Vincent does seduce, but his are more signs of seduction. He does have some seductive signs, most coming in the dance scene where, for the first time, he sustains a seductive gaze equal to Mia’s.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1">1</a></sup> He is also more aware of the seduction than at first seems likely, or even possible; when they return to Mia’s house he stands in front of the bathroom mirror and points out the ethical dilemma he is confronted with, arguing that the safest and most moral line to adopt is to have a quick drink, say goodnight, and then home to ’jerk off’ - an action on his behalfintended to defuse the seductive signs. Given this, the power/knowledge of Vincent in the scene of seduction is operating beyond the denotative signifiers, and at a level of the signs of seduction.</p>
        <p>Both seductive signs and signs of seduction necessarily operate within a code structure of seduction. The most apparent difference is that the first is more overtly recognisable as part of the code structure, whilst the second relies on this coding process to be recognised as such. In other words, whereas seductive signs have their status confirmed through coding processes, signs of seduction rely entirely on that encoding/decoding process to be understood and recognised. Signs of seduction can be almost any sign, transformed into seduction through the codes of seduction. The model below illustrates this.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Codes of Seduction produce:</p>
        <p>Sr (the signifier becomes an agent of seduction)</p>
        <p>Sd (the signified has the function of seduction)</p>
        <p>Sn (the relationship of Sr-Sd relies on a seductive process)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The first part of this model (the sign, represented as Sn) presents us with the idea that any sign exists <em class="notranslate" translate="no">in potentia</em> as seductive, and it is often embedded in certain conventions which contribute to, or resist, this attribute. Remembering that part of the agenda here is to consider how cinematic signs (that is, all films as they come to constitute the cinematic apparatus) themselves are seductive, as well as those film signs involved in the particular representation of seduction, there are certain confluences which cannot be readily represented on so schematic a diagram. We then see the three parts of the sign - its signifier (1), signified (2), and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">glissading</em> bar (3) which represents the various relationships which exist between these other two. Each of these elements (and combinations of one, two or all three elements can do this) passes through the code of seduction to produce different effects and ways of interpreting them. The signifier which is read in terms of such a code is most like the seductive sign, for its active agency is to seduce, or to represent the seduction, or, as is most often the case, a conflation of the two. Mia’s lips and Vincent’s innocence are signifiers which, read through the code of seduction, become seductive signs for each other and the spectator.</p>
        <p>In signs where the signifier is not positioned as seductive (its materiality resists this, or the context is not as clearly established) the signified can have the function of seduction, almost running counter to the operation of its signifiers. In these cases the code of seduction not only ’categorises’ such signs, it provides a system for making sense of them, and linking them to other seductive moments. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Piano</em> there is a whole series of elaborate seductions operating at the level of the signified, but resisted within the signifiers. The piano itself is a seduction - of civilisation in a colonial world, of romantic love, of speech/communication and its rejection, of the choice between the seduction of death and the possibility of happiness in life. The exchange of keys for flesh is more clearly a series of seductive signs, whereas Ada’s fierce sense of her self becomes a sign of seduction to both Stewart and Baines. At another level there are cultural seductions, with Baines physically representing a white person seduced to the Maori culture with his facial tattoos, and Stewart, with his anomalous European dress and mannerisms, representing the resistance to one form of cultural seduction (the Maori), but giving in to another (the European). But to read almost any of these signs in this way requires us to track the signified through the code of seduction, and then to reassess the signifier.</p>
        <p>The third passage we find in this model is when the bar of the sign passes through the code of seduction. In this process it is the relationship of the signifier and the signified which is reread in terms of seduction. In other words, the bar binds the two other elements together as being seductive. In this sense the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">glissement</em> of the bar, its sliding qualities, becomes fixed through the cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">point du capiton</em> of codes of seduction. A sign becomes understood as representing seduction not necessarily in itself, but by being fixed at that moment through the codes of seduction. The most obvious example of this is where either the signifier or the signified (or indeed both) seem openly resistant or oppositional to a reading of seduction. Evil as seductive, which is so deeply embedded in a great many film representations, relies on this sort of structure. (This is the same argument used against <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as having the capacity to seduce its audience into immorality.) The binding of a potentially abject signifier with an equally abject signified can only produce a seductive quality if the bar itself has been positioned in terms of a code of seduction. Michael Corleone’s turning towards violence in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Godfather</em> is construed as seductive at the level of the bar (with its feature of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">glissement</em> momentarily fixed by this reading of seduction.</p>
        <p>Codes of seduction, to sum up, have three primary functions. Firstly, they establish signifiers as seductive in their materiality. The film conventions of pouting female lips and chiselled male jaws are signifiers of seduction because of these codes. Secondly, they provide interpretations of the signified which relocate the entire sign within a context of seduction. Thirdly, they allow a binding of the elements of the sign so that it necessarily functions in terms of seduction. In order to observe more fully these operations, and engage in more detail with some of the processes of seduction, we will now consider how different genres utilise and adapt the codes and signs of seduction.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Seduction and Genre</h3>
        <p>We have already noted that one of the primary attributes of seduction is power/knowledge. But this does raise a number of difficulties. Is all seduction about power? If the participants in seduction know what is taking place (that is they have supposedly equal knowledge), is it still seduction? What happens to things like power and knowledge after the seduction has taken place? To consider these more fully this section will consider how seduction operates across a number of different film forms, commencing with the one that has one of the greatest amounts of investment in seduction, film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em>.</p>
        <p>Film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> operates with a continuous undercurrent of seduction. Its entire narrative propulsion, character development, ideological perspective, and created world order circle around the one fundamental quality that people are seductive and are seduced. These sexual, seductive relationships are quite different from those represented in erotic films, where there is not so much seduction as just stated sexual intent. Sexual fulfilment in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> is never the compulsion, but rather it is the power of the sexual over people. This is what gives <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> its darkest moments, because the actions of the seducer (more often than not the female) are derived from an investment in power/knowledge. So heavily invested in seduction are the signs of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> film that almost anything can acquire this attribute. The codes of seduction permeate all actions, objects and exchanges; but for this to operate effectively there is also an unequal distribution of knowledge. Men are generally shown to be unaware of the seduction until it is too late. They recognise the seductive signs, but not the signs of seduction, which are the ones more clearly imbued with power/knowledge. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Double Indemniry</em> the spectator’s first view of Phyllis Dietrichson is from a first person perspective of Walter Neff. We, like him, clearly recognise the seductive signs as she walks down the stairs, picking up from the closeup of her anklet, her bare legs, her almost too blond hair, the sensual clothing. This is a male perspective of what seductive signs look like, with all power seeming to be located in this scopophilic gaze. Of course the code of seduction reverses this, and the signs of seduction are fl.owing in the opposite direction; he is not being seduced by the seductive signs, but by the noirones that are operating beyond the materiality of the signifier.</p>
        <p>This double play of signs filtered through the code of seduction is a recurring theme in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> - so much so that it is one of the defining qualities of the genre itself. Even the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">neo-noir</em> films of the 1980s and 1990s, such as the remake of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Last Seduction</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Big Heat</em> (Kasden 1981), observe this process of layering seductive signs which are stated, with signs of seduction which contain the elements of power/ knowledge. It is this interplay which helps define the signs as such, and locates the characters and events within certain sexual politics. One of the biggest shifts between the original sequence of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> films and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">neo-noir</em> versions is that the women are often positioned as positive in their powerful attributes, even if there are still senses of masculine paranoia of the seductive woman. Once this takes place we begin to witness what Baudrillard describes as a seduction which has ’an ironic, alternative form, one that breaks the referentiality of sex and provides a space, not a desire, but of play and defiance’ (Baudrillard 1990: 21). In these terms, and in this space, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> films, both the originals and the later versions, provide a <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergonal</em> logic of seduction. The spectator both knows and understands the function of seduction in this film form, but occupies a site outside of this knowledge in order to let the seduction operate. This is a good example of hypocrisis, for the spectator is seduced not simply at the level of a represented seduction, but as part of the power/knowledge structure of seduction. (We shall return to Baudrillard’s reading of seduction later in this chapter and explore these ideas further.)</p>
        <p>A different type of seduction takes place in the Western and the Gangster genres, but with very similar gender politics. The sorts of seductions which operate are almost invariably not sexual in both these forms, for they are located firmly within deeply conservative and repressive sexual politics. Instead the seductions in the Western and Gangster films come primarily from two sources - violence and territory. The seduction of violence operates in a similar way to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the femme fatale</em>. The knowledge of the threat of death, the compulsion to return, the impossibility to resist, the ubiquity of the seductive signs as they come to define the social order, are as true of violence in the Wes tern and Gangster films as they are of the woman in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em>. The seduction comes in at various levels, often with initial resistance, then acceptance and deep involvement, before a tragic ending. Signifiers such as guns in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Winchester 73</em> (Mann 1950) and the knife in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Iron Mistress</em> (Douglas 1952) represent how the ’good’ man is seduced into violence. Similarly, the past and revenge operate in some ways as part of the seduction in, for example, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">High Noon. Unforgiven</em> represents a self-reflexive turn on precisely this narrative device in the Western, just as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Millers Crossing</em> does the same in terms of the Gangster film. Both films employ characters who openly discuss the seductions (and ethics) of violence, the past, and vengeance, and both find resistance is impossible. Territory, be it land in the Western or a city in the Gangster film, is positioned as equally seductive. For it is the playing out of masculine desires to possess and control that is manifested in the need for territory. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> this masculine desire for ’territory’ is the body of the woman.</p>
        <p>Seduction in the romance genre is different from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> in that it follows two broad possibilities, each derived from a certain position of power/ knowledge: it can be positive seduction and leads to love; or it is negative seduction and leads to tragedy. As with <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em>, the code of seduction preexists any films of this form, so the signs can be substantially different from film to film and the spectator can still be aware of their operations. The sustained and polymorphic attributes of these codes means that the seduction can be found in quite diverse contexts; the comic becomes part of the seduction in screwball and romantic comedies, working at this level in, for example, Hepburn and Tracy in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Adam’s Rib</em> (Cukor 1949), Gable and Colbert in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">It Happened One Night</em> (Capra 1934) and Hepburn and Grant in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Bringing Up Baby</em> (Hawks 1938). Once more we can see a sort of reflexivity of this in films that push the conventions much further as the comic stands in for seduction, and in doing so operates as part of it. What the comic allows, at the same time, is both an acknowledgment and denial that seduction is taking place. The humour of the situation places the seduction on to the comic, and vice versa. In this way the sexual repression, of which seduction is an essential part, that humour attempts to avoid is played out at the level of the comic. This displacement of the signs and codes of seduction represents a different inflection of the power/knowledge involved.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Scene of Seduction: The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Urphantasie</em> of Cinema</h3>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Second Scene of Seduction - Freedom and Phantasy</em></h3>
        <p>In a scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Easy Rider</em> a family man leans out of his car window, gazes longingly at Wyatt and Billy on their motorbikes as they pause in the traffic. Gazes meet, a few words are exchanged about how lucky they are in their freedom, and then they separate. The scene sets up a reversal of the positioning of the spectator in the film’s intentionality of seduction. This man comes to represent what the spectator (especially those in the film’s contemporary audience who could possibly think that the dream of motorbikes and freedom might exist in the latter part of the 1960s) does not want to be, and yet is. His car, like the seats of the cinema, distinguishes him from the phantasy presented by the two on the bikes. The seduction is presented as possible, but unlikely, desired yet destructive. This is a phantasy heavily invested in a (Western) cultural order, made more ironic in the <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> of Wenders (such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The American Friend</em> (1977) and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Paris, Texas</em> (1984) where the freedom of the road is revealed to be a circuitous trip of introspection and non-arrival), or Antonioni’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Passenger</em> which ends with a 360-degree panning shot, representing the impossibility of escape and resolution.</p>
        <p>Psychoanalysis has a difficult relationship to seduction, stemming largely from a theory that Freud devised, supposedly abandoned, and then seemed to keep circling around. This is his ’scene of seduction’ in which he initially argued that everyone experienced, during childhood, an attempt of seduction by an adult, which was then followed by a second scene of seduction which takes place after puberty (see Freud’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Studies on Hysteria</em>). He appears to abandon this theory, replacing it with the theory of the Oedipus complex as an explanation of the sexual development of the individual, but parts of it came to be invested in his later ideas on the development of child sexuality. Laplanche and Pontalis point out that ’it is Freud’s first and sole attempt to establish an intrinsic relationship between repression and sexuality’ (Laplanche and Pontalis 1986: 10), and as such retained a significant point in his theories. The other part to Freud’s theory of seduction and sexual development is what he called the primal scene. This is the child’s discovery of sexuality by catching the parents in the act of sex. The child, Freud argues, mistakes this as an aggressive act, and misreads orgasmic pleasure as violence. More significantly, this is the moment where adult sexuality becomes known/experienced by the child, and signals the child’s movement into the Symbolic.</p>
        <p>When Freud introduced the term <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Urphantasien</em> (primal phantasy) he did so in order to negotiate these twin difficulties of the chronological developments of phantasy, and the different types of reality involved in the conscious and unconscious. As Laplanche and Pontalis point out: ’Since it proved impossible to determine whether the primal scene is something truly experienced by the subject, or a fiction, we must in the last resort seek a foundation in something which transcends both individual experience and what is imagined’ (Laplanche and Pontalis 1986: 16). This should also provide some invaluable material in understanding how <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> operates as a scene of seduction for both the spectating subject and the cultural order.</p>
        <p>What is important for us here is contained in two related propositions: the first is the general idea that seduction works at an unconscious, as well as conscious, level; the second is that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has its own formations of a primal phantasy (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">urphantasie</em>) from which scenes of seduction are constructed and made sense of, as well as providing a type oflink to the cultural order of things. Part of this order is psychoanalysis’s distinction between realities - ’reality’ and psychical reality (discussed earlier) - and cinema’s capacity to move across the boundaries, producing signs and effects that operate in both realms.</p>
        <p>One of the more direct ways we witness a relationship between these ideas and <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is film’s role in negotiating repression and sexuality through a playing out of seduction scenes. This is quite literally a sense that <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> replicates various <em class="notranslate" translate="no">urphantasie</em> in its own scenes of seduction, providing a release from some of the cultural and psychical repressions. This is providing <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> with a function that Freud attributes to all phantasy (daydreams, imaginings, etc.) - a filling in of the gaps that are made through the acts of restriction. Not many people get seduced in the ways shown in cinema, but the scenes presented in films provide material that is demanded from the lacunae of both cultural and individual repressions (that is, the experienced and the imagined). This does raise the issue of whether we should see <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as an <em class="notranslate" translate="no">urphantasie</em> or a secondary phantasy (the latter being more clearly part, and product, of the imaginings of daydreams and such like). However any clear-cut answer to this is unlikely and unnecessary, as all phantasy is constituted of a heterogeneous mix from the two, and teasing them apart is a seemingly impossible task. The cinematic <em class="notranslate" translate="no">urphantasie</em> is constituted of that reservoir of material we witnessed above, including the interplay of the spectator and individual films, certain cultural practices, generic formulations, and the manipulation of the corporeal to become seductive - in short, the cinematic apparatus itself. Secondary phantasy, on the other hand, is more clearly a part of the text that is actually produced in the combination of these elements. Seduction is a primal phantasy in itself, as is cinema, and the combination of these, along with the spectator’s own elements of phantasy, produces secondary phantasies. This is the case of watching scenes of seduction represented in a film, and the actual experience of watching <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> overall.</p>
        <p>The role and function of the spectator in all this can be correlated to a point that Laplanche and Pontalis make in closing their account of phantasy and sexuality. They argue, via Freud, that phantasy has a strong autoerotism, produced largely through this quality of an inmixing of realities as well as an investment of the self within the experienced phantasy. Furthermore, they postulate that this auto-erotism provides ’the connection between fantasy and desire’ and that ’fantasy is not the object of desire, but its setting’ (Laplanche and Pontalis 1986: 26). This is clearly derived from Lacan’s own position when he states: ’phantasy is the support of desire; it is not the object that is the support of desire’ (Lacan 1986: 185). Cinema, we would argue, produces a site for the spectator to engage in a type of autoerotism through this connection and setting of desire. The auto-erotism in <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is derived from the spectator’s own <em class="notranslate" translate="no">urphantasie</em> meeting that of cinema’s. Such a meeting draws the spectator into the scenes of seduction, whilst the spectator attempts to posit his/her own elements of phantasy into this. In other words, there exists in the Symbolic order of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> a structure of phantasy which provides the settings of desire, but has certain lacuna! qualities (from, for example, censorship, repression, cultural differences, and, for individual spectators, a lack of correspondence with their own phantasies). Part of the seduction of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is derived precisely from these gaps, because it is here that the spectator releases his/her own <em class="notranslate" translate="no">urphantasies</em>. This also equates to some feminist (film) theory which argues for the lack of female desire - which is both female desire seen as lack, and a lack ofa space for that desire - in phallocentric culture. The seductive qualities of a phallocular cinematic practice are directed towards men, but this does not mean that all <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has to be as such.</p>
        <p>Baudrillard offers tangents and inflections on these issues, and even if some of his ideas are unpalatable because of their curious sexual politics, there is still much to be gained by examining these points. Seduction for Baudrillard operates at the level of appearances (thus feeding into his theories on the simulacra3), and nowhere is this better illustrated than in and through the body. This is a relationship of struggle and revolution, of resistance to the gendering of the body in the Symbolic. As he puts it: ’seduction alone is radically opposed to anatomy as destiny. Seduction alone breaks the distinctive sexualization of bodies and the inevitable phallic economy that results’ (Baudrillard 1990: 10).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a4"><a href="#fn:a4">4</a></sup> One of the difficulties of Baudrillard’s argument, however, is his division of the masculine and feminine in terms of seduction and production. When he argues, for example, that the masculine is the power to produce, whilst all the feminine has is the power of seduction (a negativity of the masculine power5) there are difficulties in resolving the gender politics and implications. Baudrillard is, admittedly, giving a negative twist to the processes included in the masculine production values, and a subversive, revolutionary quality to that of feminine seduction; but the tying of the feminine to seduction is somewhat problematic given the history and ideological connotations which already exist.</p>
        <p>The part of Baudrillard’s analysis that is of greatest relevance here is when he discusses the relationship of the mirror and reflection. It is through this that we can continue to examine the idea of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as seduction, and the auto-erotism of the spectator. Baudrillard’s example of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">trompe l’oeil</em>, with its missing dimension, is comparable to the ideas being developed here. The <em class="notranslate" translate="no">trompe l’oeil</em> provides an absence within the text-image which invites the gaze of the viewer. At the same time, it is the very nature of this trick which seduces, for its enigmatic qualities pull the gaze towards it. It is these absences and enigmas which allow the interplay between seduction and phantasy, and also provide the space for seduction to operate. Baudrillard sees these gaps as actually performing like a mirror, reflecting the spectator’s own sense of self in terms of seduction - the seduction of the self’s image. For him, ’true seduction proceeds by absence’ (Baudrillard 1990: 108), for the absences are both creative points and liminal sites. In terms of the cinematic spectator, seduction operates at a number of levels, but what is fundamental is the seduction of the spectator’s gaze by the film, and the seduction of the film by the gaze. This recalls an earlier discussion on the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">passe partout</em>, the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">parergon</em>, and tain of the mirror. In these terms the tain is the seductive element of film, the glass the translucent and slight distance between spectator and desire. What seduces most is the self positioned within the frame, reflected back <em class="notranslate" translate="no">through</em> the cinematic apparatus. Seduction can only work within this frame of reference - of the self seducing the self through the images and events in the film. This brings us to the important point of the intentionality of seduction, for it is here we witness further issues of power and meaning.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Seduction of Light</h3>
        <p>When we are seduced, we are seduced towards something as well as by something/someone. There is always an intentionality involved. This suggests a number of things, including that there are two orders of seduction: one where the act of seduction is primary over the reasons for the seduction, and another where this is reversed and seduction itself is disguised by the other factors. In the first there is an acknowledgement of the seduction but not its intentionality; in the second the seduction may not even be apparent until long after it has taken place. Clearly power and knowledge determine much of this situation, but the intentionality, and directionality, of seduction underpins much of how this is played out. But one of the enfolding aspects of all this is that we are often seduced by the lack of power/knowledge, and we participate with an expectation of gaining some insight, some power and control over knowledge and the Other. The seduction of light here works at the level of power/knowledge (the seduction of light is to be able to reveal) as well as the lights of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself - the images that flicker and glow in seductive qualities.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Third Scene of Seduction – Obsession</em></h3>
        <p>Antonioni’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blow Up</em> is constructed almost entirely along what might be described as classical seduction scenarios. There are a number of different types of seduction, each operating differently, but having the same sorts of outcomes, often culminating in a type of spiritual desolation. There are sexual seductions represented initially in the fashion shoots, where the lens of Thomas’s camera is not too subtly represented as both phallus and penis. This is also shown in the sexual encounter with the two teenagers who invade Thomas’s flat and work-space. But both these seductions are really only used to contrast the real seductions which are derived more fully from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">trompe l’oeil</em>, mirrors, enigmas, and light. It is in these that we witness a representation of the intentionality of seduction, as well as the film’s capacity to seduce the spectator. (These other two scenes of seduction if anything repel the spectator from being seduced into the scene because of their masculine arrogance and phallocentric qualities.)</p>
        <p>One of these seductions is based around the relationship of Thomas, Jane, and the man in the park. At first the power and interest of the photographer are derived from a voyeurism that yields control over other people’s lives - a theme continually represented in his character. Jane’s attempt to obtain the photographs back from him results in the same sort of overt seduction we see in those other images of the fashion shoot and the teenagers. It is stated as a seduction intended to gain an entirely differentiated goal. But there is another seduction which operates beyond this, derived this time from enigma. It is the seduction based on the questions and mystery as to why the film is so important to Jane. This, in turn, leads to the primary seduction which underpins the entire film.</p>
        <p>This is the seduction oflight. This is the blowing up of the photograph so that light and dark become smudged and the question of the existence of the body is raised. Thomas’s need to know becomes the spectator’s seduction, because it also becomes our need to know. This seduction is pure seduction because it overrides all else, even allowing the spectator to become interested in a character that had so far been shown as arrogant, self-obsessed, uncaring in his feeling towards others, and sometimes brutal. As a metaphor for seduction, the photographs work well. The more we look for clues, the more we peer at the light and dark areas trying to shift them into shapes, the more the answer eludes us - so much so that the seduction has taken place before we know it, transforming itself into one of the corollaries of seduction - obsession. These are the same sorts of obsessive seductions and unanswered gazes we find in other Antonioni films - the vanishing of people in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’ Avventura</em> (1960) and the journey for a new identity, and to keep that pretence alive, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Passenger</em>. Furthermore, the blowing up of the photographs - this seductive gaze over the grainy images - reveals another quality of seduction. There are no answers to be derived from it, for seduction provides its own legitimation. The power/knowledge of seduction is not in solving the riddle of the image, but of moving the gaze outside of its usual perspective. Seduction produces more seduction, just as it produces more images within the image.</p>
        <p>The seduction of light operates in this two fold fashion. It promises answers (the seduction of power through knowledge, and knowledge through power) but only produces this blinding effect; it pulls the gaze towards something that is absolutely compulsive, but not satisfying in itself because intentionality lies elsewhere. To see how this works we can consider a few more examples.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fourth Scene of Seduction – Subjectivity</em></h3>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blade Runner</em> all the characters are driven by the need to know about their status oflife, of its duration and its relationship to the qualifications of the human and non-human. It may seem odd to describe this as seduction, forit would appear to be more about existence. But the way life itselfis established in the film makes it a seduction rather than a necessity of subjectivity. The idea of authentic Being informs a great deal of philosophy, and Sartre’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pour-soi/en-soi</em> and Heidegger’s idea of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dasein</em> provides us with an explication that can be read in the same way oflife and subjectivity as seduction. Here the seduction is not simply to live, but to have a sense of beingness, of authentic subjectivity. The replicants are more human than human; more powerful, intelligent, and, as is revealed in the final scenes of Batty’s death, more compassionate. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yet</em> still there is the seduction of subjectivity which is both more than what they have, and less. This seduction drives the narrative, and once more we can see different levels of its operation. The scene where Deckard meets Rachel is straight out of classic film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> - itis Walter meets Phyllis all over again - and operates within those parameters of seduction. The woman represents danger and sexuality because she is so unknown. This becomes problematised in a later scene with the virtual rape (or at the very least violent sexual force) of Rachel by Deckard. If this first encounter posits seduction, this later one replaces it with force. In these terms the subjectivity (of Deckard and Rachel, seemingly human and non-human) is negotiated and determined in the first scene, but undercut and questioned in the second.</p>
        <p>In the roof-top scenes which close the film we are offered the replicant’s explanation for their seduction towards the human. Ba tty’s speech which ends ’Time to die’ is a complex discourse on self-reflexivity because it reveals such a depth of knowledge on the intentionality of his actions and the processes of seduction. It is also the same sort of reversal of empathy that we see in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blow Up</em>, for the spectator now becomes located within a seduction towards this very act. Batty’s search for subjectivity comes at that very moment when life expires and an understanding takes place. The white dove which flies from his arms becomes the metaphor for the soul he and the other replicants so strongly desired. It stands for a seduction that destroys and creates at the same moment. It is as light as the blurred photographs in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Blow Up</em> are dark - but both seduce.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Seduction of the Dark</h3>
        <p>If cinema’s light seduces, then there is also that other order of seduction - the darkness that surrounds us. And if there is a seduction towards the knowledge that light promises, there is an equally seductive quality to the dark recesses of the unknown and unknowable. This is, of course, also the area of immoral seduction, of those things which seduce and then prove to be the darker side of things. And yet, both light and dark can seduce in the same way, at the same time, towards the same objective. Seduction is ultimately beyond good and evil, but what happens after seduction can often be placed within this moral climate. For this reason the seduction of the dark should not simply be seen as the evil counterpart of the seduction towards the good - for in the seductive moment they are the same thing.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fifth Scene of Seduction</em> - <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Betrayal and Revelation</em></p>
        <p>One of the ways light and dark become entwined in the structure of power/knowledge is the revelation of betrayal at the end of the seduction. The knowledge gained is a dark one, revealing the intentions of the characters, the answers to various mysteries placed throughout the events, and often a reversal in the characteristics of the protagonists. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Diaboliques</em> Christina is seduced into killing her husband, and the spectator is seduced into thinking this is an appropriate course of action - his brutality contrasted with Nicole’s (relative and seeming) tenderness allows for the idea oflegitimate murder. This is a theme of ethical cause and effect that drives a great many films. But both Christina and the spectator are duped through a much greater seduction based on betrayal, of which this expressed version is but a small part. The darkness that motivated the stated seduction overrides that sense oflegitimising the actions of escape and freedom through murder. This is an example of the intentionality of the seduction being disguised and repressed by the very act of being seduced; seduction in such scenes overcomes its intentionality.</p>
        <p>The reverse of this also operates in these scenes of betrayal, and the sense of seduction can be repressed through an overstated intentionality. In such cases the knowledge of what is taking place disguises the fact of any seduction. Michael Corleone knows he is being seduced by violence - this is its intentionality and its light; but Mike, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Last Seduction</em>, only thinks he knows he is being seduced. The seduction is, like in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Diaboliques</em>, premised on betrayal rather than escape or sex. The other inflection ohhis is where there is no sense of seduction at all, this quality only being revealed later. This can take place at the level of representation (as in the twists of film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">noir</em> and a great many thrillers) and it can also take place at the level of the cinematic apparatus. The killing of Marion a third of the way through <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Psycho</em> is a form of seduction and betrayal because the spectator, through narrative traditions, is led to believe that she is the central protagonist. We are seduced by the usual expectations of narrative cinema, and then are betrayed by her death. The revelation of this seduction comes after the shower scene when we realise that the narrative is not about her and we have been seduced into investing these attributes into that character. Certain film genres depend almost entirely on this relationship of seduction and betrayal of the spectator to construct their narrative and produce their effects. The horror genre seduces and betrays constantly in order to terrify, and the spectator is a willing participant in this whole process, acknowledging and denying the seductions from one moment to the next.</p>
        <p>Cinema’s seductive qualities are invested in all of its elements, in part because it takes the attributes of the everyday (vision, colour, sound, the body, space and time) and presents them in an excessive and intensified form. The very rarefied economies of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> become seductive because there is in them more than themselves. <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> presents seduction, and seduces, as a site of resistance, as negotiations of power and knowledge, as systems of desire; in doing so seduction becomes part of the very materiality of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself.</p>
