        <p>But that in itself was not enough. In this first formally imperfect period, our films, though novel in theme, aroused little more than curiosity.</p>
        <p>I recall a half-ironical, half-fastidious appraisal (in, I believe, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Filmkurier</em>) at the time <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Palace and Fortress</em>, one of our first exported films, was shown in Berlin:</p>
        <p>This eye-scratching imperfection of harsh lighting, plus the crudeness of the whole treatment, does have a certain appeal and even piquancy for our jaded vision. . . .</p>
        <p>And how deeply the emotions of the foreign spectator were scratched when, after <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Potemkin</em>, our films charged down on him!</p>
        <p>Born of new intellectual demands, and of the desire to live up to these demands and to be adequate to them, the formal singularities of our films astonished these audiences no less than had their themes and ideas.</p>
        <p>Often preceding official, diplomatic recognition of our country, our films successfully forced their way across frontiers, despite the obstacles of censorship, and with their art enlisted friends even among those who could not immediately realize the scope of our ideals.</p>
        <p>So it was our cinema—youngest in years, but the most vigorous, vital and rich in emotion and depth of idea—that very soon took the lead of its older sister arts on the other side of the barriers around us.</p>
        <p>And its influence abroad was immense.</p>
        <p>If in our beginnings we were more than a little indebted to American film-makers, it may also be said that this debt has been repaid with interest.</p>
        <p>When I arrived in New York in 1930 I was literally swamped with clippings referring to Milestone’s film version of <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>, which had just appeared. There was not one review that did not mention our influence on the making of this film!</p>
        <p>If Raisman had happened to arrive simultaneously with the appearance of King Vidor’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Our Daily Bread</em>, he would doubtless have seen similar references to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Soil Is Thirsty</em>.</p>
        <p>Sternberg’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Shanghai Express</em> was called to life by Ilya Trauberg’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">China Express</em>, and the obligation of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Wild Boys of the Road</em> to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Road to Life</em> is generally admitted.</p>
        <p>The German film industry considered <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unser Emden</em> a direct reply to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Potemkin</em>, while it may be said that <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Viva Villa</em> reflected the influence of all Soviet film-makers, including <em class="notranslate" translate="no">October—</em> not to mention our unfinished Mexican film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Que Viva Mexico!</em> Mamoulian’s first film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Applause</em>, was completely enslaved by “symbolism of objects,” so typical of our films of the 1920’s.</p>
        <p>This influence of the Soviet <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is many-sided—with countless indirect instances for each of the cited direct examples. It is sometimes revealed in attempts to deal with broader themes than the eternal triangle—or in a bolder portrayal of reality, a characteristic of our films’ search for fidelity—or in the mere wish to make use of those formal methods that are the fruit of our cinema’s new intellectual content.</p>
        <p>As for a theoretical comprehension of the cinema, there are still few individual efforts in this field outside our country, for only here is there any intensive or systematic attempt by film-makers themselves to work on research and analysis of this most amazing of the arts.</p>
        <p>As a genuinely major <em>art</em> the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is unique in that it is, in the full sense of the term, a child of socialism. The other arts have centuries of tradition behind them. The <em>years</em> covered by the <em>entire</em> history of cinematography are fewer than the <em>centuries</em> in which the other arts have developed.</p>
        <p>Yet what is most essential is that <em><span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as an art</em> in general, and, further, as an art not only equal to, but in many respects superior to, its fellow-arts, began to be spoken of seriously only with the beginning of Socialist cinematography.</p>
        <p>Though it was a matter of years before the full realization of our cinema, that some of the greatest minds pointed in our country to the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as the most important of the arts and the one of greatest mass-potency, it required the appearance of a brilliant constellation of Soviet films before people across the frontier began to speak of the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as an art deserving as serious attention as is ordinarily given the theater, literature, or painting.</p>
        <p>It was only then that the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> rose above the level of the music-hall, the amusement park, the zoo, and the chamber of horrors, to take its place within the family of great arts.</p>
        <p>The <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> would seem to be the highest stage of embodiment for the potentialities and aspirations of each of the arts.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is that genuine and ultimate synthesis of all artistic manifestations that fell to pieces after the peak of Greek culture, which Diderot sought vainly in opera, Wagner in music-drama, Scriabin in his color-concerti, and so on and on.</p>
        <p>For sculpture—<span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is a chain of changing plastic forms, bursting, at long last, ages of immobility.</p>
        <p>For painting—<span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is not only a solution for the problem of movement in pictorial images, but is also the achievement of a new and unprecedented form of graphic art, an art that is a free stream of changing, transforming, commingling forms, pictures, and compositions, hitherto possible only in music.</p>
        <p>Music has always possessed this possibility, but with the advent of cinema, the melodious and rhythmic flow of music acquired new potentialities of imagery—visual, palpable, concrete (true, our practice of the new art knows as yet but few cases of any complete fusion of aural and visual images).</p>
        <p>For literature—<span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is an expansion of the strict diction achieved by poetry and prose into a new realm where the desired image is directly materialized in audio-visual perceptions.</p>
        <p>And Anally, it is only in <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> that are fused into a real unity all those separate elements of the spectacle once inseparable in the dawn of culture, and which the theater for centuries has vainly striven to amalgamate anew.</p>
        <p>Here is real unity:</p>
        <p>Of mass and individual, in which the mass is genuine, and not a handful of participants in a “crowd scene,” hurrying around back-stage in order to reappear from the opposite wings to give a “bigger” impression.</p>
        <p>Here is a unity of man and space. How many inventive minds have striven unsuccessfully to solve this problem on the stage! Gordon Craig, Adolphe Appia, and how many others! And how easily this problem is solved in cinema.</p>
        <p>The screen need not adapt itself to the abstractions of Craig in order to make man and his environment commensurate. Not satisfied with the mere reality of the setting, the screen compels reality itself to participate in the action. “Our woods and hills will dance”—this is no longer merely an amusing line from a Krylov fable, but the orchestral part played by the landscape, which plays as much of a part in the film as does everything else. In a single cinematographic act, the film fuses people and a single individual, town and country. It fuses them with dizzying change and transfer. With an all-embracing compass of whole countries or of any single character. With its ability to follow watchfully not only the clouds gathering in the hills, but also the swelling of a tear from beneath an eyelash.</p>
        <p>The diapason of the dramatist’s creative potentialities widens beyond all limits. And the keyboard of the sound mixer, who long ago ceased to be a mere composer, stretches for miles to the right and to the left, embracing not only all the sounds of nature, but also any that the author may invent.</p>
        <p>We sometimes forget that we have in our hands—a genuine miracle, a miracle of technical and artistic potentialities, only a fraction of which we have as yet learned to utilize.</p>
        <p>We who have learned that there are neither limits nor insurmountable barriers to creative activity shall do well to recall this.</p>
        <p>Again and again and again will all the advantages of the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> flash out if we can picture the arts arranged according to the degree in which they are adapted to their chief task—the reflection of reality and the master of this reality—man.</p>
        <p>How narrow is the diapason of sculpture which in most cases is obliged to tear man from his inseparable environment and society in order to hint—by his features and posture—at his inner world which is a mirror of the world around him. A diapason bereft of word, color, movement, the changing phases of drama, the progressive unfolding of events.</p>
        <p>How frustrated have been those efforts by composers—Richard Strauss, in particular—to burden music with the task of conveying specific images.</p>
        <p>How bound is literature, capable of penetrating into the most subtle coils of a man’s consciousness, as well as into the movement of events and epochs, with speculative methods and melodic-rhythmic means, but can only hint at that amplitude of the senses, called for by every line and every page.</p>
        <p>How imperfect and limited, too, is the theater in this respect! Only by external <em>“physical action” and behavior</em> is it able to convey to the spectator the inner content, the inner movement of consciousness and feelings, the inner world in which live the characters and the author himself. But this is not the material of representation alone.</p>
        <p>Rejecting incidentals as well as the “imitative limitations” of the arts as defined by Lessing, and basing ourselves on the most important factors, we might describe the method of each of the arts:</p>
        <p>The method of sculpture—patterned on the human body’s structure.</p>
        <p>The method of painting—patterned on the positions of bodies and their relations with nature.</p>
        <p>The method of literature—patterned on the interrelations of reality and man.</p>
        <p>The method of theater—patterned on the behavior and activity of people roused by outer and inner motives.</p>
        <p>The method of music—patterned on the laws of the inner harmonies of emotionally apprehended phenomena.</p>
        <p>In one way or another, all of these—from the most external and lapidary, but more material and less ephemeral, to the most subtle and plastic, but less concrete and tragically ephemeral—with all the means at their disposal, strain towards a single aim.</p>
        <p>And that is, through their structures and methods—to reconstruct, to reflect reality, and above all the consciousness and feelings of man. None of the “previous” arts has been able to achieve this purpose to the full.</p>
        <p>For the ceiling of one is—the body of man.</p>
        <p>The ceiling of another—his acts and behavior.</p>
        <p>The ceiling of a third—is the elusive emotional harmony that attends these.</p>
        <p>The full embrace of the whole inner world of man, of a whole reproduction of the outer world, cannot be achieved by any one of them.</p>
        <p>When any of these arts strives to accomplish this end, by venturing outside its own frame, the very base that holds the art together is inevitably broken.</p>
        <p>The most heroic attempt to achieve this in literature was made by James Joyce in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses</em> and in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Finnegans Wake</em>.</p>
        <p>Here was reached the limit in reconstructing the reflection and refraction of reality in the consciousness and feelings of man.</p>
        <p>Joyce’s originality is expressed in his attempt to solve this task with a special dual-level method of writing: unfolding the display of events simultaneously with the particular manner in which these events pass through the consciousness and feelings, the associations and emotions of one of his chief characters. Here literature, as nowhere else, achieves an almost physiological palpability. To the whole arsenal of literary methods of influence has been added a compositional structure that I would call “ultra-lyrical.” For while the lyric, equally with the imagery, reconstructs the most intimate passage of the inner logic of feeling, Joyce patterns it on the physiological organization of the emotions, as well as on the embryology of the formation of thought.</p>
        <p>The effect at times is astounding, but the price paid is the entire dissolution of the very foundation of literary diction, the entire decomposition of literary method itself; for the lay reader the text has been turned into abracadabra.</p>
        <p>In this Joyce shared the sad fate of all the so-called “left” tendencies in art that reached full flower with the entry of capitalism into its imperialist stage.</p>
        <p>And if we examine these “leftist” arts from the viewpoint of the tendency as described, we find an extremely curious explanation of this phenomenon.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, there is a firm belief <em>in</em> the permanency of the existing order, and hence—a conviction of the limitations of man.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the arts feel a need to step beyond their limitations.</p>
        <p>This frequently produces an explosion, but an explosion directed not outwards, towards the widening of the art’s frame, which is only to be achieved by extending its content in an anti-imperialist and revolutionary direction, but inwards, towards <em>means</em>, not towards <em>content</em>. The explosion is not creative and progressive, but destructive.</p>
        <p>The arts themselves can escape the fetters of bourgeois limitations only in a revolutionary ideology and in revolutionary themes.</p>
        <p>As for their expressive means, escape here lies in a transition to a more perfected stage of all their potentialities—to cinema.</p>
        <p>For only the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> can take, as the esthetic basis of its dramaturgy, not only the statics of the human body and the dynamics of its action and behavior, but an infinitely broader diapason, reflecting the manifold movement and changing feelings and thoughts of man. This is not merely material for the depiction of man’s action and behavior on the screen, but is also the compositional framework over which is distributed a conscious and sensed reflection of the world and reality.</p>
        <p>How easily the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is able to spread out in an equal graphic of sound and sight the richness of actuality and the richness of its controlling forces, compelling the theme more and more to be born through the process of cinematographic narrative, written from a position of emotion indivisible from the feeling and thinking man.</p>
        <p>This is not a task for the theater. This is a level above the “ceiling” of its possibilities. And when it wishes to leap over the limits of these possibilities it also, no less than literature, has to pay the price of its life-like and realistic qualities. It has to retire into the immateriality of a Maeterlinck, as we have seen in his works, and whose “<em>program</em>” dreamed for the theater found this ideal as elusive as his own blue-bird!</p>
        <p>What debris of anti-realism does the theater inevitably land in the moment it sets itself “synthetic” aims! We need only point to two illustrations of this truth: the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Théâtre d’Art</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Théâtre des Arts—</em> both opening in Paris, in 1890 and 1910 respectively.</p>
        <p>The maxim of the first of these theaters, founded by the symbolist poet Paul Fort, was: <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La parole crée le décor comme le reste.<sup>1</sup></em></p>
        <p>In practice, this led to the productions such as of Pierre Quillard’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Fille aux mains coupées</em> (1891). This play,</p>
        <p>. . . in the form of a dialogue poem, was staged in this way: a narrator, standing at the side of the proscenium, read the prose passages indicating scene-changes and plot-exposition, while on the stage, veiled by a gauze curtain, the actors moved and declaimed the verses against the background of a golden panel representing primitive ikon-like figures of angels in prayer, painted by Paul Séruzier. This stylized scenery was . . . to serve as a means for “disclosing the lyricism imprisoned in the verses.”<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>The critic Pierre Véber wrote:</p>
        <p>Preference is given the lyrical word. The theater seems to vanish, to make way for dialogue declamation, itself a sort of poetic scenery.</p>
        <p>Pierre Quillard demanded that “the scenery be a purely ornamental figment, serving to supplement the illusion by analogies, in color and line, with the drama.”<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>Seeking new methods of “inductive contagion” of the spectators, Paul Fort’s theater sought to give the substance of practice to the theory of correspondences between the different senses, a popular idea among the poets and theoreticians of symbolism. . . .<sup>4</sup></p>
        <p>These new directions in the theater, by no means reprehensible in themselves, led to the most absurd and superficial excesses.</p>
        <p>[Paul Fort] presented <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Cantique des Cantiques</em> by J.-Napoléon Roinard “in eight mystical emblems and three paraphrases,” with an accompaniment of music and of perfumes “composed in a tonality corresponding to the various verses.” For the author, inspired by Rimbaud’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyelles</em>, by René Ghil’s theory of instrumentation and by the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Livre d’orchestration des Parfums</em> by Chardin Hardancourt, sought to establish a harmony of musical tone, of poem and of setting, and of the odors of perfumes.<sup>5</sup></p>
        <p>I believe that it was an imperfection of correspondence found among the other elements that led to this absurdity.</p>
        <p>The program of the latter theater (founded by the wealthy dilettante, Jacques Rouchè) contained many items of a similar nature, such as, “the designers Dethomas, Drésa, and Piot excelled in the invention of conventionalized scenery, attempting to compose ‘a symphony of colors supplementing the symphony of sounds.’”<sup>6</sup></p>
        <p>All such attempts at synthesis inevitably wreck themselves and lead only to anti-realism.</p>
        <p>Yet when these same aims are set for cinema, they not only do not lead it away from realism, but actually increase the power of its realistic affect.</p>
        <p>The unexpected “informing” narrator, for example, who is patterned after the narrator in the Kabuki theater, was perfectly and organically interwoven in the form of sub-titles into the texture of the film even in its silent period.</p>
        <p>Today the sub-title still unobtrusively narrates “prose passages indicating scene-changes and plot-exposition,” while leaving the lyrical experience of the characters to the pictorial element of the film.</p>
        <p>Even in the silent film we made attempts to move further in this direction by weaving the sub-titles into the very thick of the action, dramatizing them with montage and varying proportions within the frame. Recall the titles within the opening sequence of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Old and New</em>, which were brought directly into the emotional rhythm and the atmosphere of the film.</p>
        <p>[image]</p>
        <p>and so on.<sup>7</sup></p>
        <p>In the sound-film the sub-title, maintaining its place among the expressive means (try to remove the titles from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Minin and Pozharsky*</em> and see what is left!), and its counterpart, the actual voice of the narrator (a “convention” nearly identical with that of the theaters we have been describing), are successfully employed. The latter means is a voice whose dramatically weaving potentialities have scarcely been touched by the cinema.</p>
        <p>The late Pirandello used to dream aloud of what could be done with this voice, when we met in Berlin in 1929.</p>
        <p>How close is such a voice, intervening in the action from outside the action, to Pirandello’s whole concept! Its employment for ironical purposes was quite successfully demonstrated by René Clair in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le dernier milliardaire</em>, and even more cleverly by Kuleshov in his O. Henry film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Great Consoler</em>.</p>
        <p>In Soviet films the only dramatic and even tragic design has been given this voice by Esther Schub and the author of her commentary, Vsevold Vishnevsky, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Spain</em>, though its effect was obscured by insufficiently considered composition of the narration and by poor recording. However, the original for this and many other similar uses in the documentary film can be found in Ernest Hemingway’s text, written and spoken for Ivens’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Spanish Earth</em>.</p>
        <p>The “mystery” of the gauze stretched across the stage of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Théâtre d’Art</em> apparently lies in a desire to “unify” the diversity of the materially real environment of painted scenery, three-dimensional people, and real textures (such as gilded surfaces).</p>
        <p>This is the most difficult of problems for the theater (a solution for it has been sought in hundreds of variations, almost always leading to some degree of meaninglessness), but the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is able to solve the problem with the greatest of ease, operating as it does with photographically captured images equally as real in appearance as the objects themselves. </p>
        <p>In the mysteries of fanciful, active, and not merely naturalistically passive sound-recording, lies the similar secret potentiality of harmonizing sounds, which in their direct, life-like substance, may not be capable of combination and orchestration.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> achieves its greatest success in a field from which the theater has had to retire, defeated. This is not only in that “symphony of colors supplementing the symphony of sounds,” where the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> has enjoyed an especially happy victory.*</p>
        <p>No, this is in a victory within reach of the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> alone.</p>
        <p>This is a genuine and complete “disclosure of the lyricism imprisoned in the verses,”—that lyricism which inevitably possesses the author of a film in its particularly emotional passages.</p>
        <p>We have remarked the frustrating results of this attempt in both the “left” theater and in “left” literature.</p>
        <p>The solution of this problem has been left entirely to the cinema.</p>
        <p>Only here can real events, preserving all the richness of material and sensual fullness, be <em>simultaneously—</em></p>
        <p><em>epic</em>, in the revelation of their content,</p>
        <p><em>dramatic</em>, in the treatment of their subject, and</p>
        <p><em>lyrical</em> to that degree of perfection from which is echoed the most delicate nuance of the author’s experience of the theme-possible only in such an exquisite model of form as the system of audio-visual images of the cinema.</p>
        <p>When a film-work or any part of one achieves this triple dramatic synthesis, its impressive power is particularly great.</p>
        <p>The three sequences which I consider most successful in my own work have this character: they are epic, dramatic, and at the same time, most lyrical, if lyricism is understood as those nuances of multiple individual experience which determine the resulting forms.</p>
        <p>These sequences are the “Odessa steps” and “meeting the squadron” in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Potemkin</em>, and the “attack of the knights” in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Alexander Nevsky</em>. I have written in detail* of the first and third of these sequences, saying of the steps sequence that in its compositional progress “it behaves like a human being in a state of ecstasy,” and that the advancing gallop of the knights is “in subject—the beat of hoofs; in structure—the beat of an excited heart . . .</p>
        <p>The same may be said of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Potemkin’s</em> meeting with the fleet, where the pounding machinery was meant to embody the excited collective heart of the battleship, while the rhythm and cadences of this beating were meant to reproduce the lyrical experience of the author as he imagined himself in the position of the rebellious ship.</p>
        <p><span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> solves such problems with the utmost ease.</p>
        <p>But the point is not the ease with which it does so, nor that it can do so at all. What matters is the concreteness, materiality, and absolute compatibility of all these achievements with the demands of realism, that categorical condition for vital, worthy, and fruitful art—for Socialist art.</p>
        <p>Thus, in respect to all these features the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is a step ahead of all related fields, while remaining a contemporary of theater, painting, sculpture, and music. There was a time when, with youthful presumption, I considered that it was time for all the other arts to retire, now that an art had appeared more advanced than any of them in their own potentialities and functions. Fifteen years ago, when I was just “contemplating” film work, I called theater and <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> “the two skulls of Alexander the Great.”<sup>8</sup> Recalling the anecdote of the museum show-booth, among whose displays were the skull of Alexander at the age of twenty-five and, alongside it, his skull at the age of forty, I held that the existence of the theater alongside the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was equally absurd, for the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> was actually the grown-up age of the theater. . . .</p>
        <p>Of course, this was rather a fact from my own biography, for it was I that was growing up, out of the theater into cinema. It cannot be denied that the theater has staunchly withstood my attacks, and is still consorting peaceably with its more advanced form, which is cinema.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this advance is not quite obvious to somebody? Is there any need to pile instance on instance to prove this self-evident fact over and over again?</p>
        <p>Let us confine the case at this time to one theatrical element, to the most theatrical element in the theater—the actor. Has not the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> made demands on the actor that surpass in refinement all that he needs for survival on the stage?</p>
        <p>Look at the film work of even the best actors, especially in their first steps in this medium. Isn’t it true that what seemed the height of truth and emotional fidelity on the stage howls from the screen as the most extraordinary overacting and epileptic grimaces?</p>
        <p>How much effort had to be made by even the finest masters of the stage before they were able to rebuild a craft developed in the wide frame of the theater—in the “narrow gate” of the screen! How much more exquisite and subtle their acting becomes from scene to scene, and even from film to film! Under the very eyes of the spectator “theatricality” is transformed into genuine vitality on the screen. How astonishing and illuminating in this respect was the development of the late Boris Shchukin not only from rôle to rôle, but from film to film, playing the same role! Watch him in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lenin in October</em>, and then in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lenin in 1918!</em></p>
        <p>Self-control exerted to the millimeter of movement. A degree of fidelity of feeling that permits no refuge in theatrical conventions abolished by cinema. Super-concentration and instantaneous assumption of rôle, both incomparably more difficult in films than in the theater where the actor does not have to burn under the lights of the studio or create his role in the midst of a city street, or in the ocean surf, or in the cockpit of a supposedly looping plane—or to first play death and then two months later, to play the cold that led to it!</p>
        <p>As we can see, the indices are the same, but the demands have grown enormously, and a retrospective enrichment of previous stages of development, proceeding alongside, is obvious and undeniable.</p>
        <p>And conversely.</p>
        <p>To discriminate and, having discriminated, to develop one or another element of <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is possible only through a thorough study of the basic phenomena of cinema. And the origin of each of these elements lies in other arts.</p>
        <p>No one, without learning all the secrets of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">mise-en-scène</em> completely, can learn montage.</p>
        <p>An actor who has not mastered the entire arsenal of theater craft can never fully develop his screen potentialities.</p>
        <p>Only after mastering the whole culture of the graphic arts can a cameraman realize the compositional basis of the shot.</p>
        <p>And only on a foundation of the entire experience of dramaturgy, epos, and lyricism, can a writer create a finished work in that unprecedented literary phenomenon—film-writing, which includes in itself just such a synthesis of literary forms as the <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> as a whole comprises a synthesis of all forms of art.</p>
        <p>The inexhaustible potential of all art, having achieved its highest level of development in the form of cinema, is offered not only to masters, artists, craftsmen. Just as priceless is what this furthest development of art as a whole offers to those who meditate on the general laws of artistic creation—and to those who endeavor theoretically to grasp the phenomena of art generally as a social phenomenon with its original and inimitable methods of reflecting the world and actuality.</p>
        <p>For this purpose our <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> is an inexhaustible quarry for the definition of general laws and conditions of art as one of the most characteristic reflections of man’s spiritual activity.</p>
        <p>Having at our disposal so perfect a stage of development of all the arts, fused into one—in cinematography, we may already make infinite deductions from it as to the entire system and method of art, exhaustive for all arts, yet peculiar and individual for each of them.</p>
        <p>For here—in cinema—for the first time we have achieved <em>a genuinely synthetic art—an art of organic synthesis in its very</em> <em>essence, not a</em> “<em>concert” of co-existent, contiguous, “linked,” but actually independent arts</em>.</p>
        <p>At last we have had placed in our hands a means of learning the fundamental laws of art—laws which hitherto we could snatch at only piecemeal, here a bit from the experience of painting, there a bit from theater practice, somewhere else from musical theory. So, the <em>method of cinema, when fully comprehended, will enable us to reveal an understanding of the method of art in general</em>.</p>
        <p>We indeed have something to be proud of on this twentieth anniversary of our cinema. Within our country. And beyond its borders. Within the art of <span  class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> itself—and far beyond its borders, throughout the whole system of art.</p>
        <p>Yes, we have something to be proud of—and to work towards.</p>
