Having spent no small number of man-hours in the matter of the “enthusiasm” and “involvement” of the audience in a united and general impulse of absorption, the word “amusement” sounds opposed, alien and inimical to me. Whenever it is said that a film must “entertain,” I hear a voice: “Help yourself.”</p>
        <p>When the worthy Ivan Ivanovich Pererepenko “treats you to snuff, he always first licks the lid of his snuff-box with his tongue, and then taps it with his finger, presenting it to you, and if you are an acquaintance, says: “Shall I dare, my dear sir, to ask you to help yourself?’ And if you aren’t acquainted with him, he says: “Shall I dare, my dear sir, although I have not the honor of knowing your rank, name and patronymic, to ask you to help yourself?’” But when Ivan Nikiforovich Dovgochkhun treats you to snuff, he “puts the snuff-box straight into your hand, and says only: “Help yourself.’”<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>I’m for Ivan Nikiforovich, with his direct “help yourself.”</p>
        <p>The film’s job is to make the audience “help itself,” not to “entertain” it. To grip, not to amuse. To furnish the audience with cartridges, not to dissipate the energies that it brought into the theater. “Entertainment” is not really an entirely innocuous term: beneath it is a quite concrete, active process.</p>
        <p>But amusement and entertainment must be understood precisely as only a quantitative empowering of the inner thematic material itself, and not in any sense as a qualitative power.</p>
        <p>While we had films that “gripped,” we did not speak of entertainment. We had no time to be bored. But then this gripping was lost somewhere. The skill of constructing films that gripped was lost. And we began to talk of entertainment.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to realize this latter aim, without first mastering the former method.</p>
        <p>The slogan in favor of entertainment was regarded by many as countenancing a certain retrogressive element and, in the worst sense, as a perversion of understanding in relation to the ideological premises of our films.</p>
        <p>We must once more command a method, a directive guide to embody in stirring works of art. No one can help us in this. We must do it ourselves.</p>
        <p>It is on the subject of how to do this,—at least how to get ready to do it, that I wish to speak.</p>
        <p>To rehabilitate the ideological premise is not something to be introduced from without “at the pleasure of Repertkom,”* but must be thought of as a basic, vivifying, powerful process, fertilizing nothing less than the most thrilling element in the creative work of film direction—the director’s “treatment.” That is the task of the present essay.</p>
        <p>And there is a quite concrete occasion for this—namely, in connection with the formulation of pedagogical work in the third, or graduating, class of the directors’ course in the State <span class="notranslate" translate="no">Cinema</span> Institute where, according to the teaching program, the students must now walk out into creative mastery of directorial work.</p>
        <p>The Talmudists of method—the academic high-Marxists—may berate me, but I wish to approach this theme and this teaching simply, as life—as work. For, actually, no one as yet knows concretely how to master this, whether screening oneself behind academic citations or not.</p>
        <p>For some time, for years, I worried about those certain supernatural powers, transcending common sense and human reason, that seemed indispensable for the comprehension of the “mysteries” of creative film direction.</p>
        <p>To dissect the music of creative film direction!</p>
        <p>To dissect, but not as a corpse (in Salieri’s manner*), the music of creative film direction—that was to be our work with the graduating students of the Institute.</p>
        <p>We approach this problem simply, and not from a preconceived position of scholastic methods. And it won’t be in the corpses of worn-out film works that we’ll examine the processes of producing our own works. The anatomical theater and dissection slab are the least suitable trying grounds for the study of the theater. And the study of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> must proceed inseparably with the study of theater.</p>
        <p>To build cinematography, starting from “the idea of cinematography,” and from abstract principles, is barbarous and stupid. Only by a critical comparison with the more basic early forms of the spectacle is it possible to master critically the specific methodology of the cinema.</p>
        <p>Criticism must consist in comparing and contrasting a given fact, not with an idea, but with another fact; for this purpose it is only important that both facts, as far as possible, be carefully investigated, and that they both present, in relation to one another, different moments of development.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>We shall study this matter in the living creative process. And it will be done by us in this way, primarily.</p>
        <p>We must build simultaneously a working process and a method. And we shall proceed not in the Plekhanov manner, from preconceived positions of “method in general” to the concrete particular case, but through given concrete work on particular materials we expect to arrive at a method of cinematographic creation for the director.</p>
        <p>For this purpose we must bring out into the open the “intimate” creative process of the director in all its phases and twistings, and stand it before the audience, “in full view.”</p>
        <p>Many surprises are in store for the youth who is filled with illusions.</p>
        <p>In one connection may I, for a moment, list to the side of “entertainment”? Let us cite one of the greatest of all “entertainers”—Alexandre Dumas <em class="notranslate" translate="no">père</em>, for whom his son, Dumas <em>fils</em>, apologized: “My father is a great baby of mine—born when I was quite a little child.”<sup>4</sup></p>
        <p>Who has not been enchanted by the classic harmony in the labyrinthine structure of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Count of Monte Cristo!</em> Who has not been struck by the deadly logic that weaves and interweaves the characters and events of the novel, as if these interrelationships had existed from its very conception. Who has finally not imagined that ecstatic moment when suddenly in the brain of that “fat black” Dumas there flashed the future architecture of the novel in all its details and subtleties, with the title, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Comte de Monte Cristo</em>, blazing across the façade. And this vision has its usual echo, “Oh, how could I ever achieve that!” And how pleasantly bracing it is to recognize by tasting that cooking, how such a remarkable composition was really brought together and given body. How the fabrication of this book came with savage diligence—not in a divine flash.</p>
        <p>It is the work of a Negro, but toiling as hard as he would have under the whip of an overseer. Dumas was actually of Negro descent, and he was born in Haiti, as was Toussaint L’Ouverture, the hero of a film I want to make, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Black Consul</em>.* The nickname of Dumas’s grandfather—General Thomas Alexandre—was the “Black Devil.” </p>
        <p>And Dumas himself was called “fat black” by his envious contemporaries and rivals. A certain humbly-named Jacquot, concealed behind the loftier sound of “Eugène de Mirecourt,” published an attack entitled <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fabrique de Romans: Maison Alexandre Dumas et Cie</em>, in which he linked the origins and methods of Dumas:</p>
        <p>Scratch M. Dumas’ hide and you will find the savage. . . . He lunches on potatoes taken burning hot from the ashes of the hearth and devours them without removing the skins—a Negro! [As he needs 200,000 francs a year,] he hires intellectual deserters and translators at wages that degrade them to the condition of Negroes working under the lash of a mulatto!<sup>5</sup></p>
        <p>“Your father was black!” someone hurled in his face. “My grandfather was a monkey,” he replied. He seems to have been more sensitive to the “factory” charge.</p>
        <p>On one day only Dumas was truly grieved. Béranger, whom he really loved, wrote asking him to include an interesting exile “in the number of miners whom he employed to dig out the mineral which he transformed into sterling bullion”; and Dumas replied: “Dear old friend, My only miner is my left hand which holds the book open, while my right works twelve hours a day.”</p>
        <p>He was exaggerating. He had collaborators, “but as Napoleon had generals.”<sup>6</sup></p>
        <p>It is difficult enough to find oneself working with such frenzy. But it is even more difficult to achieve anything adequate without this frenzy.</p>
        <p>Miracles of composition—this is merely a question of persistence and the expenditure of time during the “training period” of one’s autobiography.</p>
        <p>From a viewpoint of productivity this period of romanticism is distinguished for the dizzying speed of its creative tempi: In eight days (from September 17 to September 26, 1829) Victor Hugo wrote 3,000 lines of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Hernani</em>, which stood the classic theater on its head, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marion Delorme</em> in 23 days, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Roi s’Amuse</em> in 20 days, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lucrèce Borgia</em> in 11 days, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Angelo</em> in 19 days, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Marie Tudor</em> in 19 days, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ruy Bias</em> in 34 days. This is echoed quantitatively, as well. The literary heritage of Dumas <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pere</em> numbers 1,200 volumes.</p>
        <p>The same opportunity of creating such works is equally accessible to all.</p>
        <p>Let us examine <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Count of Monte Cristo</em> in particular. Lucas-Dubreton gives us the history of its composition:</p>
        <p>In the course of a Mediterranean cruise, Dumas had passed near a little island, where he had not been able to land because “it was <em class="notranslate" translate="no">en contumace</em>.” It was the island of Monte-Cristo. The name struck him at the time. A few years later, in 1843, he arranged with an editor for the publication of a work to be called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Impressions de Voyage dam Paris</em>, but he needed a romantic plot. Then one day by good luck he read a story of twenty pages, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Diamant et la Vengeance</em>, which was laid in the period of the second Restoration and was included in Peuchet’s volume, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La Police Devoilée</em>. It caught his fancy. Here was the subject of which he had dreamed: Monte-Cristo should discover his enemies hidden in Paris!</p>
        <p>Then Maquet had the idea of telling the story of the love-affair of Monte-Cristo and the fair Mercedes and the treachery of Danglars; and the two friends started off on a new track—<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Monte-Cristo</em>, from being travel impressions in the form of a romance turned into romance pure and simple. The Abbé Faria, a lunatic born at Goa whom Chateaubriand saw vainly trying to kill a canary by hypnotizing it, helped to increase the mystery; and the Château d’If began to appear on the horizon. . . .<sup>7</sup></p>
        <p>This is how things are really put together. And to re-experience this as it takes place, and to participate in it oneself, seems to me a most useful and productive process for a student.</p>
        <p>The “method-ists” who preach otherwise and approve other “recipes” are simply wasting our precious time. But “chance” here is far less important than it might appear, and the “regularity” within the creative process is perceived and detected. There is method. But the whole villainy lies in this, that from preconceived methodological positions, nothing grows. And a tempestuous stream of creative energy, unregulated by method, yields even less.</p>
        <p>Such analysis of the building of works of art, step by step, will clarify the most severe regularity, governing each support of the super-structure, with which they arise from basic social and ideological premises.</p>
        <p>And the gold fever of money-making and self-enrichment of the Louis-Philippe epoch is no less a determining factor for the gilded legend of the fabulous wealth of the former sailor who becomes an omnipotent count, no less determining than Dumas’s childhood memories of Scheherazade and the treasures of Ali Baba. And the very fact that a sailor could become a count, meant that “anyone” might.</p>
        <p>In the general chase after gold and aristocratic titles, the sailor, Dantès who became the mythically rich Comte de Monte Cristo, served as a splendid “social ideal” for the bourgeoisie who were feverishly enriching themselves. It is not without reason that to this image is ascribed the features of an idealized self-portrait. For Dumas himself, along with the others, bathed in the turbid sea of suspicious gold accumulated through the dubious speculations of the reign of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">le roi bourgeois</em>.</p>
        <p>“A million? That’s exactly the amount I ordinarily carry for pocket money!”</p>
        <p>To an identical degree this remark was the unattainable ideal, both of the “fat black,” then the literary sovereign of the newspaper, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">feuilleton</em> and dramatic world of Paris, squandering words and money with equal recklessness, as well as of the vast hordes of greedy sharpers and rogues, overrunning the economic life of Paris.</p>
        <p>However, to sense fully how sharply these social, economical and ideological premises determine every slightest twist of form, and how inseparably they are united in their processes, one must independently and conscientiously trace a continuous and complete creative cycle from start to finish.</p>
        <p>Of course, what would be most interesting would be to catch another Goethe or Gogol, place him before an audience and set him to writing a third part of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Faust</em> or to create newly a second volume of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dead Souls</em>. But we don’t even have a live Alexandre Dumas at our disposal. So we of the Institute’s third course transform ourselves into a collective director and film-builder.</p>
        <p>The instructor is no more than <em class="notranslate" translate="no">primus inter pares</em>—the first among equals. The collective (and later each member of it individually) works its way through all the difficulties and torments of creative work, through the whole process of creative formation, from the first faint, glimmering hint of the theme, down to a decision on whether the buttons on the leather jacket of the last extra player are suitable for filming purposes.</p>
        <p>The instructor’s task is only, by a well-timed dexterous shove, to push the collective in the direction of “normal” and “fruitful” difficulties, and to push it in the direction of the collective’s correct and distinct presentation (to himself) of exactly those questions, the answers to which lead to <em>construction</em> and not to fruitless chatter “around” it.</p>
        <p>That is how they teach you to fly in the circus. The trapeze is mercilessly held back, or the pupil finds a fist instead of a helping hand if his timing is false. No great harm if he falls once or twice outside the safety net onto the chairs around the arena. Next time—he won’t make that mistake.</p>
        <p>But no less carefully, at each stage of the unfolding creative process, must the indicated secondary material and the experience of the “inherited past,” at the proper place, be thrust into the hands of the entangled or stuck “warriors.” This is not enough, if at hand is not that exhausting synthetic giant of <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> who, at every turn, is more than the “inherited past” and the “living heir,” forming in its own field a solid technique.</p>
        <p>Within three years a systematic course in special subjects has replaced at the Institute a thin coating of sporadic lectures by all sorts of “prominent” film-workers. These people ran into the Institute as they would into a street-car, strange and unrelated to each other, just like street-car passengers, rushing to the exit as fast as possible, after blurting 45 minutes’ worth of something unconnected and episodic. Then they were whirled out of the sight of their dazed proselytes, along the orbit of their private activities.</p>
        <p>This “little episode” also had to be re-built in a fundamental way. Within the plan of the general course, specialists are invited in at the proper time, to deal with definite, concrete cases, at a definite stage of the general movement of the unfolding creative process. To deal with that particular question in which he is expert.</p>
        <p>All this aims at a properly large project in which the collective or, later, the individual, is responsible to the very end. In getting rid of the “little episodes” in the instructional plan, we have also done away with the pitiable “little episodes” prepared by graduating students. These short “études” of the graduates, miscellaneous and miserable, but self-satisfying, even shorter in intelligence than they are in footage, must be dropped as being wholly inexpedient. After working on a graduate project on the scale, say, of a cathedral, the graduate architect usually finds himself building something accessible to everyone—a privy. But, after designing for graduation one tiny <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pisoir</em>, it is risky to turn to, yes, to what you please! And yet, year after year, we have seen this happen to graduates from the Institute. This has to be fundamentally scrapped.</p>
        <p>It is true that in practice a film is broken up into separate episodes. But these episodes all hang from the rod of a single ideological, compositional and stylistic whole.</p>
        <p>The art of cinematography is not in selecting a fanciful framing, or in taking something from a surprising cameraangle.</p>
        <p>The art is in every fragment of a film being an organic part of an organically conceived whole.</p>
        <p>With such organically thought-out and photographed parts of one large significant and general conception, these must be segments of some whole, and by no means with stray, strolling études.</p>
        <p>On these filmed segments, on the unfilmed but prepared episodes that are planned to precede or follow these, on the development of montage plans and lists according to the place of these parts in the whole—on such a base creative irresponsibility will be really liquidated among the students.</p>
        <p>From beginning to end their work will be examined, simultaneously with responsible demonstrations as to how far they are capable of realizing in practice the firmly planned general concept; although at this stage it is not yet the student’s own individual concept, but the collectively worked out concept, but this already teaches the hard lesson of self-discipline. Self-discipline that will be even more needed at the moment when the concept will be individual and his own.</p>
        <p>But before reaching this last stage, this last frontier, already bordering on production away from the school, the students run a long gantlet of living and dead “experts.”</p>
        <p>At a certain stage this will take the form of a long discussion of the type, image, and character of the characters in his project. The ashes of Balzac, Gogol, Dostoyevsky, and Ben Jonson will be stirred in such discussions. The question will arise as to the personification of such a type, image, or character. Here we’ll depend on Kachalov’s confession of his work on the role of the “Baron” in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Lower Depths</em>, Batalov will talk with us, or Max Shtraukh will tell us of the mechanics of creating Rubinchik in Zarkhi’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Joy Street</em>.</p>
        <p>Moving through the forests of story-construction, we’ll pull apart with Aksënov the skeletons of the Elizabethans, we’ll listen to Dumas <em class="notranslate" translate="no">pere</em> and Victor Shklovsky on the outlining of story structures, and on the methods of Weltmann’s works. And then, having talked over dramatic situations with the late John Webster, Nathan Zarkhi and Volkenstein, we shall interest ourselves in how these situations are clothed in words.</p>
        <p>Alexei Maximovich Gorky will probably not refuse to initiate us in the methods of writing the dialogue for <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Lower Depths</em> or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yegor Bulichev and Others</em>. Nikolai Erdmann will tell us how it is done in his plays. And Isaac Babel will speak of the specific texture of image and word and of the technique of the extreme laconism of literature’s expressive means—Babel who, perhaps, knows in practice better than anyone else, that great secret, that “there is no iron that can enter the human heart with such stupefying effect as a period, placed at the right moment.”<sup>8</sup> And he may speak of how, with this laconism, was created so inimitably his wonderful (and far from being sufficiently appreciated) play <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sunset</em>. This is perhaps the best example of fine dramatic dialogue in recent years.</p>
        <p>All this will arise at the corresponding stages of the single progressing creative process of our collective director on his film.</p>
        <p>The fusing of the separate stages along independent analytical excursions is not so very strange. Construction of theme and story can sometimes be completely independent of the development in words. Aren’t both <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Revizor</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dead Souls</em> brilliant examples of the development of stories “set” Gogol from outside?*</p>
        <p>The question of a musical accompaniment for the sound medium. The question of material means. Analysis of a number of examples of our “heritage” in other areas as well, and each from the angle of that special need where it, and peculiarly it, can be doubly useful.</p>
        <p>James Joyce and Emile Zola.</p>
        <p>Honoré Daumier and Edgar Degas.</p>
        <p>Toulouse-Lautrec or Stendhal.</p>
        <p>And lengthily and circumstantially will be analyzed by Marxist and Leninist specialists the question of the correct ideological formulation of the problem from the standpoint of approach to the theme and to a social understanding of this thing. In this way we expect to secure those, mobilized with experience and qualified by sustained guidance, who will be capable of creating films.</p>
        <p>And the most serious and interesting part of this work—the central part of the director’s creative work—is to train students in “treatment” and to work up with them the process of how this proceeds and is carried out.</p>
        <p>We work essentially on such a low-experimental triviality of simplified perceived tasks, that we simply do not have occasion to observe works that are original, living, creative, that have an inter-related social treatment and conception, with developed form.</p>
        <p>Our works are on such a level of simplification that one recalls the famous cartoon of the automatic sausage factory: from one side enter boxes with handles containing pigs, at the other side the same boxes come out, now containing sausages.</p>
        <p>Between the schematic scraped skeleton of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">slogan</em> and the empty skin of outer <em>form</em> there are no layers of tangible, living flesh and muscle.</p>
        <p>There are no organs, acting in relation to each other. And then people are surprised that the skin hangs so formlessly. And through its pitifully thin simplification juts the sharp bones of a mechanical perception of “social” thematics. Not enough flesh and muscle.</p>
        <p>That is why Gorky’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Yegor Bulichev and Others</em> was greeted with such unanimous joy. Even though the work has not answered a basic problem of ours: the men and women shown in it are not yet ours, and of today. We’ll continue to wait for these from the mind of Alexei Maximovich.*<sup>9</sup></p>
        <p>On the other hand, here is flesh. Here is muscle. And this flesh was made today, when all around us on stage and screen are not even the “men in boxes” that Chekhov wrote about, but simply boxes without men. Whereas, tightly packed as they are with vulgar citations, our works resemble the barbed wire of harsh truth, covered with muslin—and we are astonished that blood doesn’t circulate through these barbs, and that the muslin doesn’t beat an excited pulse.</p>
        <p>From the sublime to the ridiculous is one step. From a sublimely premised idea, formulated in a slogan, to a living work of art—is several hundred steps. If we take but one step, we achieve only the ridiculous result of the accommodating trash of the present.</p>
        <p>We must begin to learn how to do three-dimensional, rounded works, going from the two-dimensional flat patterns with a “direct wire” from the slogan to the story—without a transfer.</p>
        <p>How an ideological concept works, making a serious approach towards a film, we can trace in my own work, although in somewhat unusual social circumstances. This was in Hollywood. In the world of Paramount Pictures, Inc. And the mat ter concerned the treatment and script of a work of exceptionally high quality.</p>
        <p>Even though not beyond ideological defects, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">An American Tragedy</em> by Theodore Dreiser is a work that has every chance of being numbered among the classics of its period and place. That this material contained the collision of two irreconcilable viewpoints—the “front office’s” and ours—became clear from the moment of submitting the first rough draft of a script.</p>
        <p>“Is Clyde Griffiths guilty or not guilty—in your treatment?” was the first question from the head of Paramount, B. P. Schulberg.</p>
        <p>“Not guilty,” was our answer.</p>
        <p>“But then your script is a monstrous challenge to American society . . .</p>
        <p>We explained that we consider the crime committed by Griffiths the sum total of those social relations, the influence of which he was subjected to at every stage of his unfolding biography and character, during the course of the film. For us this was, essentially, the whole interest of the work.</p>
        <p>“We would prefer a simple, tight whodunit about a murder . . .”</p>
        <p>. . .and about the love of a boy and girl,” someone added, with a sigh.</p>
        <p>The possibility of two such basically opposed treatments of the work’s protagonist should not astonish you.</p>
        <p>Dreiser’s novel is as broad and shoreless as the Hudson; it is as immense as life itself, and allows almost any point of view on itself. Like every “neutral” fact of nature itself, his novel is ninety-nine per cent statement of facts and one per cent attitude towards them. This epic of cosmic veracity and objectivity had to be assembled in a tragedy—and this was unthinkable without a world-attitude of direction and point.</p>
        <p>The studio heads were disturbed by the question of guilt or innocence from another point of view: guilty would mean-unattractive. How could we allow a hero to seem unattractive? What would the box-office say?</p>
        <p>But if he weren’t guilty . . .</p>
        <p>Because of the difficulties around “this damned question” <em class="notranslate" translate="no">An American Tragedy</em> lay inactive for five years after its purchase by Paramount. It was approached—but no more than approached—even by the patriarch of films, David Wark Griffith, and Lubitsch, and many others.</p>
        <p>With their customary cautious prudence the “heads,” in our case too, dodged a decision. They suggested that we complete the script “as you feel it,” and then, “we’ll see. . . .”</p>
        <p>From what I have already said, it must be perfectly evident that in our case, as distinct from previous handlings, the matter of a difference of opinion was not based on a decision as to some particular situation, but was far deeper, touching the question of the social treatment—wholly and fundamentally.</p>
        <p>It is now interesting to trace how in this way a taken aim begins to determine the modeling of the separate parts and how this particular aim, with its demands, impregnates all problems of determining situations, of psychological deepening, and of the “purely formal” aspect of the construction as a whole—and how it pushes one toward completely new, “purely formal” methods which, when generalized, can be assembled into a new theoretical realization of the guiding discipline of cinematography as such.</p>
        <p>It would be difficult to set forth here the entire situation of the novel: one can’t do in five lines what Dreiser required two bulky volumes to do. We shall touch upon only the outer central point of the outer story side of the tragedy—the murder itself, though the tragedy, of course, is not in this, but in that tragic course pursued by Clyde, whom the social structure drives to murder. And fundamental attention is drawn to this in our script.</p>
        <p>Clyde Griffiths, having seduced a young factory girl employed in a department managed by him, cannot help her obtain an illegal abortion. He sees himself forced to marry her. Yet this would ruin all his visions of a career, as it would upset his marriage with a wealthy girl who is in love with him.</p>
        <p>Clyde’s dilemma: he must either relinquish forever a career and social success, or—get rid of the girl.</p>
        <p>Clyde’s adventures in his collisions with American realities have by this time already molded his psychology, so that after a long internal struggle (not with moral principles, but with his own neurasthenic lack of character), he decides on the latter course.</p>
        <p>He elaborately thinks out and prepares her murder—a boat is to be upset, apparently accidentally. All the details are thought out with the over-elaboration of the inexperienced criminal, which subsequently entangles the dilettante in a fatal mesh of incontrovertible evidence.</p>
        <p>He sets out with the girl in a boat. In the boat the conflict between pity and aversion for the girl, between his characterless vacillation and his greedy snatching at a brilliant material future, reaches a climax. Half-consciously, half-unconsciously, in a wild inner panic, the boat is overturned. The girl drowns.</p>
        <p>Abandoning her, Clyde saves himself as he had planned beforehand, and falls into the very net that he had woven for his extrication.</p>
        <p>The boat episode is effected in the way that similar incidents take place: it is neither fully defined nor completely perceived—it is an undifferentiated tangle. Dreiser presents the matter so impartially that the further development of events is left formally, not to the logical course of the story, but to the processes of law.</p>
        <p>It was imperative for us to sharpen the <em>actual</em> and <em>formal</em> innocence of Clyde within the very act of perpetrating the crime.</p>
        <p>Only thus could we make sufficiently precise the “monstrous challenge” to a society whose mechanism brings a rather characterless youth to such a predicament and then, invoking morality and justice, seats him in the electric chair.</p>
        <p>The sanctity of the <em>formal</em> principle in the codes of honor, morality, justice, and religion—is primary and fundamental in America. On this is based the endless game of advocacy in the courts, and the elaborate games among lawyers and parliamentarians. The essence of what is being formally argued is an altogether subsidiary matter.</p>
        <p>Therefore the conviction of Clyde, though essentially deserved by his role in this affair (which concerns no one), in spite of proof of his <em>formal</em> innocence, would be regarded in America as something “monstrous”: a judicial murder.</p>
        <p>It was therefore imperative to develop the boat scene with indisputable precision as to Clyde’s <em>formal</em> innocence. Yet without whitewashing Clyde in any way, nor removing any particle of blame.</p>
        <p>We chose this treatment: Clyde wants to commit the murder, but he <em>cannot</em>. At the moment that requires decisive action, he falters. Simply from weakness of will.</p>
        <p>However, before this inner “defeat,” he excites in the girl Roberta such a feeling of alarm that, when he leans toward her, already defeated inwardly and ready “to take everything back,” she recoils from him in horror. The boat, off-balance, rocks. When, in trying to support her, he accidentally knocks his camera against her face, she finally loses her head and in her terror stumbles, falls, and the boat overturns.</p>
        <p>For greater emphasis we show her rising to the surface again. We even show Clyde trying to swim to her. But the machinery of crime has been set in motion and continues to its end, even against Clyde’s will: Roberta cries out weakly, tries to retreat from him in her horror, and, not being able to swim, drowns.</p>
        <p>Being a good swimmer Clyde reaches the shore and, coming to his senses, continues to act in accordance with the fatal plan he had prepared for the crime—from which he had deviated only for a moment in the boat.</p>
        <p>The psychological and tragic deepening of the situation in this form is indubitable. Tragedy is heightened to an almost Grecian level of “blind Moira—fate” that, once conjured into existence, will not relax her hold on the one who summoned her. Heightened to a tragic, racking “causality” that, once it claims its rights, drives on to a logical conclusion whatever has been brought to life through the pitiless course of its processes.</p>
        <p>In this crushing of a human being by a “blind” cosmic principle, by the inertia of the progress of laws over which he has no control, we have one of the basic premises of antique tragedy. It mirrors the passive dependence of the man of that day on the forces of nature. It is analogous to what Engels, in connection with another period, wrote of Calvin:</p>
        <p>His predestination doctrine was the religious expression of the fact that in the commercial world of competition success or failure does not depend upon a man’s activity or cleverness, but upon circumstances uncontrollable by him. It is not of him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of the mercy of unknown superior economic powers. . . .<sup>10</sup></p>
        <p>An ascent to the atavism of primitive cosmic conceptions, seen through an accidental situation of our day, is always a means of racking a dramatic scene to the heights of tragedy. But our treatment was not limited by this. It was pregnant with meaningful sharpnesses along the whole further course of the action.</p>
        <p>In Dreiser’s book, “for the sake of preserving the honor of the family,” Clyde’s rich uncle supplies him with the “apparatus” of defense.</p>
        <p>The defense lawyers have no essential doubt that a crime was committed. None the less, they invent a “change of heart” experienced by Clyde under the influence of his love and pity for Roberta. Simply invented on the spur of the moment, this is pretty good.</p>
        <p>But this is made far more evil when there <em>really</em> was such a change. When this change comes from quite different motives. When there really was no crime. When the lawyers are convinced that there was a crime. And with a downright lie, so near the truth and at the same time so far from it, they endeavor in this slanderous way to whitewash and save the accused.</p>
        <p>And it becomes still more dramatically evil when, in the adjacent moment, the “ideology” of your treatment disturbs the proportions and, in another place, the epic indifference of Dreiser’s narrative.</p>
        <p>Almost the whole of the second volume is filled with the trial of Clyde for the murder of Roberta and with the hunting down of Clyde to a conviction, to the electric chair.</p>
        <p>As part of the background of the trial it is indicated that the true aim of the trial and prosecution of Clyde, however, has no relation to him whatsoever. This aim is solely to create the necessary popularity among the farming population of the state (Roberta was a farmer’s daughter) for the prosecuting District Attorney Mason, so that he may win the necessary support for his nomination as judge.</p>
        <p>The defense take on a case which they know to be hopeless (“at best ten years in the penitentiary”) on the same plane of political struggle. Belonging to the opposite political camp, their primary aim is to exert their utmost strength in defeating the ambitious prosecutor. For one side, as for the other, Clyde is merely a means to an end.</p>
        <p>Already a toy in the hands of “blind” Moira, fate, “causality” <em class="notranslate" translate="no">á la greque</em>, Clyde also becomes a toy in the hands of the far from blind machinery of bourgeois justice, machinery employed as an instrument of political intrigue.</p>
        <p>Thus is tragically expanded and generalized the fortunes of the particular case of Clyde Griffiths into a genuinely “American tragedy in general”—a characteristic story of a young American at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
        <p>The whole tangle of design within the trial itself was almost entirely eliminated in the script’s construction, and was replaced by the pre-election bidding, visible through the manipulated solemnity of the courtroom, being used as nothing more than a drill-ground for a political campaign.</p>
        <p>This fundamental treatment of the murder determines the tragic deepening and the strengthened ideological sharpness of yet another part of the film and another figure: the mother.</p>
        <p>Clyde’s mother runs a mission. Her religion is a purblind fanaticism. She is so convinced of her absurd dogma that her figure inspires one’s involuntary respect and grows almost monumental; one detects the glow of a martyr’s aureole.</p>
        <p>Even in spite of the fact that she is the first embodiment of the guilt of American society in relation to Clyde: her teachings and principles, her aim towards Heaven rather than training her son for work were the initial premises for the ensuing tragedy.</p>
        <p>Dreiser shows her fighting to the last for her son’s innocence, working as a trial-reporter for a newspaper in order to be near her son, touring America (like the mothers and sisters of the Scottsboro boys) with lectures, to collect enough money to appeal the verdict in Clyde’s case. She definitely acquires the self-sacrificial grandeur of a heroine. In Dreiser’s work this grandeur radiates sympathy for her moral and religious doctrines.</p>
        <p>In our treatment Clyde, in his death-cell, confesses to his mother (rather than to the Reverend McMillan, as in the novel) that, though he did not kill Roberta, he had planned to do so.</p>
        <p>His mother, for whom the word is the deed, and the thought of sin equivalent to its execution, is stunned by his confession. In a way exactly opposite to the grandeur of the mother in Gorky’s novel, this mother also becomes her son’s betrayer. When she goes to the Governor with a petition for her son’s life, she is startled by his direct question: “Do you yourself believe in your son’s innocence?” At this moment that is to decide the fate of her son—she is silent.</p>
        <p>The Christian sophism of an ideal unity (of deed and thought) and a material unity (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">de facto</em>), a parody of dialectics, leads to the final tragic denouement.</p>
        <p>The petition is disregarded, and the dogma and dogmatism of its bearer are alike discredited. The mother’s fatal moment of silence cannot even be washed away by her tears when she takes leave forever of the son whom she has, with her own hands, delivered into the jaws of the Christian Baal. The more poignant these last scenes become in sadness, the more bitterly do they lash at the ideology that brought this sadness.</p>
        <p>In my opinion our treatment succeeded in ripping some of the masks—though not all—from the monumental figure of the mother.</p>
        <p>And Dreiser was the first to salute all that had been brought to his work by our treatment.</p>
        <p>In our treatment the tragedy within the framework of the novel was consummated far earlier than in these final scenes. This end—the cell—the electric chair—the brightly polished spittoon (which I saw myself at Sing-Sing) at his feet—all this is no more than an end to one particular embodiment of that tragedy which continues to be enacted every hour and every minute in the United States, far outside the covers of novels.</p>
        <p>The choice of such a “dry” and “hackneyed” formula of social treatment affords more than a sharpening of situations and a deepening revelation of images and characters.</p>
        <p>Such a treatment profoundly acts also upon purely formal methods. It was thanks particularly to this and out of this that was conclusively formulated the concept of the “inner monologue” in cinema, an idea that I had carried in my mind for six years previously. Before the advent of sound made possible its practical realization.</p>
        <p>As we have seen, one needed an extraordinarily differentiated sharpness of exposition of what was taking place within Clyde before that moment of the boat’s “accident,” and we realized that to develop an outer presentation of this would not solve our problem.</p>
        <p>The whole arsenal of knitted brows, rolling eyes, hard breathing, contorted postures, stony faces, or close-ups of convulsively working hands, was inadequate for the expression of those subtleties of the inner struggle in all its nuances.</p>
        <p>The camera had to penetrate “inside” Clyde. Aurally and visually must be set down the feverish <em>race of thoughts</em>, intermittently with the outer actuality—the boat, the girl sitting opposite him, his own actions. The form of the “inner monologue” was born.</p>
        <p>These montage sketches were wonderful.</p>
        <p>Even literature is almost powerless in this domain. It is limited either to the primitive rhetoric used by Dreiser to describe Clyde’s inner murmurings* or to the worse pseudoclassic tirades of O’Neill’s heroes in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Strange Interlude</em> who tell the audience, in “asides,” what they are thinking, to supplement what they say to each other. In this the theater limps more than does orthodox literary prose.<sup>11</sup></p>
        <p>Only the film-element commands a means for an adequate presentation of the whole course of thought through a disturbed mind.</p>
        <p>Or, if literature can do it, it is only a literature that breaks through the limits of its orthodox enclosure. Literature’s most brilliant achievement in this field has been the immortal “inner monologues” of Leopold Bloom in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Ulysses</em>. When Joyce and I met in Paris, he was intensely interested in my plans for the inner film-monologue, with a far broader scope than is afforded by literature.</p>
        <p>Despite his almost total blindness, Joyce wished to see those parts of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Potemkin</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">October</em> that, with the expressive means of film culture, move along kindred lines.</p>
        <p>The “inner monologue,” as a literary method of abolishing the distinction between subject and object in stating the hero’s re-experience in a crystallized form, is first observed by research-workers in literary experiment as early as 1887, in the work of Edouard Dujardin, pioneer on the “stream of consciousness,” <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les lauriers sont coupés.</em><sup>12</sup></p>
        <p>As theme, as world-perception, as “sensation,” as description of an object, but not as method, one can find it, of course, even earlier. “Slipping” from the objective into the subjective, and back again, is a characteristic of the writings of the romantics—E. T. A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Gerard de Nerval<sup>13</sup> But as a method of literary style, rather than as an inter-lacing in the story, or a form of literary description, we first find it used by Dujardin, as a specific method of exposition, as a specific method of construction; its absolute literary perfection is achieved by Joyce and Larbaud, thirty-one years later.</p>
        <p>It finds full expression, however, only in the cinema.</p>
        <p>For only the sound-film is capable of reconstructing all phases and all specifics of the course of thought.</p>
        <p>What wonderful sketches those montage lists were!</p>
        <p>Like thought, they would sometimes proceed with visual images. With sound. Synchronized or non-synchronized. Then as sounds. Formless. Or with sound-images: with objectively representational sounds . . .</p>
        <p>Then suddenly, definite intellectually formulated words—as “intellectual” and dispassionate as pronounced words. With a black screen, a rushing imageless visuality.</p>
        <p>Then in passionate disconnected speech. Nothing but nouns. Or nothing but verbs. Then interjections. With zigzags of aimless shapes, whirling along with these in synchronization.</p>
        <p>Then racing visual images over complete silence.</p>
        <p>Then linked with polyphonic sounds. Then polyphonic images. Then both at once.</p>
        <p>Then interpolated into the outer course of action, then interpolating elements of the outer action into the inner monologue.</p>
        <p>As if presenting inside the characters the inner play, the conflict of doubts, the explosions of passion, the voice of reason, rapidly or in slow-motion, marking the differing rhythms of one and the other and, at the same time, contrasting with the almost complete absence of outer action: a feverish inner debate behind the stony mask of the face.</p>
        <p>How fascinating it is to listen to one’s own train of thought, particularly in an excited state, in order to catch yourself, looking at and listening to your mind. How you talk “to yourself,” as distinct from “out of yourself.” The syntax of inner speech as distinct from outer speech. The quivering inner words that correspond with the visual images. Contrasts with outer circumstances. How they work reciprocally. . . .</p>
        <p>To listen and to study, in order to understand structural laws and assemble them into an inner monologue construction of the utmost tension of the struggle of tragic re-experience. How fascinating!</p>
        <p>And what scope for creative invention and observation. And how obvious it becomes that the material of the sound-film is not dialogue.</p>
        <p><em>The true material of the sound-film is, of course, the monologue</em>.</p>
        <p>And how unexpectedly, in its practical embodiment of an unforeseen, particular, concrete case to be expressed, it calls across to the theoretically long foreseen “last word” </p>
        <p>on montage form in general. That the montage form, as structure, is a reconstruction of the laws of the thought process.</p>
        <p>Here the particularity of treatment, fertilized by a new and not a former formal method, leaves its limits and generalizes in new theoretical scope and in principle the theory of montage form as a whole.</p>
        <p>(However, this does not by any means imply that the <em>thought</em> process as a <em>montage form</em> must necessarily have the process of thought as its <em>subject!</em>)</p>
        <p>The notes for this 180° advance in sound film culture—languished in a suitcase at the hotel and were eventually buried Pompeii-like, beneath a mass of books, and while they waited for realization . . .</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">An American Tragedy</em> was given to Josef von Sternberg to film, and he directly, literally, discarded everything on which our treatment had been based, and restored everything that we had discarded.</p>
        <p>As for an “inner monologue,” it didn’t occur to him. . . .</p>
        <p>Sternberg confined his attention to the studio’s wishes—and filmed a straight detective case.</p>
        <p>The old gray lion Dreiser battled for our “distortion” of his work, and brought Paramount, who had filmed a formally and outwardly correct version of his story, into court.</p>
        <p>Two years later O’Neill’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Strange Interlude</em> was “adapted” for the screen, and we were given double and triple explanatory voices around the silent face of the hero, giving additional tonnage to the playwright’s cuneiform dramaturgy. A bloody mockery of what might be achieved with correct montage principles—in the inner monologue!</p>
        <p>Work of a similar type. Solution by treatment of the work in hand. Estimation by treatment. But of greatest significance, a constructively artistic and formally fruitful rôle for this “boring,” “obligatory,” “imposed” ideology and ideological restraint.</p>
        <p>Not a schematic realization but a living organism of production—this is the fundamental work facing the direction collective of the Third Course at the State <span class="notranslate" translate="no">cinema</span> Institute. And with all methods we shall seek the themes for this work in the many-sided thematic ocean all around us.</p>
