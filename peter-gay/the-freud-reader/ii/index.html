            <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Unconscious</h2>
            <p>It is significant that among Freud’s five published papers on metapsychology, that on the unconscious is by far the longest. If the series of “<span>Papers on Metapsychology</span>”, Freud’s English editors write, “<span>may perhaps be regarded as the most important of all Freud’s theoretical writings, there can be no doubt that the present essay on ‘The Unconscious’ is the culmination of that series</span>” (SE XIV, 161). Of all the “<span>shibboleths</span>” of psychoanalysis, this is doubtless the one truly indispensable one: it explains how Freud can confidently assert that the mind, which appears so chaotic, contradictory, beyond causation, is ruled by inexorable laws. Mental events are like pearls on an invisible chain, a chain largely invisible precisely because many of the links are unconscious. The evidence for the unconscious, Freud had been arguing since the 1890s, is too powerful to be ignored, and it was one of his grievances against the philosophers that they, he claimed, equated mind with consciousness. He published this long paper in two successive issues of the <em>Zeitschrift</em> toward the end of 1915.</p>
            <p>We have learnt from psycho—analysis that the essence of the process of repression lies, not in putting an end to, in annihilating, the idea which represents an instinct, but in preventing it from becoming conscious. When this happens we say of the idea that it is in a state of being ‘unconscious’, and we can produce good evidence to show that even when it is unconscious it can produce effects, even including some which finally reach consciousness. Everything that is repressed must remain unconscious; but let us state at the very outset that the repressed does not cover everything that is unconscious. The unconscious has the wider compass: the repressed is a part of the unconscious.</p>
            <p>How are we to arrive at a knowledge of the unconscious? It is of course only as something conscious that we know it, after it has undergone transformation or translati.on into something conscious. Psycho-analytic work shows us every day that translation of this kind is possible. In order that this should come about, the person under analysis must overcome certain resistances—the same resistances as those which, earlier, made the material concerned into something repressed by rejecting it from the conscious.</p>
            <p>I. <em>Justification for the Concept of the Unconscious</em></p>
            <p>Our right to assume the existence of something mental that is unconscious and to employ that assumption for the purposes of scientific work is disputed in many quarters. To this we can reply that our assumption of the unconscious is <em>necessary</em> and <em>legitimate</em>, and that we possess numerous proofs of its existence.</p>
            <p>It is <em>necessary</em> because the data of consciousness have a very large number of gaps in them; both in healthy and in sick people psychical acts often occur which can be explained only by presupposing other acts, of which, nevertheless, consciousness affords no evidence. These not only include parapraxes and dreams in healthy people, and everything described as a psychical symptom or an obsession in the sick; our most personal daily experience acquaints us with ideas that come into our head we do not know from where, and with intellectual conclusions arrived at we do not know how. All these conscious acts remain disconnected and unintelligible if we insist upon claiming that every mental act that occurs in us must also necessarily be experienced by us through consciousness; on the other hand, they fall into a demonstrable connection if we interpolate between them the unconscious acts which we have inferred. A gain in meaning is a perfectly justifiable ground for going beyond the limits of direct experience. When, in addition, it turns out that the assumption of there being an unconscious enables us to construct a successful procedure by which we can exert an effective influence upon the course of conscious processes, this success will have given us an incontrovertible proof of the existence of what we have assumed. This being so, we must adopt the position that to require that whatever goes on in the mind must also be known to consciousness is to make an untenable claim.</p>
            <p>We can go further and argue, in support of there being an unconscious psychical state, that at any given moment consciousness includes only a small content, so that the greater part of what we call conscious knowledge must in any case be for very considerable periods of time in a state of latency, that is to say, of being psychically unconscious. When all our latent memories are taken into consideration it becomes totally incomprehensible how the existence of the unconscious can be denied. But here we encounter the objection that these latent recollections can no longer be described as psychical, but that they correspond to residues of somatic processes from which what is psychical can once more arise. The obvious answer to this is that a latent memory is, on the contrary, an unquestionable residuum of a <em>psychical</em> process. But it is more important to realize clearly that this objection is based on the equationnot, it is true, explicitly stated but taken as axiomatic-of what is conscious with what is mental. This equation is either a <em>petitio</em> principii which begs the question whether everything that is psychical is also necessarily conscious; or else it is a matter of convention, of nomenclature. In this latter case it is, of course, like any other convention, not open to refutation. The question remains, however, whether the convention is so expedient that we are bound to adopt it. To this we may reply that the conventional equation of the psychical with the conscious is totally inexpedient. It disrupts psychical continuities, plunges us into the insoluble difficulties of psycho-physical parallelism, is open to the reproach that for no obvious reason it over-estimates the part played by consciousness, and that it forces us prematurely to abandon the field of psychological research without being able to offer us any compensation from other fields.</p>
            <p>It is clear in any case that this question—whether the latent states of mental life, whose existence is undeniable, are to be conceived of as conscious mental states or as physical ones—threatens to resolve itself into a verbal dispute. We shall therefore be better advised to focus our attention on what we know with certainty of the nature of these debatable states. As far as their physical characteristics are concerned, they are totally inaccessible to us: no physiological concept or chemical process can give us any notion of their nature. On the other hand, we know for certain that they have abundant points of contact with conscious mental processes; with the help of a certain amount of work they can be transformed into, or replaced by, conscious mental processes, and all the categories which we employ to describe conscious mental acts, such as ideas, purposes, resolutions and so on, can be applied to them. Indeed, we are obliged to say of some of these latent states that the only respect in which they differ from conscious ones is precisely in the absence of consciousness. Thus we shall not hesitate to treat them as objects of psychological research, and to deal with them in the most intimate connection with conscious mental acts.</p>
            <p>The stubborn denial of a psychical character to latent mental acts is accounted for by the circumstance that most of the phenomena concerned have not been the subject of study outside psycho-analysis. Anyone who is ignorant of pathological facts, who regards the parapraxes of normal people as accidental, and who is content with the old saw that dreams are froth <em>[‘Triiume sind Schiiume’]</em> has only to ignore a few more problems of the psychology of consciousness in order to spare himself any need to assume an unconscious mental activity. Incidentally, even before the time of psycho-analysis, hypnotic experiments, and especially post-hypnotic suggestion, had tangibly demonstrated the existence and mode of operation of the mental unconscious.</p>
            <p>The assumption of an unconscious is, moreover, a perfectly <em>legitimate
                </em>one, inasmuch as in postulating it we are not departing a single step from our customary and generally accepted mode of thinking. Consciousness makes each of us aware only of his own states of mind; that other people, too, possess a consciousness is an inference which we draw by analogy from their observable utterances and actions, in order to make this behaviour of theirs intelligible to us. (It would no doubt be psychologically more correct to put it in this way: that without any special reflection we attribute to everyone else our own constitution and therefore our consciousness as well, and that this identification is a <em>sine qua
                    non</em> of our understanding.) This inference (or this identification) was formerly extended by the ego to other human beings, to animals, plants, inanimate objects and to the world at large, and proved serviceable so long as their similarity to the individual ego was overwhelmingly great; but it became more untrustworthy in proportion as the difference between the ego and these ‘others’ widened. To-day, our critical judgement is already in doubt on the question of consciousness in animals; we refuse to admit it in plants and we regard the assumption of its existence in inanimate matter as mysticism. But even where the original inclination to identification has withstood criticism-that is, when the ‘others’ are our fellow-men-the assumption of a consciousness in them rests upon an inference and cannot share the immediate certainty which we have of our own consciousness.</p>
            <p>Psycho-analysis demands nothing more than that we should apply this process of inference to ourselves also-a proceeding to which, it is true, we are not constitutionally inclined. If we do this, we must say: all the acts and manifestations which I notice in myself and do not know how to link up with the rest of my mental life must be judged as if they belonged to someone else: they are to be explained by a mental life ascribed to this other person. Furthermore, experience shows that we understand very well how to interpret in other people (that is, how to fit into their chain of mental events) the same acts which we refuse to acknowledge as being mental in ourselves. Here some special hindrance evidently deflects our investigations from our own self and prevents our obtaining a true knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>This process of inference, when applied to oneself in spite of internal opposition, does not, however, lead to the disclosure of an unconscious; it leads logically to the assumption of another, second consciousness which is united in one’s self with the consciousness one knows. But at this point, certain criticisms may fairly be made. In the first place, a consciousness of which its own possessor knows nothing is something very different from a consciousness belonging to another person, and it is questionable whether such a consciousness, lacking, as it does, its most important characteristic, deserves any discussion at all. Those who have resisted the assumption of an unconscious <em>psychical</em> are not likely to be ready to exchange it for an unconscious <em>consciousness</em>. In the second place, analysis shows that the different latent mental processes inferred by us enjoy a high degree of mutual independence, as though they had no connection with one another, and knew nothing of one another. We must be prepared, if so, to assume the existence in us not only of a second consciousness, but of a third, fourth, perhaps of an unlimited number of states of consciousness, all unknown to us and to one another. In the third place-and this is the most weighty argument of all-we have to take into account the fact that analytic investigation reveals some of these latent processes as having characteristics and peculiarities which seem alien to us, or even incredible, and which run directly counter to the attributes of consciousness with which we are familiar. Thus we have grounds for modifying our inference about ourselves and saying that what is proved is not the existence of a second consciousness in us, but the existence of psychical acts which lack consciousness. We shall also be right in rejecting the term ‘subconsciousness’ as incorrect and misleading. 1 The well-known cases of <em>‘double conscience’2</em> (splitting of consciousness) prove nothing against our view. We may most aptly describe them as cases of a splitting of the mental activities into two groups, and say that the same consciousness turns to one or the other of these groups alternately.<em>
                </em>In psycho-analysis there is no choice for us but to assert that mental processes are in themselves unconscious, and to liken the perception of them by means of consciousness to the perception of the external world by means of the sense-organs. We can even hope to gain fresh knowledge from the comparison. The psycho-analytic assumption of unconscious mental activity appears to us, on the one hand, as a further expansion of the primitive animism which caused us to see copies of our own consciousness all around us, and, on the other hand, as an extension of the corrections undertaken by Kant of our views on external perception. Just as Kant warned us not to overlook the fact that our perceptions are subjectively conditioned and must not be regarded as identical with what is perceived though unknowable, so psycho-analysis warns us not to equate perceptions by means of consciousness with the unconscious mental processes which are their object. Like the physical, the psychical is not necessarily in reality what it appears to us to be. We shall be glad to learn, however, that the correction of internal perception will tum out not to offer such great difficulties as the correction of external perception- that internal objects are less unknowable than the external world.</p>
            <p>II. <em>Various Meanings of ‘the Unconscious’—The Topographical Point of View</em></p>
            <p>Before going any further, let us state the important, though inconvenient, fact that the attribute of being unconscious is only one feature that is found in the psychical and is by no means sufficient fully to characterize it. There are psychical acts of very varying value which yet agree in possessing the characteristic of being unconscious. The unconscious comprises, on the one hand, acts which are merely latent, temporarily unconscious, but which differ in no other respect from conscious ones and, on the other hand, processes such as repressed ones, which if they were to become conscious would be bound to stand out in the crudest contrast to the rest of the conscious processes. It would put an end to all misunderstandings if, from now on, in describing the various kinds of psychical acts we were to disregard the question of whether they were conscious or unconscious, and were to classify and correlate them only according to their relation to instincts and aims, according to their composition and according to which of the hierarchy of psychical systems they belong to. This, however, is for various reasons impracticable, so that we cannot escape the ambiguity of using the words ‘conscious’ and ‘unconscious’ sometimes in a descriptive and sometimes in a systematic sense, in which latter they signify inclusion in particular systems and possession of certain characteristics. We might attempt to avoid confusion by giving the psychical systems which we have distinguished certain arbitrarily chosen names which have no reference to the attribute of being conscious. Only we should first have to specify what the grounds are on which we distinguish the systems, and in doing this we should not be able to evade the attribute of being conscious, seeing that it forms the point of departure for all our investigations. Perhaps we may look for some assistance from the proposal to employ, at any rate in writing, the abbreviation <em>Cs</em>. for consciousness and <em>Ucs</em>. for what is unconscious, when we are using the two words in the systematic sense.</p>
            <p>Proceeding now to an account of the positive findings of psychoanalysis, we may say that in general a psychical act goes through two phases as regards its state, between which is interposed a kind of testing (censorship). In the first phase the psychical act is unconscious and belongs to the system <em>Ucs.;</em> if, on testing, it is rejected by the censorship, it is not allowed to pass into the second phase; it is then said to be ‘repressed’ and must remain unconscious. If, however, it passes this testing, it enters the second phase and thenceforth belongs to the second system, which we will call the system <em>Cs</em>. But the fact that it belongs to that system does not yet unequivocally determine its relation to consciousness. It is not yet conscious, but it is certainly <em>capable of becoming
                    conscious</em> (to use Breuer’s expression)-that is, it can now, given certain conditions, become an object of consciousness without any special resistance. In consideration of this capacity for becoming conscious we also cal! the system <em>Cs</em>. the ‘preconscious’. If it should turn out that a certain censorship also plays a part in determining whether the preconscious becomes conscious, we shall discriminate more sharply between the systems <em>Pes</em>. and <em>Cs</em>. For the present let it suffice us to bear in mind that the system <em>Pes</em>. shares the characteristics of the system <em>Cs</em>. and that the rigorous censorship exercises its office at the point of transition from the <em>Ucs</em>. to the <em>Pcs</em>. (or <em>Cs.).
                </em>By accepting the existence of these two (or three) psychical systems, psycho-analysis has departed a step further from the descriptive ‘psychology of consciousness’ and has raised new problems and acquired a new content. Up till now, it has differed from that psychology mainly by reason of its <em>dynamic</em> view of mental processes; now in addition it seems to take account of psychical <em>topography</em> as well, and to indicate in respect of any given mental act within what system or between what systems it takes place. On account of this attempt, too, it has been given the name of ‘depth-psychology’. We shall hear that it can be further enriched by taking yet another point of view into account.</p>
            <p>If we are to take the topography of mental acts seriously we must direct our interest to a doubt which arises at this point. When a psychical act (let us confine ourselves here to one which is in the nature of an idea) is transposed from the system <em>Ucs</em>. into the system <em>Cs</em>. (or <em>Pcs.)</em>, are we to suppose that this transposition involves a fresh record-as it were, a second registration-of the idea in question, which may thus be situated as well in a fresh psychical locality, and alongside of which the original unconscious registration continues to exist? Or are we rather to believe that the transposition consists in a change in the state of the idea, a change involving the same material and occurring in the same locality? This question may appear abstruse, but it must be raised if we wish to form a more definite conception of psychical topography, of the dimension of depth in the mind. It is a difficult one because it goes beyond pure psychology and touches on the relations of the mental apparatus to anatomy. We know that in the very roughest sense such relations exist. Research has given irrefutable proof that mental activity is bound up with the function of the brain as it is with no other organ. We are taken a step further-we do not know how much-by the discovery of the unequal importance of the different parts of the brain and their special relations to particular parts of the body and to particular mental activities. But every attempt to go on from there to discover a localization of mental processes, every endeavour to think of ideas as stored up in nerve-cells and of excitations as travelling along nervefibres, has miscarried completely. The same fate would await any theory which attempted to recognize, let us say, the anatomical position of the system Cs.—conscious mental activity—as being in the cortex, and to localize the unconscious processes in the subcortical parts of the brain. There is a hiatus here which at present cannot be filled, nor is it one of the tasks of psychology to fill it. Our psychical topography has <em>for the present</em> nothing to do with anatomy; it has reference not to anatomical localities, but to regions in the mental apparatus, wherever they may be situated in the body.</p>
            <p>In this respect, then, our work is untrammelled and may proceed according to its own requirements. It will, however, be useful to remind ourselves that as things stand our hypotheses set out to be no more than graphic illustrations. The first of the two possibilities which we considered- namely, that the <em>Cs</em>. phase of an idea implies a fresh registration of it, which is situated in another place-is doubtless the cruder but also the more convenient. The second hypothesis-that of a merely <em>functional</em> change of state-is <em>a priori</em> more probable, but it is less plastic, less easy to manipulate. With the first, or topographical, hypothesis is bound up that of a topographical separation of the systems <em>Ucs</em>. and <em>Cs</em>. and also the possibility that an idea may exist simultaneously in two places in the mental apparatus-indeed, that if it is not inhibited by the censorship, it regularly advances from the one position to the other, possibly without losing its first location or registration.</p>
            <p>This view may seem odd, but it can be supported by observations from psycho-analytic practice. If we communicate to a patient some idea which he has at one time repressed but which we have discovered in him, our telling him makes at first no change in his mental condition. Above all, it does not remove the repression nor undo its effects, as might perhaps be expected from the fact that the previously unconscious idea has now become conscious. On the contrary, all that we shall achieve at first will be a fresh rejection of the repressed idea. But now the patient has in actual fact the same idea in two forms in different places in his mental apparatus: first, he has the conscious memory of the auditory trace of the idea, conveyed in what we told him; and secondly, he also has-as we know for certain-the unconscious memory of his experience as it was in its earlier form. Actually there is no lifting of the repression until the conscious idea, after the resistances have been overcome, has entered into connection with the unconscious memorytrace. It is only through the making conscious of the latter itself that success is achieved. On superficial consideration this would seem to show that conscious and unconscious ideas are distinct registrations, topographically separated, of the same content. But a moment’s reRection shows that the identity of the information given to the patient with his repressed memory is only apparent. To have heard something and to have experienced something are in their psychological nature two quite different things, even though the content of both is the same.</p>
            <p>So for the moment we are not in a position to decide between the two possibilities that we have discussed. Perhaps later on we shall come upon factors which may turn the balance in favour of one or the other. Perhaps we shall make the discovery that our question was inadequately framed and that the difference between an unconscious and a conscious idea has to be defined in quite another way.</p>
            <p>* * *</p>
            <p>IV. <em>Topography and Dynamics of Repression</em></p>
            <p>We have arrived at the conclusion that repression is essentially a process affecting ideas on the border between the systems <em>Ucs</em>. and <em>Pes. (Cs.)</em>, and we can now make a fresh attempt to describe the process in greater detail.</p>
            <p>It must be a matter of a <em>withdrawal</em> of cathexis: but the question is, in which system does the withdrawal take place and to which system does the cathexis that is withdrawn belong? The repressed idea remains capable of action in the <em>Ucs</em>., and it must therefore have retained its cathexis. What has been withdrawn must be something else. Let us take the case of repression proper (‘after-pressure’), as it affects an idea which is preconscious or even actually conscious. Here repression can only consist in withdrawing from the idea the (pre)conscious cathexis which belongs to the system <em>Pes</em>. The idea then either remains uncathected, or receives cathexis from the <em>Ucs</em>., or retains the <em>Ucs</em>. cathexis which it already had. Thus there is a withdrawal of the preconscious cathexis, retention of the unconscious cathexis, or replacement of the preconscious cathexis by an unconscious one. We notice, moreover, that we have based these reRections (as it were, without meaning to) on the assumption that the transition from the system <em>Ucs</em>. to the system next to it is not effected through the making of a new registration but through a change in its state, an alteration in its cathexis. The functional hypothesis has here easily defeated the topographical one.</p>
            <p>But this process of withdrawal oflibido is not adequate to make another characteristic of repression comprehensible to us. It is not clear why the idea which has remained cathected or has received cathexis from the <em>Ucs</em>. should not, in virtue of its cathexis, renew the attempt to penetrate into the system <em>Pes</em>. If it could do so, the withdrawal of libido from it would have to be repeated, and the same performance would go on endlessly; but the outcome would not be repression. So, too, when it comes to describing <em>primal</em> repression, the mechanism just discussed of withdrawal of preconscious cathexis would fail to meet the case; for here we are dealing with an unconscious idea which has as yet received no cathexis from the <em>Pcs</em>. and therefore cannot have that cathexis withdrawn from it.</p>
            <p>What we require, therefore, is another process which maintains the repression in the first case [i. e. the case of after-pressure] and, in the second [i.e. that of primal repression], ensures its being established as well as continued. This other process can only be found in the assumption of an <em>anticathexis</em>, by means of which the system <em>Pes</em>. protects itself from the pressure upon it of the unconscious idea. We shall see from clinical examples how such an anticathexis, operating in the system <em>Pes</em>., manifests itself. It is this which represents the permanent expenditure [of energy] of a primal repression, and which also guarantees the permanence of that repression. Anticathexis is the sole mechanism of primal repression; in the case of repression proper (,after-pressure’) there is in addition withdrawal of the <em>Pes</em>. cathexis. It is very possible that it is precisely the cathexis which is withdrawn from the idea that is used for anticathexis.</p>
            <p>We see how we have gradually been led into adopting a third point of view in our account of psychical phenomena. Besides the dynamic and the topographical points of view, we have adopted the economic one. This endeavours to follow out the vicissitudes of amounts of excitation and to arrive at least at some <em>relative</em> estimate of their magnitude.</p>
            <p>It will not be unreasonable to give a special name to this whole way of regarding our subject-matter, for it is the consummation of psychoanalytic research. I propose that when we have succeeded in describing a psychical process in its dynamic, topographical and economic aspects, we should speak of it as a <em>metapsychologicaI</em> presentation. We must say at once that in the present state of our knowledge there are only a few points at which we shall succeed in this.</p>

            <p>V. <em>The Special Characteristics of the System Ucs</em>.</p>
            <p>The distinction we have made between the two psychical systems receives fresh significance when we observe that processes in the one system, the <em>Ucs</em>., show characteristics which are not met with again in the system immediately above it.</p>
            <p>The nucleus of the <em>Ucs</em>. consists of instinctual representatives which seek to discharge their cathexis; that is to say, it consists of wishful impulses. These instinctual impulses are co-ordinate with one another, exist side by side without being influenced by one another, and are exempt from mutual contradiction. When two wishful impulses whose aims must appear to us incompatible become simultaneously active, the two impulses do not diminish each other or cancel each other out, but combine to form an intermediate aim, a compromise.</p>
            <p>There are in this system no negation, no doubt, no degrees of certainty: all this is only introduced by the work of the censorship between the <em>Ucs</em>. and the <em>Pes</em>. Negation is a substitute, at a higher level, for repression. In the <em>Ucs</em>. there are only contents, cathected with greater or lesser strength.</p>
            <p>The cathectic intensities [in the <em>Ucs</em>.] are much more mobile. By the process of <em>displacement</em> one idea may surrender to another its whole quota of cathexis; by the process of <em>condensation</em> it may appropriate the whole cathexis of several other ideas. I have proposed to regard these two processes as distinguishing marks of the so-called <em>primary psychical process</em>. In the system <em>Pes</em>. the <em>secondary process</em> is dominant. When a primary process is allowed to take its course in connection with elements belonging to the system <em>Pes</em>., it appears’ comic’ and excites laughter.</p>
            <p>The processes of the system <em>Ucs</em>. are <em>timeless;</em> i.e. they are not ordered temporally, are not altered by the passage of time; they have no reference to time at all. Reference to time is bound up, once again, with the work of the system <em>Cs</em>.</p>
            <p>The <em>Ucs</em>. processes pay just a little regard to <em>reality</em>. They are subject to the pleasure principle; their fate depends only on how strong they are and on whether they fulfil the demands of the pleasure-unpleasure regulation.</p>
            <p>To sum up: <em>exemption from mutual contradiction, primary process</em> (mobility of cathexes), <em>timelessness</em>, and <em>replacement of external by psychical reality---these</em> are the characteristics which we may expect to find in processes belonging to the system <em>Ucs.
                </em>Unconscious processes only become cognizable by us under the conditions of dreaming and of neurosis-that is to say, when the processes of the higher, <em>Pes</em>., system are set back to an earlier stage by being lowered (by regression). In themselves they cannot be cognized, indeed are even incapable of carrying on their existence; for the system <em>Ucs</em>. is at a very early moment overlaid by the <em>Pes</em>. which has taken over access to consciousness and to motility. Discharge from the system <em>Ucs</em>. passes into somatic innervation that leads to development of affect; but even this path of discharge is, as we have seen, contested by the <em>Pes</em>. By itself, the system <em>Ucs</em>. would not in normal conditions be able to bring about any expedient muscular acts, with the exception of those already organized as reflexes.</p>
            <p>The full significance of the characteristics of the system <em>Ues</em>. described above could only be appreciated by us if we were to contrast and compare them with those of the system <em>Pes</em>. But this would take us so far afield that I propose that we should once more call a halt and not undertake the comparison of the two till we can do so in connection with our discussion of the higher system. Only the most pressing points of all will be mentioned at this stage.</p>
            <p>The processes of the system <em>Pes</em>. display-no matter whether they are already conscious or only capable of becoming conscious—an inhibition of the tendency of cathected ideas towards discharge. When a process passes from one idea to another, the first idea retains a part of its cathexis and only a small portion undergoes displacement. Displacements and condensations such as happen in the primary process are excluded or very much restricted. This circumstance caused Breuer to assume the existence of two different states of cathectic energy in mental life: one in which the energy is tonically ‘bound’ and the other in which it is freely mobile and presses towards discharge. In my opinion this distinction represents the deepest insight we have gained up to the present into the nature of nervous energy, and I do not see how we can avoid making it. A meta psychological presentation would most urgently call for further discussion at this point, though perhaps that would be too daring an undertaking as yet.</p>
            <p>Further, it devolves upon the system <em>Pes</em>. to make communication possible between the different ideational contents so that they can influence one another, to give them an order in time, and to set up a censorship or several censorships; ‘reality-testing’ too, and the realityprinciple, are in its province. Conscious memory, moreover, seems to depend wholly on the <em>Pes</em>. This should be clearly distinguished from the memory-traces in which the experiences of the <em>Ues</em>. are fixed, and probably corresponds to a special registration such as we proposed (but later rejected) to account for the relation of conscious to unconscious ideas. In this connection, also, we shall find means for putting an end to our oscillations in regard to the naming of the higher system-which we have hitherto spoken of indifferently, sometimes as the <em>Pes</em>. and sometimes as the <em>Cs</em>.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be out of place here to utter a warning against any overhasty generalization of what we have brought to light concerning the distribution of the various mental functions between the two systems. We are describing the state of affairs as it appears in the adult human being, in whom the system <em>Ues</em>. operates, strictly speaking, only as a preliminary stage of the higher organization. The question of what the content and connections of that system are during the development of the individual, and of what significance it possesses in animals—these are points on which no conclusion can be deduced from our description: they must be investigated independently. Moreover, in human beings we must be prepared to find possible pathological conditions under which the two systems alter, or even exchange, both their content and their characteristics.</p>
