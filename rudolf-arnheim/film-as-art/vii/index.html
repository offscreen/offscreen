        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">1938: A New Laocoon: Artistic Composites and the Talking Film</h2>
        <p>The following inquiry was suggested by a feeling of uneasiness that every talking film arouses in the author and that is not appeased by increased acquaintance with the new medium. It is a feeling that something is not right there: that we are dealing with productions which because of intrinsic contradictions of principle are incapable of true existence. Apparently the uneasiness is due to the spectator’s attention being torn in two directions. In their attempts to attract the audience, two media are fighting each other instead of capturing it by united effort. Since the two media are striving to express the same matter in a twofold way, a discqncerting coincidence of two voices results, each of which is prevented by the other from telling more than half of what it would like to tell.</p>
        <p>This practical situation called for a theoretical study of the aesthetic laws whose violation made the talking film so unsatisfactory. Such an undertaking seemed all the more urgent since I had come to suspect that the principles commonly used in discussions of the subject were wrong or at least wrongly applied. The point had been reached at which the persons concerned, at best, endeavored to interpret the nature of the new medium but had stopped asking the more basic question of whether its very existence was admissible or not. In fact, to bring up this question was considered by now offensive, defeatist, reactionary. All the more pressing seemed to me the need of trying to finally clear up the problem.</p>
        <p>For this purpose I set out to investigate the conditions under which, quite in general, works of art can be based upon more than one medium—such as the spoken word, the image in motion, the musical sound—and what the range, nature, and value of such works might be. The result of this necessarily sketchy exploration was then applied to the talking film.</p>
        <p><em>The theater successfully combines image and speech</em>. —The two elements whose rivalry the motion picture cannot reconcile are, of course, image and speech. It <em>is</em> a surprising rivalry, if we remember that in daily life talk rarely keeps us from seeing, or seeing from listening. But as soon as we sit in front of the movie screen we notice such disturbances. Probably we react differently because we are not used to finding in the image of the real world the kind of formal precision that in the work of art presents—by means of the sensory data—the subject and its qualities in a clear-cut, expressive way. Normally we gather from the world that surrounds us little more than vague hints, sufficient for practical orientation. Physical reality shapes and assembles things and events only in approximation of the pure, authentic “<span>ideas</span>” that are at the bottom of the empirical world. The imprecision of a color, the discord in a composition of lines do not necessarily interfere with our perception when we are observing for practical purposes only; and the literary impurity of a sentence may not prevent us from understanding its meaning. Therefore, when in everyday life an unbalanced combination of visual and auditory elements fails to produce discomfort, we need not be surprised either. In the realm of art, on the contrary, the unsure expression of an object, the inconsistency of a movement, a badly put phrase will impair at once the effect, the meaning, the beauty conveyed by the work. This is why a combination of media that has no unity will appear intolerable.</p>
        <p>It seems unlikely that the union of the image in motion and the spoken word as such is the cause of the discomfort created by the “<span>talkies</span>”; for such compounding of the two media seems sanctioned by the theater, surely an ancient and most fruitful art. Perhaps the mistake lies in the particular way the talking film employs the time-honored combination. As a matter of fact, even the theater has been accused now and then of being basically a hybrid. Some critics have pointed out that throughout its history the theater has oscillated between two extreme procedures, which would entrust the entire production either to the visible action on the stage or to the dialogue. It may be, therefore, that the theater is trying constantly to solve an insoluble inner conflict by leaning toward one of the two purer forms of expression of which it is a mixture: the mere image in motion—as we have it in the dance—or the mere spoken word, recently used to perfection in certain radio plays. To be sure, such leaning of the theater toward the pure and extreme forms would not necessarily prove that their mixture is inadmissible. One of the most basic artistic impulses derives from man’s yearning to escape the disturbing multiplicity of nature and seeks, therefore, to depict this bewildering reality with the simplest means. For this reason a medium of expression that is capable of producing complete works by its own resources will forever keep up its resistance against any combination with another medium. In the theater, then, such a tendency toward a more unified and thereby simpler medium is manifest—a tendency to attain more elementary and in a certain sense more immediately striking effects through pure visual action or pure dialogue. However, the stage director realizes also that by combining the more concrete and relatively simpler visual medium with the more abstract and complex medium of speech richer works can be produced, which may render human life more completely. For this reason he sacrifices himself to some extent—a sacrifice that often will be hard precisely on the kind of man who has the true theater blood: he imposes upon his theatrical instinct his will to function as a mere servant of the playwright’s work, which he agrees to interpret, to enrich, to make more tangible. In order to succeed he must conquer his lively inclination toward the “<span>absolute</span>” theater, that is, the kind of performance that is sheer stage action. Such pantomime, by the way, has remained sterile whenever it was attempted and must remain so unless it be stylized to the point of becoming dance or so enriched visually as to become film.</p>
        <p><em>Parallelism of complete and segregated representations</em>. —The enrichment and unity that may result in art from the cooperation of several media are not identical with the fusion of all sorts of sense perception that is typical for our way of experiencing the “<span>real</span>” world. Because in art the diversity of the various perceptual media requires separations among them— separations that only a higher unity can overcome.</p>
        <p>Obviously it would be senseless and inconceivable to try to fuse visual and auditory elements artistically in the same way in which one sentence is tied to the next, one motion to the other. For instance, the unity that exists in real life between the body and the voice of a person would be valid in a work of art only if there existed between the two components a kinship much more intrinsic than their belonging together biologically. The artist conceives and forms his image of the world through directly perceivable sensory qualities, such as colors, shapes, sounds, movements. The expressive features of these percepts serve to interpret the meaning and character of the subject. The essence of the subject must be manifest in what can be observed directly. On this (lower) level of the sensory phenomena, however, an artistic connection of visual and auditory phenomena is not possible. (One cannot put a sound in a painting!) Such a connection can be made only at a second, higher level, namely at the level of the so-called expressive qualities. A dark red wine can have the same expression as the dark sound of a violoncello, but no formal connection can be established between the red and the sound as purely perceptual phenomena. At the second level, then, a compounding of elements that derive from disparate sensory realms becomes possible artistically.</p>
        <p>Such compounding, however, must respect the segregations established at the lower level. It presupposes. in fact, that in each of the sensory areas concerned a closed and complete structure has been formed on that lower plane—a structure that in its own way and by itself must present the total subject of the work of art. When at the second level the purely material barrier disappears, the elements deriving from the different areas (for instance, the visual and the auditory) must nevertheless preserve the groupings and segregations established at the primary level. On the other hand, they may take advantage of the way they resemble each other or contrast with each other as far as expression is concerned and thus create interrelationships. For instance, all the movements of a group of dancers remain unified among one another and, together, segregated from the accompanying music. Within the musical structure also all sounds are interconnected. But the similarity of the expression conveyed by the patterns of the two sensory areas makes it possible to combine them in one unitary work of art. For example, a certain gesture of one of the dancers may resemble a corresponding musical phrase with regard to expression and meaning . . . just as the gesture of an actor may correspond to the meaning of the sentence he is uttering.</p>
        <p>The combination of several means of expression in a work of art provides us with a formal device whose particular virtue lies in that at the second structural level a relationship is established among patterns that are complete, closed, and strictly segregated at the lower or primary level. In addition to the two levels I have mentioned there may be others, higher ones— in fact, there almost always are—but they are less important. One of them concerns the characteristics of the objects represented in the work of art inasmuch as they belong to our real physical world, for example, the practical, material connections between the human body and the human voice. This level is closer to everyday life and the relations created at it are, therefore, more obvious to our common sense. But the kind of connection established at this level between patterns from different perceptual areas is not sufficient to make them homogeneous, fusable, or exchangeable. Their disparity at the primary level is in the way. For what happens at the primary level is binding for the entire work.</p>
        <p>(It will be understood that the relationships between elements of the physical world can go beyond mere coincidence in time and space. The body and the voice of a person, for example, are not just accidental neighbors who otherwise have nothing in common. Rather, since they belong to the same organism, they are intimately related also as far as their expression goes—a similarity that makes the physical connection of that body and that voice more meaningful. But neither in art nor in reality is such empirical kinship always accompanied by a kinship of expression; nor is similarity of expression found only in things that belong together empirically.)</p>
        <p>The objection may be raised that literature uses all the senses—sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste—liberally mixed and just as inseparably fused as we experience them in everyday life. This objection, however, can be made validly only by someone who believes that the words of the writer are nothing but a means of arousing, in the mind of the reader, memory images supposed to replace the direct perceptual sensations, which the writer cannot provide. (Thus Schopenhauer: “<span>The simplest and correctest definition of poetry seems to me to be that poetry is the art of stimulating the power of imagination by means of words</span>”) But is it true that literary language is nothing better than the kind of expedient to which, for instance, the writer of film scripts must resort when he wants to describe the scenes of a film to be made? Is the word only transitional or is it rather the final form of the literary creation? Does not the particular nature of literature consist precisely in the abstract-ness of language, which calls every object by the collective name of its species and therefore defines it only in a generic way, without reaching the object itself in its individual concreteness? It is from this particularity that literature draws its most characteristic and strongest effects. The poetical word refers directly to the meaning, the character, the structure of things; hence the spiritual quality of its vision, the acuteness and succinctness of its descriptions. The writer is not tied to the physical concreteness of a given setting; therefore, he is free to connect one object with another even though in actuality the two may not be neighbors either in time or in space. And since he uses as his material not the actual percept but its conceptual name, he can compose his images of elements that are taken from disparate sensory sources. He does not have to worry whether the combinations he creates are possible or even imaginable in the physical world. When Goethe, in one of his poems, calls the oak tree a towering giant dressed in a garment of fog, he uses of “<span>tower</span>” only the tallness, of “<span>giant</span>” only the massiveness, of “<span>garment</span>” only the function of covering—something no painter could do. The writer operates on what I called the second or higher level, at which the visual and auditory arts also discover their kinship. We understand now why the writer can fuse the rustling of the wind, the sailing of the clouds, the odor of rotting leaves, and the touch of raindrops on the skin into one genuine unity.</p>
        <p>It is true that, in a different sense, the writer also reaches the level of immediate concreteness so that he, too, can profit from its animating virtues. He cannot make us see, hear, smell, or touch the things he evokes, but the words he uses to name them are sounds, that is, auditory material. The expression conveyed by the sequences of vowels and consonants, the rhythm of stresses, the legates, and the caesuras make it possible for him to say in the different and more concrete medium of sound what at the same time he is also saying through concepts. In this sense, any literary work is in itself a composite, and thus subject to the rules we are exploring.</p>
        <p><em>The conditions for the combination of artistic media</em>. —Artistic media combine, I asserted before, as separate and complete structural forms. The theme to be expressed by a song, for instance, is given in the words of the text and again, in another manner, in the sounds of the music. Both elements conform to each other in such a way as to create the unity of the whole, but their separateness remains evident, nevertheless. Their combination resembles a successful marriage, where similarity and adaptation make for unity but where the personality of the two partners remains intact, nevertheless. It does <em>not</em> resemble the child that springs from such a marriage, in whom both components are inseparably mixed.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in a theatrical performance the visible action and the dialogue must each present the total subject. If there is a gap in one of the two components it cannot be made up by the other. It is the duty of the director to interpret the content of the dialogue for the eyes of the audience through color, shape, and motion, through the appearance and gestures of the actors, through the spatial organization of the setting and the way the bodies move within this space. The visual performance cannot be interrupted, except if the gap serves as a delimiting interval, that is, a caesura, which does not break up the action but is a part of it. The visible action must never be permitted to become inexpressive or empty for the benefit of the dialogue because even the most substantial lines of speech could not make up for such a deficiency: they could not mend a visual gap. In the same way, an interruption of the dialogue can only take the form of an interval; it cannot be justified as a temporary shift from audible to visible action. There can be, of course, a contrapuntal opposition of a rest in the pantomime against a simultaneous exchange of heated retorts in the dialogue, or of a moment of silence against a significant piece of pantomimic action—but only in the sense in which the harmonic play of a piece of music is enriched by the frequent exits and entrances of the various voices or instruments.</p>
        <p><em>The dialogue must be complete</em>. —Enough has been said to make it clear that there <em>is</em> little justification for a current fad on the part of some “<span>highbrow</span>” film directors who have the action carried almost entirely by the visual performance on the screen and only here and there add a touch of dialogue to the dramatic development. Such a procedure evidently does not create a parallelism between two complete components, namely, a very dense visual part and a very “<span>porous</span>” auditory one: instead the dialogue is fragmentary; it consists of pieces that are separated by unbridgeable interruptions. The expressed intention of these directors is to have speech emerge, in certain highspots, as a kind of condensation of the visual image. The distinction of the media is entirely neglected, and as a result scraps of speech pop up with a ludicrous surprise effect, out of empty auditory space, in which they float without anchor. The defect cannot be eliminated by filling the stretches of silence with appropriate noises or music; for the example of the song has taught us already that even within the realm of auditory art, music and speech can be combined only when a parallelism between two complete and segregated components—a poem and a melody— is provided. If the dialogue were not dispersed in pieces but collected in large complexes, each of which were a closed and continuous structure, one could at least refer to the great example of Beethoven’s <em>Ninth Symphony</em>, and the later similar attempt by Mahler, in which at the climax of the composition the instrumental music <em>is</em> completed by human voices so that from that moment on the work proceeds on a broader, more monumental base. However, in the talking film even that device would not help because there still would remain the obstacle of the difference in visual style between the silent scenes and those completed with dialogue.</p>
        <p>The practical experience of what goes on in the movie theater would demonstrate to everybody that a true fusion of word and image is impossible if the image on the screen were ever shut off so that the dialogue could try to “<span>take over</span>”. The visual action is always complete—at least technically, although not artistically. The complete visual action accompanied by occasional dialogue represents a partial parallelism, not a fusion. The fragmentary nature of the dialogue is the fundamental defect. (To be sure, an interruption of the dialogue does not produce the same kind of psychological shock that would result from a sudden disappearance of the image from the screen. The reason is that, psychologically, a stop of the dialogue is not perceived as an interruption of the auditory action, the way the disappearance of the image from the screen would interrupt the visual performance. Silence <em>is</em> not necessarily experienced as the removal of the world of sound but rather as a neutral foil—empty but ‘positive’ as the plain background of a portrait is a part of the picture. However, a phenomenon may not disturb us in a purely psychological sense and still be objectionable artistically.)</p>
        <p>Those patches of speech are of little theoretical importance as long as they represent merely the minimum concession of a film director who has to meet the demands for dialogue on the part of producers and distributors. For in that case the film maker thinks of his work as a silent film, that is, as a film in the true meaning of the term, adulterated by a hostile principle (that imposes the talking upon the artist). If, however, he believes that simply by reducing the amount of speech and thus moving away from the style of the theater he approaches a new and autonomous art form, namely, the “<span>talking film</span>”, he demonstrates his lack of professional sensibility. The fewer words are used and the more definitely the burden of the action is carried by the image on the screen, the more disturbing, alien, and ridiculous will the speech fragments appear; it will be all the more evident that what is being used is the traditional style of the silent film—but in an impure fashion.</p>
        <p>In comparison, the approach of the more modest craftsmen who work in the studios at the service of the film industry is artistically saner. By their daily contact with their medium they have attained some intuitive understanding of its intrinsic requirements, and for that reason—at least partly—they tend toward the “<span>100 per cent dialogue</span>” film. In these productions, speech accompanies the film throughout its length, more or less without gaps, and in that way fulfills one of the elementary conditions for the compounding of m$dia, namely, parallelism. In the average film of that kind one notices, in addition, an ever more radical curtailment of the means of visual expression as they were developed during the period of the silent movies. This tendency also derives, as I am going to show, from the aesthetic conditions created by the talking film. Even so, the disequilibrium between image and speech is not avoided by this procedure nor does it create artistically valid sound films. Instead, the studio practice moves toward the traditional style of the theater without being ready to renounce the novel charms of the moving picture.</p>
        <p>In any case, complete dialogue would be the basic premise for any use of speech in film—an artistically complete and closed word pattern. We need to inquire now whether or not this condition can be met by a technique that would be different in principle from that of the theater.</p>
        <p><em>Can image and word be combined in a manner different from that of the theater?</em>—The specialty of such a new art form might be based on some fundamental difference between theater action and film action, as far as the visual part of the performance is concerned. Commonly it is taken for granted that such a difference does exist and is demonstrated by actual practice. And yet there is no fundamental reason why the distinguishing traits of the film image should be denied to the theater. Unquestionably, the theater as an art form would remain essentially what it is if the flesh-and-blood actor were replaced with his photographic image: the theater performances on television prove it. The theater also could substitute black-and-white for natural color—and, of course, monochrome is no essential characteristic of the movies anyway. The displacement of the entire picture, as produced by traveling shots in film, has recently been obtained also in the theater through rotating stages and similar devices—more modestly, to be sure, but matters of degree count little for distinctions in principle. The modern theater has also used actual film projections, for instance, as backdrops. Granted that in its present form the theater cannot change the distance or the angle of view, nor can it leap from place to place as the film does by means of montage. But here again we merely need to think of television in order to realize that what is technically impossible for the theater as we know it today may be familiar tomorrow.</p>
        <p>In this connection we might as well realize that film is art, yes, but not an entirely new and isolated art. The art of the moving image <em>is</em> distinct from that of the static image, as we have it in painting or sculpture. However, it comprises not only the film but also dance and pantomime; and the question is at least debatable whether or not the properties that film derives from the technique of mechanical registration are weightier than the others it shares with dance, pantomime, and therefore also with the theater. One thing seems certain: if one tries to ignore the properties that the film shares with other media—as has been done <em>ad majorem gloriam</em> of the movies—one cannot hope correctly to evaluate the art of the film. The art of the moving image is as old as the other arts, it is as old as humanity itself, and the motion picture is but its most recent manifestation. What is more, I would venture to predict that the film will be able to reach the heights of the other arts only when it frees itself from the bonds of photographic reproduction and becomes a pure work of man, namely, as animated cartoon or painting.</p>
        <p>There is, then, no difference in principle between the visual action of the theater and the moving image of the film. Therefore, the experiences made with the “<span>enriched image</span>” in the theater can be directly applied to the talking film. What are these experiences? They show that attempts at “<span>enrichment</span>” have quickly turned out to be deviations from serious stage art. When the designer indulges in dazzling contrivances and the director crowds the stage with action, the visual performance distracts from the words of the playwright rather than interprets them.</p>
        <p>Of course, this contention presupposes that the stage performance has the purpose of providing the dialogue with its due position in the foreground while leaving to the image only a secondary, supporting function. We need now to explore the possibility of other artistic forms that might do without this presupposition.</p>
        <p>The simpler the wording of the dialogue, the less likely the audience will be kept from following the dramatic conversation attentively. Now a work of dramatic literature, just as any other work of art, can assume any degree of density—from the intricate and heavy thought of a Shakespeare, who presents our receptive powers with almost insoluble tasks even when there is nothing visual at all to distract us from the recital (as, for example, in radio performances), to the loosest lines of plainest concreteness. The simpler forms of dialogue—which might not be less valuable literarily—could receive a richer visual presentation without suffering from it. Perhaps the history of literature offers few examples of such simple dialogue, but conceivably this could change if the playwright got used to the idea of seeing his works completed by a richer stage action. In fact, perhaps the writer himself might undertake the task of working in both media, that is, of creating by himself the twofold total work. Let us assume this happened and the scales tipped gradually in favor of the visual action: we should then arrive first at works in which the audible and the visible were in balance, and finally at others in which the picture predominated whereas the dialogue would accept a secondary function, similar to that reserved nowadays for the pantomimic action on the theater stage.</p>
        <p> Would productions of this latter kind belong to a new and autochthonous species of art? Could a mere quantitative shift of the components give birth to a new art form? The performance of a large group of dancers may be accompanied by nothing but one flute or, conversely, the solo of one dancer may be accompanied by a whole symphony orchestra . . . are we dealing with different art forms? There would be no particular hurry in deciding whether we were faced with a mere variety of theater art or rather with a special form all of its own—if only the indicated shift of elements would give us new ways of representing our life, new ways of saying things for which so far there is no tongue. All depends now on deciding whether or not the procedure that we have drawn up in theory is capable of life in practice.</p>
        <p><em>Specific characteristics of various artistic media</em>. —Earlier I explained that the compounding of different media—for example, moving picture and speech— cannot be justified simply by the fact that in the experience of everyday life visual and auditory elements are intimately connected and, in fact, inseparably fused. There must be artistic reasons for such a combination: it must serve to express something that could not be said by one of the media alone. We found that a composite work of art is possible only if complete structures, produced by the media, are integrated in the form of parallelism. Naturally, such a “<span>double track</span>” will make sense only if the components do not simply convey the same thing. They must complete each other in the sense of dealing differently with the same subject. Each medium must treat the subject in its own way, and the resulting differences must be in accordance with those that exist between the media.</p>
        <p>That the various media are different in character has been shown in Lessing’s <em>Laocoon</em> by the example of the visual arts and literature. In distinguishing, for example, between representational and nonrepresenta-tional media one understands easily that painting or the dance—as contrasted with music—may convey underlying themes in a more indirect and hidden manner. The representation is tied to tangible objects but precisely for this reason more in keeping with practical experience. Music transmits such ideas more directly, more purely and forcefully, but its interpretation, which can do without depicting objects, is also more abstract and generic since it excludes the multitude of concrete things and happenings. This <em>is</em> why music completes the dance and the silent film so perfectly: it vigorously transmits the feelings and moods and also the inherent rhythm of movements that the visual performance would wish to describe but which are accessible to it only through the inevitable diffraction and turbidity deriving from the use of concrete objects.</p>
        <p>There is no point in comparing the relative value of the various media. Personal preferences exist, but each medium reaches the heights in its own way. If we call literature the most complete medium of all, we have to remember, nevertheless, that this universality makes also for weaknesses, where other media show particular strength. But as far as content goes, the word has the range of all the other media together: it can describe the things of this world as immobile or as constantly changing; with inimitable ease it can leap from one place to the other, from one moment to the next; it presents not only the world of our outer senses but also the entire realm of the soul, the imagination, the emotion, the; will. And not only does the word capture these external and internal facts in themselves —it also includes the logical and the intuitive connections that the human mind establishes between them. It can present objects at almost any degree of abstractness: from individual concreteness to rarefied generality. It can swing back and forth between percept and concept and thereby satisfy the most earthly as well as the most spiritual demands. And particularly it is at home on the attractive meeting ground of phenomenon and idea, where the poet operates.</p>
        <p><em>Visual action as a useful complement of the dramatic dialogue</em>. —Even so, at the one extreme of the scale that leads from percept to concept, language cannot go beyond a certain degree of approximation. It cannot materialize things to the point of presenting us with their material nature itself. It can say “<span>color</span>” but cannot show us color. Hence the practice of completing the spoken dialogue with stage action and stories with illustrations. At the same time we understand that such a completion is not necessary. The writer can describe to us any object with the degree of precision required for his artistic purpose.</p>
        <p>A play, therefore, does not require staging—it merely permits it. Accordingly, the sets as well as the motions of the actors should humbly yield the limelight to the dramatic work, which is complete in itself. The production comes into being only after the poet has finished his work, freely and without much consideration. The stage action gives body to the indirect vision conveyed by the poet. Colors, shapes, and noises serve the simpler and more elementary experience of the senses, which is welcome to the audience and to which the poet himself pays tribute with the sound and rhythm of his words. Sound and image are primordial art, closer to nature than the rendering by concepts. Music, painting, sculpture, architecture, dance, and film appeal to the more primitive side of the human mind. Although enlightened by speech, man nevertheless cherishes these ancient resources and their vigorously simple interpretation of what he has to say.</p>
        <p>Being more concrete and biologically older, the image can produce the more massive effects, so that the word is threatened when the picture, and particularly the moving picture, presents itself. A good stage production endeavors to tone down the natural dominance of the visible performance by keeping it at a certain distance from the Audience and by restricting the amount of action on the stage.</p>
        <p><em>Could not the visual action become an integral part of the play?</em>—In the theater, the visual action is, then, a servant of the dialogue. On the other hand, it does not simply repeat what the playwright says or could say. By presenting the subject in a particular way, which is not accessible to literature, the visual action satisfies one of the conditions for the combination of media. This being so, is it not conceivable that in certain cases language might seem an insufficient instrument for the artist who creates for the tlieater? Are there not things he could not express in words but only through stage action? So that he might find it necessary to use both media?</p>
        <p>Playwrights include in their plays references to the external stage action to varying degrees. There is, on the one hand, the kind of poet who concentrates entirely on internal action. All he wishes to present is the clash of psychical forces, expressed in the words of the dialogue. Probably there are few actual examples of this extreme case, although the radio play tends to develop in this direction. At the opposite pole we find a kind of play that might consist of nothing but external action—which would change the playwright into a narrator of pantomime.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, two ways by which the writer may put in his play necessary references to external action. The classical procedure of the great dramatists is that of including them in the dialogue itself. In addition, we find, generally, also stage directions, which describe the setting and what is going on in it. Directions may be rare and short, as in the classics, or—as in some modern plays—they may grow into lengthy descriptions of the type found in novels. However, they do not necessarily have to be considered as a second medium. We are not dealing here with an invasion of visual action into playwriting but rather with the adoption of techniques of fiction. There is a recognizable difference between the literary description of visual action and attempts to describe in words something to be produced visually. In the latter case, as we know from the technique of the film scriptwriter, words are used as a mere expedient. When a poet describes a painting, the result is not a painting, and is not intended to be one. On the other hand, an attempt to fixate with words a piece of visual action, simply because no other means of recording is available, will easily turn out to be absurd literarily and to make excessive demands on the visual imagination of the reader, even though the description may come from a gifted writer. As an example I will translate a piece by the eighteenth-century writer G. Ch. Lichten-berg, who tried to preserve in words the great Garrick’s interpretation of the scene in which Hamlet sees the ghost of his father. “<span>Garrick turns suddenly around and at the same moment falls two or three steps backward with his knees apart; his hat drops to the floor; both of his arms, and particularly the left, are raised, the left hand is at the height of the head, the right arm is more bent, the right hand lower, the fingers are spread out and the mouth is open; thus he stops, as though paralyzed, in the midst of a large but not excessive step, supported by his friends, who are more familiar with the apparition and fear he may collapse; in his face, horror is expressed in such a way that it made me shiver even before he began to speak</span>”.</p>
        <p>If, then, there is a genuine difference between the literary description of visual matter and the recording in words of things belonging in a nonliterary, visual medium, is it not possible that a writer may find it necessary to have his dramatic dialogue completed by—not just accompanied with—a specific kind of visual staging? This indeed would be a basically new type of art, as shown also by the fact that the author himself would have to take care in detail of the visual production since it would represent “<span>the other half</span>” of his work itself rather than simply a subsequent “<span>performance</span>” of it.</p>
        <p><em>So far, artists have preferred the singular medium</em>,— The great artists, whose activity represents, as it were, the practical manifestation of the aesthetic laws, have shown little inclination thus far to make use of such a possibility. Shakespeare lived in daily contact with the world of the theater, but Goethe could say of him, nevertheless, that he was not a theater writer and did not think of the theater when he wrote. There is, in fact, no more radical way than his of anticipating every possible stage effect and, therefore, to make an adequate stage performance in our sense impossible. Similarly, the plays of Moliere, Goethe, Schiller, Goldoni—all theater people—are complete even on paper, and the same is true for the Greek classics. Certain plays, in which the descriptions of the setting, the characters, and the action make up a considerable part of the text—for example. <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, or Kleist’s <em>Penthesilea</em>—seem practically un-stageable because the poet’s words create images so powerful and phantastic that it may be considered ridiculous to try to match them or even improve on them in the production.</p>
        <p>In the entire recorded history of art we find only one example of some weight that involves not just the secondary addition of one medium to the other but, to some extent, the collective effort of two media, namely, the opera. If we examine it, however, we find that in practice one of the components, the musical, dominates decisively. In fact, the libretto is a mere vehicle for the purposes of the music. Often it is put together strictly according to the needs of the composer, and its literary value tends to be slight. It is not essential for the true substance of the opera and serves mainly to explain the plot and to make a stage production possible. (The work of Richard Wagner approaches an equilibrium of music and libretto, but this work is so debatable and so strongly influenced by theory that by itself it does not represent a valid counterargument.) In fact, historically, the coming about of the opera probably represents not so much a union of music and literature but the conquest of the dramatic element on the part of music, which is otherwise limited to the lyrical style. Generated by the attempts of the fifteenth century to enhance, through music, the dramatic and spectacular qualities of the tragedies in the Greek manner, it actually satisfies the wish to express musically the strivings and emotions of man in action and the situations of conflict or harmony that arise from social intercourse. Dialogue is used as a technical and secondary means to make the human actor audible in the most natural way and to develop the plot beyond those elementary themes that can be made comprehensible by the moving image of pantomime plus music alone. In other words, the opera is an almost entirely musical form, and the dialogue is limited more or less to the task of the printed “<span>titles</span>” in silent movies.</p>
        <p>It is worth remembering here also that great actors often prefer mediocre plays that allow them to work almost by improvisation and thus to reserve the performance essentially to the expression of body and voice; whereas, on the other hand, their genius often spells danger to die great works of dramatic literature. Similarly, good dancers and the makers of silent films have a preference for simple, clear-cut music, which may not be first-rate.</p>
        <p>All these facts taken together suggest that up to now artists have shown little capacity or inclination to produce works genuinely based on more than one medium. To be sure, in all the examples cited more than one medium is actually used, but as a rule a different person takes care of each medium, and one of them assumes the lead: the dominant medium develops a rich structure from the theme sustained more simply by the secondary medium. Not that the secondary medium should ever be neglected to the point of being cheap, or smothered to the extent of being unable to make its point. Art admits a hierarchy of function but does not tolerate the qualitative or quantitative atrophy of any component, once it is included.</p>
        <p><em>The hierarchy of media in the work of art</em>. —In composite works, the various media—as well as the artists who take care of them—seem to form hierarchies. The dramatic productions of antiquity illustrate this best. In them the word of the poet dominates, but it is complemented by stage action, which broadly outlines the dramatic events, and also by music. Another example may be found in the medieval cathedral, where the architectonic structure is enriched by painting and sculpture. Add to this the presence and participation of the theater audience and the religious congregation, and you have art as an all-embracing ritual rather than as the isolated object it becomes at a late stage of civilization. These hierarchic productions tend to be, as we pointed out, the work not of one but of several persons, and in order truly to succeed such a collaboration is likely to presuppose a spiritual community, that is, in the more general sense: the existence of a cult. The individual artist, on the other hand, tends to conceive the world in one medium only.</p>
        <p>The cooperation of several artists helps to overcome the discrepancy of the different perceptual media. Each artist can limit himself to one sensory universe. The total product may turn out to be incoherent, of course, particularly when no medium takes the lead decisively and instead there <em>is</em> an approximate equilibrium of two or more of them. This happens, for instance, in certain songs. Like the opera, the song is an essentially musical form. But when the poem that has been set to music succeeds in attracting considerable attention in its own right, the balance between music and poetry seems unstable. Such a rivalry among the media may keep the listener from making real contact with the work: he may not get beyond enjoying the rather formalistic fascination deriving from the consonance of similar yet heterogeneous components.</p>
        <p><em>Possible advantages of the film dialogue</em>. —We have now worked out some fundamental concepts, which can be useful in judging the talking film. From what I have said it follows that, first of all, there should be a dominant medium. This part would fall to the moving image since predominance of the word would lead to the theater. The question is, then, whether the art of the animated image, which has been developed as the silent film, could use the kind of libretto through which the opera provides a skeleton of the dramatic action.</p>
        <p>First of all, we must repeat here that by means of the opera libretto (as well as its predecessors in church music, etc.) music conquered a vast new realm, namely, that of dramatic music or the musical drama. In the case of the film, the dialogue does not give access to a new type of work. At best, it enlarges what exists. We have to jemember that in silent film the dialogue, as given in the titles, was not at all the foundation and starting point of the work, from which the pictures were developed. They were a mere expedient added secondarily and for the purpose of explanation to works conceived and realized in images. Perhaps the spoken dialogue may not be able to fulfill even this humble function. What is useful for the opera, may be harmful for the film.</p>
        <p>Will an artist, that is, a person guided by a sure sensitivity for the medium he employs, ever feel impelled to “<span>set</span>” a dialogue “<span>to pictures</span>” instead of creating in pictures? Since pictures are what attract him, he might be tempted by speech as a technical device that would sharpen the meaning of his scenes, save him the tortuous detours necessary to explain the plot, and open up a larger field of subjects. Now, in fact, dialogue makes possible an extensive development of the external action, and particularly also the internal action. No fairly complicated event or state of mind can be conveyed by pictures alone. Therefore, the addition of spoken dialogue has made storytelling easier. In this sense, film dialogue has been defined by some critics as a device for saving time, space, and ingenuity—a saving that would reserve the available limited length of the film and the creative energy of the maker for the truly relevant content of the work. It remains to be seen, however, whether there is, in the movies, any justification for the kind of involved plot that we find in the novel and the play.</p>
        <p>We can easily understand why the large movie audience has applauded the introduction of the spoken word. What the audience wants is to take part in exciting events as fully as possible. The best way of achieving this is, in a certain sense, the mixture of visual action and dialogue: external events are shown concretely to the eye, and at the same time the thoughts, intentions, and emotions of the characters are communicated through words in the directest and most natural way. Moreover the felt presence of the events is enormously enhanced by the sound of voices and other noises. The audience will object only when the dialogue is cut down so much that it does not explain the action or when, on the contrary, there is too little outer action, and all the talking becomes tiresome. In a crude way, these objections to the talking film are the same as those of the connoisseur.</p>
        <p><em>Dialogue narrows the world of the film</em>. —The example of the opera seemed to justify and recommend the use of dialogue. But not without caution can we compare the art of sound and the art of pictures in their relation to the spoken word. One of the main characteristics of dramatic dialogue is that it limits the action to the human performer. This suits music perfectly since, as we said, the opera was created precisely in order to represent human beings in dramatic action musically. The image, of course, does not need dialogue to present man, but in the visual world the human kind does not enjoy the leading role it has on the stage. Granted that in certain paintings human figures hold the foreground gigantically; but just as often painting shows man as a part of his environment, which gives meaning to him and to which he gives meaning. Man appears as a part of the Creation, from which he can be isolated only artificially. The moving picture was from the beginning more concerned with the world animated by man than with man set off against his world. Therefore, to be limited by dialogue to the performances of the human figure was bound to seem intolerable.</p>
        <p>The presentation of man’s natural setting had been one of the achievements that justified the existence of the movies next to the theater. Naturally, the silent film also had often shown the actor in close-ups. But more importantly, it had created a union of silent man and silent things as well as of the (audible) person close-by and the (inaudible) one at a far distance. In the universal silence of the image, the fragments of a broken vase could “<span>talk</span>” exactly the way a character talked to his neighbor, and a person approaching on a road and visible on the horizon as a mere dot “<span>talked</span>” as someone acting in close-up. This homogeneity, which is completely foreign to the theater but familiar to painting, is destroyed by the talking film: it endows the actor with speech, and since only he can have it, all other things are pushed into the background.</p>
        <p>Now there is a limit to the visual expression that can be drawn from the human figure, particularly if the picture has to accompany dialogue. Pure pantomime knows of three ways to overcome this limitation. It can give up the portraying of plots and instead present the “<span>absolute</span>” movement of the body, that is, dance. Here the human body becomes an instrument for melodic and harmonic forms, which are superior to mere pantomime, as music is superior to a (hypothetical) art of natural noises. Secondly, pantomime can adopt the solution of the silent film, namely, become a part of the richer universe in motion. And finally, it can become subservient to dramatic speech— as it does in the theater. But to the pantomime of the talking film all three of these solutions are inaccessible: it cannot become dance because dance does not need speech and perhaps does not even tolerate it; it cannot submerge in the huge <em>orbis pictus</em> of the silent film because of its tie to the human figure; and it cannot become the servant of speech without giving up its own self.</p>
        <p><em>The dialogue paralyzes visual action</em>. —Not only does speech limit the motion picture to an art of dramatic portraiture, it also interferes with the expression of the image. The better the silent film, the more strictly it used to avoid showing people in the act of talking, important though talking is in real life. The actors expressed themselves by posture and facial expression. Additional meaning came from the way the figure was shown within the framework of the picture, by lighting, and particularly by the total context of sequence and plot. The visual counterpart of speech, that is, the monotonous motions of the mouth, yields little and, in fact, can only hamper the expressive movement of the body. The motions of the mouth convincingly demonstrate that the activity of talking compels the actor into visually monotonous, meaningless, and often ludicrous behavior.</p>
        <p>It is obvious that speech cannot be attached to the immobile image (painting, photography); but it is equally ill-suited for the silent film, whose means of expression resemble those of painting. It was precisely the absence of speech that made the silent film develop a style of its own, capable of condensing the dramatic situation. To separate or to find each other, to win or to give in, to be friends or enemies—all such themes were neatly presented by a few simple attitudes, such as a raising of the head or of an arm, or the bowing of one person to another. This had led to a most cine-genic species of tale, which was full of simple happenings and which, with the coming of the talking film, was replaced by a theater-type play, poor in external action but well developed psychologically. This meant replacing the visually fruitful image of man in action with the sterile one of the man who talks.</p>
        <p>As far as the opera is concerned, there is no objection to the dialogue centering the action around the human character; nor is there any to the visual paralysis of the actor. What the opera wants is, we said, the musical expression of man in action. It has little use for the expressive virtues of the animated image on the stage, which remains secondary, complementary, explicatory. The opera director does not hesitate to stop the stage action in favor of long arias. This gives the dialogue plenty of time, and in fact too much time: phrases have to be stretched and repeated to comply with the music. So that what hurts the film does not hurt the opera.</p>
        <p>If after discussing the theoretical difficulties that lie in the way of the talking film we look around to see whether in practice the motion-picture production has worked out satisfactory solutions, we find our diagnosis confirmed. The average talking film today endeavors to combine visually poor scenes full of dialogue with the completely different traditional style of rich, silent action. In comparison with the epoch of the silent film there is also an impressive decline of artistic excellence, in the average films as well as in the peak productions—a trend that cannot be due entirely to the ever increasing industrialization.</p>
        <p>It may seem surprising that mankind should produce in large number works based on a principle that represents such a radical artistic impoverishment if compared with the available purer forms. But is such a contradiction really surprising at a time at which in other respects, too, so many people live a life of unreality and fail to attain the true nature of man and its fitting manifestations? If the opposite happened in the movies, would not such a pleasant inconsistency be even more surprising?</p>
        <p>There is comfort, however, in the fact that hybrid forms are quite unstable. They tend to change from their own unreality into purer forms, even though this may mean a return to the past. Beyond our blundering there are inherent forces that, in the long run, overcome error and incompleteness and direct human action toward the purity of goodness and truth.</p>
