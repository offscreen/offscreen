        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">1933: The Thought That Made the Picture Move</h2>
        <p>Two basic technical properties characterize the film as we know it today: it reproduces the objects of our world photographically, that is, very faithfully, by means of a mechanical process on a two-dimensional surface; and it reproduces motion and events as accurately as it does the shape of things.</p>
        <p>The ancient desire of man to make likenesses of his environment found new satisfaction when he became able to reproduce movement. Whatever the psychological causes of the wish to make likenesses may be, it will sjiffice here to point out that making images of events is even more important than depicting objects in their static shapes and colors because the fundamental biological reaction is that of reacting to happenings not that of contemplating objects. Correspondingly, the arts are greatly concerned from the beginning with things in action: hunting scenes, war, triumphal processions and funerals, dances and feasts.</p>
        <p>Lively though such pictorial descriptions may look to us, they lack the distinguishing feature of events, namely, change in the course of time. Painting and sculpture are static arts: they can seize upon the characteristic theme of an action and record it, but they cannot show its temporal unfolding.</p>
        <p>Visual representation must either reproduce its subject with mechanical accuracy or—in the higher, aesthetic sense of the term—render its essentials faithfully. In addition, representation must fixate the image so that it may be preserved and looked at again at any time. When actors perform a play or when primitive dancers portray the hunter and his game, they create representations that lack the essential property of fixation. From the beginning, man has excelled in making durable but immobile pictures. Up to our own day, he has hardly succeeded in presenting motion by motion in such a way as to obtain a faithful and readily available reproduction. Even film does not meet this specification: it does not render motion by motion but gives an illusion of it by means of immobile images shown in sequence—a procedure that is possible because of the way our eyes work, a magnificent substitute, but something fundamentally different from the rendering of motion by motion.</p>
        <p>Why, then, did we have to resort to illusory movement? Why has the theoretically most obvious solution hardly been employed at all? There is no obstacle in principle—the reasons are mainly technical. Man is capable of making his body carry out movement and he also has put at his service mechanisms that will execute required actions as often as desired and in practically identical fashion. The machines used for manufacture perform the most intricate motions. But little useful machinery has been developed for the mechanical imitation of natural events. Marionettes and shadow figures do render action, but basically they resemble the theater in that they are not controlled mechanically but by the human hand. Granted, there are robots guided by clockworks or electricity. There are wooden figures doffing their hats or pointing at the merchandise in shop windows. Museums exhibit animated models of factories and mines, in which hundreds of small workers and machines are shown in busy action. All such devices fulfill the condition of fixating motion mechanically and of making it reproducible at any time without need of human steering; but nothing better than toys has been made so far, nothing that could be used artistically—various monsters of the horror movies notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>In short, the representations of motion are either controlled by human action, in which case they do not record mechanically, or they are mechanical, but too primitive. In theory, it would be conceivable to produce a satisfactory animated reproduction in two or three dimensions, which showed human figures in natural action, leaves moved by the wind, water purling oyer rocks, clouds drifting across the sky—all this in actual motion, steered by machinery. Perhaps such an animated scene could be produced on a surface by means of iron filings controlled from the back by mechanically steered magnets.</p>
        <p>Theater machinists have no trouble in making clouds move by projecting them on the backdrop. The motion required here is simple and straight, and quite generally the actions reproduced nowadays by such devices are either simple and straight in themselves or are controlled by such uncomplicated motions.</p>
        <p>Photography has raised our demands: we like reproductions not only to be faithful to the object but also to guarantee their faithfulness by being mechanical manifestations of the reproduced object itself. The objects that are photographed impinge their own images mechanically upon the sensitive emulsion. Are there reproductions of movement that satisfy this condition?</p>
        <p>There is indeed the remarkable instance of a physical process that fixates its own motion mechanically in such a way that when the tracing is used later for reproduction, a most faithful performance results, which renders all the natural detail of the original. Significantly enough, this example does not come from the realm of visible things: it is the process of sound recording. All music, voices, and other noises, complex though they may be psychologically, can be reduced physically to a vibratory movement, which does justice to all auditory qualities by means of the amplitude, frequency, and shape of the vibrations. Sound-recording devices make the sound vibrations impress their own path, either mechanically upon wax, shellac, or plastic, or photoelectrically upon film by a beam of light. In the reproduction the tracks that have been obtained in this manner act like rails and thus help produce a movement that is practically identical with the original one. We notice, however, that although the sounds rendered by these techniques are quite complex, the visual shapes used in the process are nothing but one-dimensional lines or very simple otherwise.</p>
        <p>Among the predecessors of cinematography there are some contraptions that made movement reproduce movement, although in a primitive fashion. This was done either by moving the pictures themselves or by moving their projected image optically, or, finally, by projecting upon a mobile medium. The Laterna Magica that was constructed in the seventeenth century by the mathematician Milliet de Chales used glass slides introduced from the side. This technique not only suggested putting a sequence of several pictures on the same slide and showing them in succession but also having one scene glide through the visual field in a continuous motion, thus imitating the impression one gets when looking through the window of a car. The same principle operated in the so-called <em>Vues Optiques</em>, with which the Savoyard boys traveled. Through an enlarging eyepiece the public watched painted or printed scenes, which were commonly wound on reels and pulled through the box laterally by means of a crank. It is worth noticing that the movement reproduced here by real movement is an illusory one, namely, the subjective experience of seeing the world slide by the window. In physical reality, such a primitively simple displacement of the entire setting does not occur.</p>
        <p>The displacement of the entire picture, crude though it is, helps considerably to animate the performance, particularly since the mechanism that produces the motion is hidden from sight. A useful demonstration of how much the choice of subject matter and the way of presenting it depend on the nature of the recording instrument is evidenced in that later, when the actual motion-picture camera was in use, traveling shots of landscapes were not at all obvious but had to be invented all over again, as it were, although the practically identical effect had been known for centuries. Mr. M. A. Promio who toured Europe in 1896 with the new Lumiere apparatus, as a camera reporter and projectionist combined in one person, writes: “<span>In Italy, it occurred to me for the first time to make traveling shots. After arriving in Venice I took the boat from the station to my hotel. When I saw the buildings along the Canale Grande move by, I had the idea that the film camera, which could take pictures of moving things while it was standing still, perhaps could take immobile things while it was moving itself. I took a sample film and sent it to Mr. Louis Lumiere, asking him for his opinion. The reaction was positive</span>”. Mr. Promio’s idea has all the virtues of a genuine invention even though what he found was not new historically. The old effect, namely, the moving landscape, is arrived at from an entirely new starting point, and in the process the principle of relativity, on which the effect is based, is formulated explicitly: in motion pictures, movement is not absolute but always related to the station point of the camera. Here, then, a pioneer considered the properties of the recording technique in a way that later on led to the development of film as art. To conceive of the idea that the camera was not simply a passive receiver of what was moving around in front of the lens, but could take an active part, for instance, by moving itself, was a first step in the direction of progress. It was much less obvious to make the camera move than to move pictures through the peep-show box.</p>
        <p>In the <em>Vues Optiques</em> the image moved as a whole. Therefore, it was not possible with this technique to make a human figure move in front of an immobile background. But by leaving out all background one could present a moving figure without giving away the fact that actually the whole field was moving. Some such device may also have played a part in certain conjuring shows, in which projected figures were made to appear getting larger or smaller by moving the Laterna Magica backward or forward. There are reports from antiquity to suggest that even then such tricks were known, including the use of lenses and concave mirrors. Damasius, as cited by Coissac, describes how a “<span>mass of light</span>” appeared on the wall of a temple in Alexandria. At first, it seemed to be very far away, and as it approached it changed into what was taken to be the supernatural apparition of a figure. Probably this exciting effect was produced by beginning the projection out of focus and gradually moving the lens until the picture of the figure could be seen sharply. A more elaborate system was used by the magician E. G. Robertson, who at the time of the French Revolution made the effigies of the dead appear to a puzzled audience. He compensated the movement of the lantern by changing the position of the lens and thereby was able to show a figure growing larger and remaining in sharp focus throughout the change. In this manner he obtained the compelling impression of an approaching figure— an effect that is brought about more comfortably nowadays by lenses of variable magnification (so-called zoom lenses). It is not unlikely that sometimes Robertson projected on smoke, which produced distorted, moving images. This trick, too, seems to have a long history—compare, for instance, Benvenuto Cellini’s description of the apparition of ghosts in the Colosseum. What all these procedures have in common is that the movement is not derived from the reproduced objects themselves but is imposed upon the picture from the outside. The effects thus attainable, namely, lateral displacement, or change of total size, or irregular distortion will not produce characteristic likeness unless by accident or in a rather primitive fashion.</p>
        <p>Since attempts to represent movement by movement had not been very successful, illusory movement attracted the attention of inventors. They found that they could create the impression of movement by combining still pictures with each other. A curious theoretical question arises here: is there not an inherent contradiction in trying to fixate changing things? How can we record a given phase of a movement at the same place at which a moment before we recorded the preceding phase, permanently—since it is permanent recording we are after?</p>
        <p>At this point it is necessary to introduce a distinction between two different tasks accomplished by film: it presents a picture of motion, such as that of a runner, or a dancer, or a mower, and it also renders the successive phases of events. In principle there is no sharp division between the two functions since they both derive from the capacity to record changes that occur within the dimension of time. Yet in practice the difference is evident and quite important, so much so that in the visual arts the two kinds of activity are represented in totally different ways.</p>
        <p>Momentary motion has always been represented in the arts by showing the limbs of the human body in active positions: running legs, fighting arms, gestures of grief, dance positions. The course of an action in time, on the other hand, could never be presented by a single image—it always had to be a series. It suffices to think of the stations of the cross, or the stories of the lives of the saints. Temporal sequence is translated into spatial sequence, the continuum of the story is divided up into phases, and the same figure returns in several representations, be it in several pictures or vyithin the frame of one, thus splitting its identity.</p>
        <p>This distribution of successive phases over a series of pictures and the related splitting of identity—that is, the technique used in painting and sculpture only for the purpose of representing the stages of a story— turned out to be the best way for the film to portray live, momentary motion. There was a profound difference, of course: in film, the single pictures of the sequence exist only technically, not in what is experi-enced by the audience. As far as the eyes of the spectators go, there is no synthesis of phases but an indivisible continuum. The principle of synthesis reappears in the movies only when scenes that were taken separately ^re spliced together in montage in such a way that discontinuities of time and space are suggested.</p>
        <p>It sounds paradoxical, I said before, to want to fixate the mobile by means of the immobile. Which solutions of this problem are there available in principle?</p>
        <p>1) If we make a photographic time exposure of a person who is standing in front of the camera and, without moving from his place, changes the expression of his face, the result will be a blurred picture because the successive phases of the facial expression will have been recorded one on top of the other. That is, one cannot simply ignore the time dimension—some equivalent has to be found for it. The recording of periodic events represents a borderline case: the photograph of an oscillating pendulum, for instance, will produce at least sharp images of the extreme positions on each side. This opportunity was used in 1865 by Onimus and Martin, who photographed the movement of the living heart in vivisectional experiments. (These attempts represent the beginnings of the so-called chronophotography, whose main pioneer was the physiologist Etienne Jules Marey.) Since the motion of the heart comes to a kind of standstill and turns direction at the moments of the greatest expansion and contraction, the two limiting phases were clearly recorded on the photographic plate. Notice that the procedure is applicable only when, strictly speaking, motion has come to a standstill, and also when the phases to be recorded happen to fall upon different places on the photographic plate. The special character of periodic movement is made particularly evident by the fact that it can give the impression of complete rest. This happens when of each period of movement only one, and always the same, momentary phase is singled out for observation. In order to control the regularity of the rotation in machines, the strobo-scope is used. If the apertures of the stroboscope are exposed exactly at the rate of the rotation, the same phase of the motion is seen every time, and the machine seems to stand still. Here, then, a succession of exposures at the same place produces a sharp and clear image because the phases thus superimposed upon one another are identical. 2) When the object to be photographed changes its location on the plate while it is moving, the phases that follow each other in time can be presented next to each other in space. If, for example, the object moves across the field, the path of the movement will be faithfully recorded. The finest illustration of this principle is a time exposure of the starry sky. Every star appears as a bright circular line. The procedure is applicable because the objects to be photographed are nothing but light dots and the background is plain black. There are no shapes to get blurred by their displacement on the plate.</p>
        <p>According to Marey, however, chronophotography has two tasks: it must record the path of the movement and also the positions of the object in various stages. The second task obviously cannot be solved with the present procedure since the various phases overlap in such a way that their images cancel each other out.</p>
        <p>3) The next requirement, then, is that of breaking up the continuum into separate sharp images. The recording ofithe movement has to be interrupted periodically, and the resulting exposures must be short enough to yield sharp pictures. Naturally, this presupposes a sufficiently sensitive photographic emulsion or a sufficiently strong light source. The modern highspeed methods have reduced the exposure time to less than one ten-thousandth of a second. Daguerre had to leave his lens open for several minutes in order to take a picture, but even Eadweard Muybridge in the 1870’s took snapshots at one six-thousandth of a second, and the emulsions he used would have permitted him to use even shorter exposures if his cameras had permitted him to do so.</p>
        <p>Obviously, the faster the object moves, the shorter the exposure time has to be in order to give sharp pictures. Also, the faster the movement, the shorter the time interval between subsequent pictures must be (other factors being equal) if all essential phases of the action are to be recorded. For example, Marey’s “<span>photographic rifle</span>”, which took twelve pictures per second was not fast enough to record the phases of the flight of birds.</p>
        <p>By what means was the exposure interrupted? Da-guerre could take the lid off the lens and hold it in his hand until time was up. Ottomar Anschutz used for his serial photographs the kind of shutter that is found in every photocamera today and that had been invented by Jules Janssen in 1874. This mechanism, however, is impractical when the camera is expected to take several pictures in quick succession. For this reason, Janssen constructed a rotating shutter disk, which made it possible for his “<span>photographic pistol</span>” to take forty-eight pictures in a row. The rotating disk was perforated by slots, which let the light pass and thereby exposed the emulsion briefly at the desired intervals. A similar effect can be obtained by interrupting the light source periodically. This is one of the methods used in scientific high-speed photography today; but already in 1887 Anschutz mounted series of slides on the rotating disk of his “<span>electrotachyscope</span>” and lighted them for the purpose of projection by intermittently flashing vacuum tubes.</p>
        <p>The periodic interruption of the exposure definitely reduces the recording of movement to the taking of static pictures. If the exposure time is short enough, the motion of the object approaches zero, and the picture will be sharp. The action to be recorded is now composed of separate phases; nevertheless, it is more fitting historically to speak of analysis rather than of synthesis because the originally unitary movement has been decomposed into partial images.</p>
        <p>In Marey’s chronophotography the fixation of sequences on the immobile negative was used for purely scientific research in physiology. Motion was to be analyzed, not reproduced in projection. Even sov chronophotography represents an important prepara tory stage in the development toward the motion picture, which involves the decomposition of the action as a first step.</p>
        <p>Marey’s technique could be applied only to objects that moved parallel to the picture plane—a condition he was able to fulfill in his experiments. Also since he opened the entire negative to the light every time, he had to sefe to it that it was not spoiled by premature exposure. Suppose a person running in front of a landscape were photographed in this fashion; every time the negative would be exposed in order to record a new phase of the running, the entire landscape would also register, that is, the plate would no longer be sensitive to the picture of the man. Marey was compelled, therefore, to take his pictures against a black background—another considerable limitation, as far as any more general use of the technique was concerned. And finally, of course, the movement had to take place within the immobile range of the camera. If the recorded movement was to cover a reasonably large span, it had to be photographed from a fairly great distance—which means that the pictures thus obtained were necessarily small. Also, the orientation of the object toward the camera changed during the displacement, that is, the perspective appearance of the object did not remain constant.</p>
        <p>4) One step further, and a different piece of negative is reserved for each picture. The plate is still immobile so that there are only two possible solutions: either the lens moves in front of the plate, or a whole sequence of cameras is used to take one picture each. No historical example of the first procedure seems to be known; the second is used in the serial photographs of Muybridge (1877) and Anschiitz (1885).</p>
        <p>When a group of cameras photograph the moving object in succession, a set of phases is recorded. But since several cameras cannot be set up in the same place, the station point keeps changing. If they are arranged in a row, the result will look in the projection like a traveling shot—an effect that is welcome occasionally, for instance, when the object moves along the row of cameras. Under other conditions, the resulting parallax might produce a vexing problem, however, as shown, for instance, by the apparatus of Augustin le Prince. He mounted a number of lenses in two circular arrangements, which alternately photographed the objects on two different strips of film. When Joseph Mason undertook to demonstrate the efficiency of this arrangement experimentally by projecting the pictures, he had to take figures on a black background, cut the film strip into single pictures, and correct the displacements in such a way that the figures taken from two different visual angles appeared nevertheless in the same spot of the visual field. Parallactic displacement is particularly disturbing when several pictures that are taken at the same time of the same object, must be combined as is done in certain color film systems. This produces a spatial parallax, whereas a temporal parallax—equally undesirable—results when the pictures of the moving object are taken from the same place, but one after the other. Stereoscopic film, on the other hand, makes use of the parallax by combining in the mind of the observer two pictures taken from slightly different viewpoints; it thus obtains the same kind of three-dimensional effect as do a person’s two eyes.</p>
        <p>In the serial photographs of Muybridge and An-schiitz, then, the relationship between camera and moving object was kept constant by using a different camera for recording each phase along the path. Race horses, goats, or ostriches released with their running feet each camera at the exact moment when they passed through the field of its lens. By this method the releasing mechanism was made dependent on the-movement of the object. In consequence, the pictures were taken at constant intervals only when the object happened to move at constant speed. But at least it was possible now to record a series of phases on a series of negatives, which were exposed individually. The mutual independence of the single pictures had been accomplished definitely and thoroughly.</p>
        <p>5) None of the methods so far described was “<span>film</span>” as we know it today. The history of human ingenuity shows that almost every innovation goes through a preliminary phase in which the solution is obtained by the old method, modified or amplified by some new feature. Just as the first motorcars looked like horse-drawn carriages but had motors built in, so the first photographic recordings of motion were based on the traditional still camera: they were done either with one camera on one negative or by a combination of several cameras.</p>
        <p>The decisive invention consisted in making available a new piece of negative for each new phase of the moving object. Up to that point the negative had remained immobile, and therefore it had been up to the object to cooperate by moving in such a way that each phase photographed on a different area of the plate. As soon as the negative is made to move, the object may remain in one and the same place, and a series of pictures may still be taken from the same spot.</p>
        <p>In some of the early apparatuses several pieces of negative were mounted on a mobile carrier. Marey’s photographic rifle contained a small rotating glass disk on the margin of which twelve pieces of negative were mounted. In others, one large negative was exposed a sufficient number of times while it rotated in the camera. Thus in Janssen’s photographic pistol, by means of which the inventor photographed the phases of the transit of the planet Venus in front of the sun on December 9, 1874, forty-eight pictures were made on the margin of the negative. The method of using one negative is somewhat more convenient as far as developing and printing are concerned, and therefore it has prevailed. Today’s film technique uses one negative, the film strip, which is exposed portion by portion.</p>
        <p>In the first cameras the pictures were arranged in circles. Presumably this was the most efficient method available for inflexible negative plates. The discovery of celluloid is historically later than the first attempts to photograph motion by means of mobile negatives; hence the rotating negative plates.</p>
        <p>A combination of rotation and linear displacement is attributed to Edison. He is said to have arranged negatives in a spiral on a cylinder—an idea obviously influenced by the principle of his phonograph cylinders. The spiral uses space more economically than the circle on the disk, but the flexible celluloid base won out over both. The use of a spiral arrangement on a disloby W. Friese-Greene in 1885 should be mentioned, nevertheless, as well as an experiment in which rows of six pictures each were photographed in a zigzag scanning motion on one plate. This latter principle, remindful of the modern television technique, has found no further application in the motion-picture field so far, although the cameraman Guido Seeber has pointed out that it might regain interest if microscopically small negatives could be made. Some other principles, known from the history of the projection technique, seem never to have been tried for the taking of pictures: there is the arrangement on the outside of a drum or on the spokes of a paddle wheel or the booklet type used in Linnett’s kineograph of 1868 or Casler’s mutoscope of 1894.</p>
        <p>With the adoption of the flexible base, the last resemblance to the old photographic glass plate became a thing of the past. The first material to be used was not celluloid. Friese-Greene tried oiled paper, and Eastman also experimented with paper before the first paperless film was put on the market as roll film in 1889. Among the first customers were the Edison Photographic Works in Orange.</p>
        <p>The movement of the base is not sufficient to solve the fundamental problem since a blurred picture results when the object is recorded on a continuously moving plate or film. The motion of the object itself is an additional source of blur. The theoretically simplest solution is that of making the exposure time for each image so short that the movement of the negative as well as that of the object will be reduced practically to zero. But with so short an exposure time even the strongest light will produce fairly dark pictures. Therefore this technique has been used only for the kind of slow-motion shots that require 250 pictures or more per second and for which the normal modern procedure of intermittent movement would be too hard on the camera and the film. The scientific purposes of such high-speed photography are often satisfied by shadowlike outline pictures of the moving object.</p>
        <p>When, however, normal, well-lighted pictures are desired, the negative material of the kind that is available today requires longer exposures. A rather intricate solution is offered by what is known as optical compensation. The movement of the negative carrier remains continuous, but an optical system of rotating glass slabs makes the image of the lens accompany the moving negative long enough to increase the exposure time somewhat. This means that an additional movement is introduced for the purpose of compensating the relative displacement of negative versus lens. This principle also is used only for high-speed work.</p>
        <p>The method commonly applied nowadays abandons the continuous motion of the base: the negative is arrested during each exposure. This means that the motion picture, after having emancipated itself from still photography by introducing the principle of the mobile base, returns to snapshot photography, although at a higher technical level: the photograph is made again on an immobile negative, but after each exposure the negative is replaced by means of an efficient mechanism. The translation of the continuous movement into intermittent movement is achieved either by a so-called claw, which engages the sprocket holes of the film and pulls the negative down, frame by frame, or by a Maltese cross, which moves the film by intermittent rotation. A shutter serves to withhold the light while the negative moves. The Maltese cross was used already around the middle of the nineteenth century by Molteni, who projected animated cartoons from an intermittently rotating disk. Janssen used the same device for his photographic pistol, whereas a claw mechanism served—for shooting, printing, and projecting alike—in Lumiere’s famous <em>Cinematographe</em>. Nowadays the Maltese cross is used mostly in projectors, the claw for cameras.</p>
        <p>Finally, a word should be said about the source of energy that produces the motion. Janssen and Marey moved their rotating disks by clockworks, which are forerunners of our modern electric and spring motors. The early film cameras were, of course, operated by crank, but even then the activating movement was continuous. Only in animation work each frame is exposed by a separate move. This technical feature may help to illustrate the fact that the motion picture is not a synthetic agglomeration of individual images but based on a recording process that is as continuous and unitary as the movement of the photographed objects. The dividing of the movement into single “<span>frames</span>” (just as their subsequent unification in the projection) is nothing but a technical detail, which does not concern the nature of the procedure. There is, then, a difference in principle between the recording of visual motion and the immobile images of photography, painting, or sculpture. Film is more than a variation of the immobile image, obtained by multiplication: it is fundamentally new and different.</p>
