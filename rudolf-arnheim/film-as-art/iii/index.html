        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em class="notranslate" translate="no">1 Film and Reality</em></h2>
        <p>Film resembles painting, music, literature, and the dance in this respect—it is a medium that may, but need not, be used to produce artistic results. Colored picture post cards, for instance, are not art and are not intended to be. Neither are a military march, a true confessions story, or a strip tease. And the movies are not necessarily film art.</p>
        <p>There are still many educated people who stoutly deny the possibility that film might be art. They say, in effect: “<span>Film cannot be art, for it does nothing but reproduce reality mechanically</span>”. Those who defend this point of view are reasoning from the analogy of painting. In painting, the way from reality to the picture lies via the artist's eye and nervous system, his hand and, finally, the brush that puts strokes on canvas. The process is not mechanical as that of photography, in which the light rays reflected from the object are collected by a system of lenses and are then directed onto a sensitive plate where they produce chemical changes. Does this state of affairs justify our denying photography and film a place in the temple of the Muses?</p>
        <p>It is worth while to refute thoroughly and systematically the charge that photography and film are only mechanical reproductions and that they therefore have no connection with art—for this is an excellent method of getting to understand the nature of film art.</p>
        <p>With this end in view, the basic elements of the film medium will be examined separately and compared with the corresponding characteristics of what we perceive “<span>in reality</span>”. It will be seen how fundamentally different the two kinds of image are; and that it is just these differences that provide film with its artistic resources. We shall thus come at the same time to understand the working principles of film art.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Projection of Solids Upon a Plane Surface</h3>
        <p>Let us consider the visual reality of some definite object such as a cube. If this cube is standing on a table in front of me, its position determines whether I can realize its shape properly. If I see, for example, merely the four sides of a square, I have no means of knowing that a cube is before me, I see only a square surface. The human eye, and equally the photographic lens, acts from a particular position and from there can take in only such portions of the field of vision as are not hidden by things in front. As the cube is now-placed, five of its faces are screened by the sixth, and therefore this last only is visible. But since this face might equally well conceal something quite different—since it might be the base of a pyramid or one side of a sheet of paper, for instance—our view of the cube has not been selected characteristically.</p>
        <p>We have, therefore, already established one important principle: If I wish to photograph a cube, it is not enough for me to bring the object within range of my camera. It is rather a question of my position relative to the object, or of where I place it. The aspect chosen above gives very little information as to the shape of the cube. One, however, that reveals three surfaces of the cube and their relation to one another, shows enough to make it fairly unmistakable what the object <em>is</em> supposed to be. Since our field of vision is full of solid objects, but our eye (like the camera) sees this field from only one station point at any given moment, and since the eye can perceive the rays of light that are reflected from the object only by projecting them onto a plane surface—the retina—the reproduction of even a perfectly simple object is not a mechanical process but can be set about well or badly.</p>
        <p>The second aspect gives a much truer picture of the cube than the first. The reason for this is that the second shows more than the first—three faces instead of only one. As a rule, however, truth does not depend on quantity. If it were merely a matter of finding which aspect shows the greatest amount of surface, the best point of view could be arrived at by purely mechanical calculation. There is no formula to help one choose the most characteristic aspect: it is a question of feeling. Whether a particular person is “<span>more himself</span>” in profile than full face, whether the palm or the outside of the hand is more expressive, whether a particular mountain is better taken from the north or the west cannot be ascertained mathematically—they are matters of delicate sensibility.</p>
        <p>Thus, as a preliminary, people who contemptuously refer to the camera as an automatic recording machine must be made to realize that even in the simplest photographic reproduction of a perfectly simple object, a feeling for its nature is required which is quite beyond any mechanical operation. We shall see later, by the way, that in artistic photography and film, those aspects that best show the characteristics of a particular object are not by any means always chosen; others are often selected deliberately for the sake of achieving specific effects.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Reduction of Depth</h3>
        <p>How do our eyes succeed in giving us three-dimensional impressions even though the flat retinae can receive only two-dimensional images? Depth perception relies mainly on the distance between the two eyes, which makes for two slightly different images. The fusion of these two pictures into one image gives the three-dimensional impression. As is well known, the same principle is used in the stereoscope, for which two photographs are taken at once, about the same distance apart as the human eyes. This process cannot be used for film without recourse to awkward devices, such as colored spectacles, when more than one person is to watch the projection. For a single spectator it would be easy to make a stereoscopic film. It would only mean taking two simultaneous shots of the same incident a couple of inches apart and then showing one of them to each eye. For display to a larger number of spectators, however, the problem of stereoscopic film has not yet been solved satisfactorily—and hence the sense of depth in film pictures is extraordinarily small. The movement of people or objects from front to back makes a certain depth evident—but it is only necessary to glance into a stereoscope, which makes everything stand out most realistically, to recognize how flat the film picture <em>is</em>. This is another example of the fundamental difference between visual reality and film.</p>
        <p>The effect of film is neither absolutely two-dimensional nor absolutely three-dimensional, but something between. Film pictures are at once plane and solid. In Ruttmanns film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Berlin</em> there is a scene of two subway trains passing each other in opposite directions. The shot is taken looking down from above onto the two trains. Anyone watching this scene realizes, first of all, that one train is coming toward him and the other going away frdm him (three-dimensional image). He will then also see that one is moving from the lower margin of the screen toward the upper and the other from the upper toward the lower (plane image). This second impression results from the projection of the three-dimensional movement onto the screen surface, which, of course, gives different directions of motion.</p>
        <p>The obliteration of the three-dimensional impression has as a second result a stronger accentuation of perspective overlapping. In real life or in a stereoscope, overlapping is accepted as due merely to the accidental arrangement of objects, but very marked cuts result from superimpositions in a plane image. If a man is holding up a newspaper so that one corner comes across his face, this corner seems almost to have been cut out of his face, so sharp are the edges. Moreover, when the three-dimensional impression is lost, other phenomena, known to psychologists as the constancies of size and shape, disappear. Physically, the image thrown onto the retina of the eye by any object in the field of vision diminishes in proportion to the square of the distance. If an object a yard distant is moved away another yard, the area of the image on the retina is diminished to one-quarter of that of the first image. Every photographic plate reacts similarly. Hence in a photograph of someone sitting with his feet stretched out far in front of him the subject comes out with enormous feet and much too small a head. Curiously enough, however, we do not in real life get impressions to accord with the images on the retina. If a man is standing three feet away and another equally tall six feet away, the area of the image of the second does not appear to be only a quarter of that of the first. Nor if a man stretches out his hand toward one does it look disproportionately large. One sees the two men as equal in size and the hand as normal. This phenomenon is known as the constancy of size. It is impossible for most people—excepting those accustomed to drawing and painting, that is, artificially trained—to see according to the image on the retina. This fact, incidentally, is one of the reasons the average person has trouble copying things “<span>correctly</span>” Now an essential for the functioning of the constancy of size is a clear three-dimensional impression; it works excellently in a stereoscope with an ordinary photograph, but hardly at all in a film picture. Thus, in a film picture, if one man <em>is</em> twice as far from the camera as another, the one in front looks very considerably the taller and broader.</p>
        <p>It is the same with the constancy of shape. The retinal image of a table top is like the photograph of it; the front edge, being nearer to the spectator, appears much wider than the back; the rectangular surface becomes a trapezoid in the image. As far as the average person is concerned, however, this again does not hold good in practice: he <em>sees</em> the surface as rectangular and draws it that way too. Thus the perspective changes taking place in any object that extends in depth are not observed but are compensated unconsciously. That is what is meant by the constancy of form. In a film picture it is hardly operative at all—a table top, especially if it is near the camera, looks very wide in front and very narrow at the back.</p>
        <p>These phenomena, as a matter of fact, are due not only to the reduction of three-dimensionality but also to the unreality of the film picture altogether —an unreality due just as much to the absence of color, the delimitation of the screen, and so forth. The result of all this is that sizes and shapes do not appear on the screen in their true proportions but distorted in perspective.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Lighting and the Absence of Color</h3>
        <p>It is particularly remarkable that the absence of colors, which one would suppose to be a fundamental divergence from nature, should have been noticed so little before the color film called attention to it. The reduction of all colors to black and white, which does not leave even their brightness values untouched (the reds, for instance, may come too dark or too light, depending on the emulsion), very considerably modifies the picture of the actual world. Yet everyone who goes to see a film accepts the screen world as being true to nature. This is due to the phenomenon of “<span>partial illusion</span>” (see p. 24). The spectator experiences no shock at finding a world in which the sky <em>is</em> the same color as a human face; he accepts shades of gray as the red, white, and blue of the flag; black lips as red; white hair as blond. The leaves on a tree are as dark as a woman's mouth. In other words, not only has a multicolored world been transmuted into a black-and-white world, but in the process all color values have changed their relations to one another: similarities present themselves which do not exist in the natural world; things have the same color which in reality stand either in no direct color connection at all with each other or in quite a different one.</p>
        <p>The film picture resembles reality insofar as lighting plays a very important role. Lighting, for instance, helps greatly in making the shape of an object clearly recognizable. (The craters on the surface of the moon are practically invisible at full moon because the sun is perpendicular and no shadows are thrown, The sunlight must come from one side for the outlines of the mountains and the valleys to become visible.) Moreover, the background must be of a brightness value that allows the object to stand out from it sufficiently; it must not be patterned by the light in such a way that it prevents a clear survey of the object by making it appear as though certain portions of the background were part of the object or vice versa.</p>
        <p>These rules apply, for example, to the difficult art of photographing works of sculpture. Even when nothing but a “<span>mechanical</span>” reproduction is required, difficulties arise which often puzzle both the sculptor and the photographer. From which side is the statue to be taken? From what distance? Shall it be lighted from the front, from behind, from the right or left side? How these problems are solved determines whether the photograph or film shot turns out anything like the real object or whether it looks like something totally different.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Delimitation of the Image and Distance From the Object</h3>
        <p>Our visual field is limited. Sight is strongest at the center of the retina, clearness of vision decreases toward the edges, and, finally, there is a definite boundary to the range of vision due to the structure of the organ. Thus, if the eyes are fixed upon a particular point, we survey a limited expanse. This fact is, however, of little practical importance. Most people are quite unconscious of it, for the reason that our eyes and heads are mobile and we continually exercise this power, so that the limitation of our range of vision never obtrudes itself. For this reason, if for no other, it is utterly false for certain theorists, and some practitioners, of the motion picture to assert that the circumscribed picture on the screen is an image of our circumscribed view in real life. That is poor psychology. The limitations of a film picture and the limitations of sight cannot be compared because in the actual range of human vision the limitation simply does not exist The field of vision is in practice unlimited and infinite. A whole room may be taken as a continuous field of vision, although our eyes cannot survey this room from a single position, for while we are looking at anything our gaze is not fixed but moving. Because our head and <em>eyes</em> move we visualize the entire room as an unbroken whole.</p>
        <p>It is otherwise with the film or photograph. For the purpose of this argument we are considering a single shot taken with a fixed camera. We shall discuss traveling and panorama shots later. (Even these aids in no sense replace the natural range of vision nor are they intended to do so.) The limitations of the picture are felt immediately. The pictured space is visible to a certain extent, but then comes the edge which cuts off what lies beyond. It is a mistake to deplore this restriction as a drawback. I shall show later that on the contrary it is just such restrictions which give film its right to be called an art.</p>
        <p>This restriction (though also the lack of any sense of the force of gravity, see p. 32) explains why it is often very difficult to reproduce intelligibly in a photograph the spatial orientation of the scene depicted. If, for example, the slope of a mountain is photographed from below, or a flight of steps from above, the finished picture surprisingly will often give no impression of height or depth. To represent an ascent or descent by purely visual means is difficult unless the level ground can somehow be shown as a frame of reference. Similarly there must be standards of comparison to show the size of anything. To show the height of trees or of a building, for instance, human figures may be introduced beside them. A man in real life looks all round him when he <em>is</em> walking; and even supposing he is going up a mountain path with his <em>eyes</em> fixed on the ground at his feet, he still has a sense of the general lie of the surrounding country in his mind. This perception comes to him chiefly because his muscles and his sense of balance tell him at every instant exactly in what relation his body stands to the horizontal. Hence he can continually assess correctly the visual impression of the slanting surface. In contrast to such a man is one who is looking at a photograph or screen picture. He must depend upon what his eyes tell him without any assistance from the rest of his body. Moreover, he has only that part of the visual situation which is included within the confines of the picture to help him get his bearings.</p>
        <p>The range of the picture is related to the distance of the camera from the object. The smaller the section of real life to be brought into the picture, the nearer the camera must be to the object, and the larger the object in question comes out in the picture—and vice versa. If a whole group of people is to be photographed, the camera must be placed several yards away. If only a single hand is to be shown, the camera must be very close, otherwise other objects besides the hand will appear in the picture. By this means the hand comes out enormously large and extends over the whole screen. Thus the camera, like a man who can move freely, is able to look at an object from close to or from a distance—a self-evident truth that must be mentioned inasmuch as from it is derived an important artistic device. (Variations of range and size can also be obtained by lenses of different focal lengths. The effects are similar but involve no change of the distance from the object and, therefore, no change of perspective.)</p>
        <p>How large an object appears on the screen depends partly on the distance at which the camera was placed from it, but partly also on how much the picture is enlarged when the finished film is projected. The degree of enlargement depends on the lens of the projection machine and on the size of the theater. A film may be shown in whatever size is preferred—as small as the pictures in a child's magic lantern or gigantic as in a movie palace. There is, however, an optimum relationship between the size of the picture and its distance from the spectators. In a motion-picture theater the spectator sits relatively far away from the screen. Hence the projection must be large. But those watching pictures in a living room are quite close to the screen and therefore the projection may be much smaller. Nevertheless, the range of sizes used in practice is wider than is altogether desirable. In large theaters the projection is larger than in small ones. The spectators in the front rows naturally see a much larger picture than those in the back rows. It is, however, by no means a matter of indifference how large the picture appears to the spectator. The photography is designed for projection of a particular relative size. Thus in a large projection, or when the spectator is near the picture,- movements appear more rapid than in a small one, since in the former case a larger area has to be covered than in the latter. A movement which seems hurried and confused in a large picture may be perfectly right and normal in a smaller one. The relative size of the projection, moreover, determines how clearly the details in the picture are visible to the spectator; and there is obviously a great difference between seeing a man so clearly that one can count the dots on his tie, and being able to recognize him only vaguely—more especially since, as has been pointed out, the size in which the object <em>is</em> to appear is used by the film director to obtain a definite artistic effect. Thus by the spectator's sitting too near or too far away a most disagreeable and obvious misrepresentation of what the artist intended may arise. Up to the present it is impossible to show a film to a large audience so that each member of it sees tl e picture in its right dimensions. After all, spectators must, as far as possible, be placed one behind the other; because when the rows of seats extend too far sideways, those sitting at the ends will see the picture distorted—and that <em>is</em> even worse.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Absence of the Space-Time Continuum</h3>
        <p>In real life every experience or chain of experiences is enacted for every observer in an uninterrupted spatial and temporal sequence. I may, for example, see two people talking together in a room. I am standing fifteen feet away from them. I can alter the distance between us; but this alteration is not made abruptly. I cannot suddenly be only five feet away; I must move through the intervening space. I can leave the room; but I cannot suddenly be in the street. In order to reach the street I must go out of the room, through the door, down the stairs. And similarly with time. I cannot suddenly see what these two people will be doing ten minutes later. These ten minutes must first pass in their entirety. There are no jerks in time or space in real life. Time and space are continuous.</p>
        <p>Not so in film. The period of time that is being photographed may be interrupted at any point. One scene may be immediately followed by another that takes place at a totally different time. And the continuity of space may be broken in the same manner. A moment ago I may have been standing a hundred yards away from a house. Suddenly I am close in front of it. I may have been in Sydney a few moments ago. Immediately afterward I can be in Boston. I have only to join the two strips together. To be sure, in practice this freedom is usually restricted in that the subject of the film is an account of some action, and a certain logical unity of time and space must be observed into which the various scenes are fitted. For time especially there are definite rules which must be obeyed.</p>
        <p>Within any one film sequence, scenes follow each other in their order of time—unless some digression is introduced as, for example, in recounting earlier adventures, dreams, or memories. Within such a flashback, again, time passes naturally, but the action occurs outside the framework of the main story and need not even stand in any precise time relationship (“<span>before</span>” or “<span>after</span>”) to it. Within individual scenes the succession of separate events implies a corresponding sequence of time. If, for example, a “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">long shot</span>” of a man raising a revolver and firing it is shown, the raising and firing cannot be shown again afterward as a close-up. To do so would be to make a sequence of events that were in fact simultaneous.</p>
        <p>That things are happening simultaneously is of course most simply indicated by showing the events in one and the same picture. If I see someone writing at a table in the foreground and someone else in the back playing the piano, the situation is self-explanatory as far as time <em>is</em> concerned. This method <em>is</em> nevertheless, often avoided for artistic reasons and the situation composed of separate shots.</p>
        <p>If two sequences of the action are to be understood as occurring at the same time they may simply be shown one after the other, in which case, however, it must be obvious from the content that simultaneity is intended. The most primitive way of giving this information in a silent film <em>is</em> by printed titles. (“<span>While Elise was hovering between life and death, Edward was boarding the liner at San Francisco</span>”) Or something of this sort: A horse race has been announced to begin at 3:40. The scene is a room full of people who are interested in the race. Someone pulls out a watch and shows the hands pointing to 3:40. Next scene—the racecourse with the horses starting. Events occurring simultaneously may also be shown by cutting up the various scenes and alternating the sections so that the progress of the different events is shown by turns.</p>
        <p>Within the individual scenes the time continuum must never be disturbed. Not only must things that occur simultaneously not be shown one after the other, but no time must be omitted. If a man is going from the door to the window, the action must be shown in its entirety; the middle part, for example, must not be suppressed and the spectator left to see the man starting from the door and then with a jerk arriving at the window. This gives the feeling of a violent break in the action, unless something else is inserted so that the intervening time is otherwise occupied. Time may be dropped in the course of a scene only to produce a deliberately comic effect—as, for instance, when Charlie Chaplin enters a pawnbroker's shop and emerges instantly without his overcoat. Since to show complete incidents would frequently be dull and inartistic, because superfluous, the course of the action is sometimes interrupted by parts of scenes taking place simultaneously somewhere else. In this way it can be arranged to show only those moments of each event which are necessary for the action without patching together things that are incoherent in time. Apart from this, each scene in a good film must be so well planned in the scenario that everything necessary, and only what is necessary, takes place within the shortest space of time.</p>
        <p>Although the time continuum within any individual scene must remain uninterrupted, the time relationship between scenes that occur at different places is undefined in principle so that it may be impossible to tell whether the second scene takes place before, during, or after the first. This is very clearly shown in many educational films where there is no connection in time but only in subject. As, for example: “<span>. . . not only rabbits but also Hons may be tamed</span>”. First picture— performing rabbits. Within this scene the continuity of time must be observed. Second picture—lion taming. Here too the continuity of time must not be broken. These two scenes, however, have no sort of time connection. The lion taming may go on before, during, or after the performance with the rabbits. In other words, the time connection is of no consequence and therefore does not exist. Similar situations arise occasionally in narrative films.</p>
        <p>If sequences are meant to follow each other in time, the content of the film must make this relationship clear, precisely as in the case of simultaneity; because the fact that two sequences follow each other on the screen does not indicate in itself that they should be understood as following each other in time.</p>
        <p>Film can take far greater liberties with space and time, however, than the theater can. To be sure, in the theater it is also permissible to have one scene occur at quite a different time and place from the preceding scene. But scenes with a realistic continuity of place and time are very long-drawn-out and allow of no break. Any change is indicated by a definite interruption—the curtain is lowered or the stage darkened. It might, nevertheless, be imagined that an audience would find it disturbing to see so many disconnected events on one and the same stage. That this is not so is due to a very curious fact: the illusion given by a play (or film) is only partial. Within any particular scene value is laid on naturalism. The characters must talk as people do in real life, a servant like a servant, a duke like a duke. (But even here we have this restriction: the servant and the duke are to talk clearly and sufficiently loudly, that is really, too clearly and loudly.) An ancient Roman lamp must not be put to light a modern drawing room nor a telephone by Desdemona's bed. Yet the room has only three walls —the fourth, the one that should intervene between the stage and the audience, is missing. Any audience would laugh if a piece of scenery fell down and revealed the wall of the room to be nothing but painted canvas, or if the crack of a shot were heard some seconds before the, revolver was fired. But every audience takes it for granted that on the stage a room has only three walls. This deviation from reality is accepted because the technique of the stage demands it. That is to say, the illusion is only partial.</p>
        <p>The stage is, so to speak, in two different but intersecting realms. It reproduces nature, but only a part of nature—separate in time and space from the actual time and space of the “<span>house</span>” where the audience is located. At the same time, the stage is a showcase, an exhibit, the scene of action. Hence it comes into the domain of the fictitious. The component of illusion is relatively strong in theater because an actual space (the stage) and an actual passage of time are given. The component of illusion <em>is</em> very slight when we are looking at a picture—for example, a photograph lying on the table in front of us. The photograph, like the stage, represents a particular place and a particular time (a moment of time), but it does not do this as is done in the theater with the aid of an actual space and an actual passage of time. The surface of the picture <em>signifies</em> a pictured space; and that is so much of an abstraction that the picture surface in no way gives us the illusion of actual space.</p>
        <p>Film—the animated image—comes midway between the theater and the still picture. It presents space, and it does it not as on the stage with the help of real space, but, as in an ordinary photograph, with a flat surface. In spite of this, the impression of space is for various reasons not so weak as in a still photograph. A certain illusion of depth holds the spectator. Again, in contrast with the photograph, time passes during the showing of a film as it does on the stage. This passage of time can be utilized to portray an actual event, but is, nevertheless, not so rigid that it cannot be interrupted by breaks in time without the spectator feeling that these breaks do violence to it. The truth is that the film retains something of the nature of a flat, two-dimensional picture. Pictures may be displayed for as long or short a time as one pleases, and they can be shown next to one another even if they depict totally different periods in time.</p>
        <p>Thus film, like the theater, provides a partial illusion. Up to a certain degree it gives the impression of real life. This component is all the stronger since in contrast to the theater the film can actually portray real —that is, not simulated—life in real surroundings. On the other hand, it partakes strongly of the nature of a picture in a way that the stage never can. By the absence of colors, of three-dimensional depth, by being sharply limited by the margins on the screen, and so forth, film is most satisfactorily denuded of its realism. It <em>is</em> always at one and the same time a flat picture post card and the scene of a living action.</p>
        <p>From this arises the artistic justification for what <em>is</em> called montage. It was pointed out above that film, which records real situations on strips of celluloid that may be joined together, has the power of placing in juxtaposition things that have no connection at all in real time and space. This power was, however, primarily a purely mechanical one. One might expect the spectator to be overcome by a physical discomfort akin to seasickness when watching a film that had been composed of different shots. For example: In Scene 1 a man is discovered ringing the front doorbell of a house. Immediately following appears a totally different view—the interior of the house with a maid coming to answer the door. Thus the spectator has been jerked violently through the closed door. The maid opens the door and <em>sees</em> the visitor. Suddenly the viewpoint changes again and we are looking at the maid through the visitor s eyes—another breakneck change within the fraction of a second. Then a woman appears in the background of the foyer and in the next moment we have bridged the distance separating us from her, and we are close beside her.</p>
        <p>It might be supposed that this lightning juggling with space would be most unpleasing. Yet everyone who goes to the movies knows that actually there is no sense of discomfort, but that a scene such as the one just described can be watched with perfect ease. How can this be explained? We have been talking as though the sequence had actually taken place. But it <em>is</em> not real and—which is of the greatest importance— the spectators have not the (complete) illusion of its reality. For, as has already been said, the illusion is only partial and film gives simultaneously the effect of an actual happening and of a picture.</p>
        <p>A result of the “<span>pictureness</span>” of film is, then, that a sequence of scenes that are diverse in time and space is not felt as arbitrary. One looks at them as calmly as one would at a collection of picture post cards. Just as it does not disturb us in the least to find different places and different moments in time registered in such pictures, so it does not seem awkward in a film. If at one moment we see a long shot of a woman at the back of a room, and the next we see a close-up of her face, we simply feel that we have “<span>turned over a page</span>” and are looking at a fresh picture. If film photographs gave a very strong spatial impression, montage probably would be impossible. It <em>is</em> the partial unreality of the film picture that makes it possible.</p>
        <p>Whereas the theater stage differs from real life only in that the fourth wall is missing, the setting of the action changes, and the people talk in theatrical language, the film deviates much more profoundly. The position of the spectator is continually changing since we must consider him located at the station point of the camera. A spectator in the theater is always at the same distance from the stage. At the movies the spectator seems to be jumping about from one place to another; he watches from a distance, from close to, from above, through a window, from the right side, from the left; but actually this description, as has been said, is altogether misleading, because it treats the situation as physically real. Instead, pictures taken from the most various angles follow one another, and although the camera position had to be changed continually when they were taken, the spectator is not obliged to duplicate all this commotion.</p>
        <p>Many people who are accustomed to clear thinking will feel that this theory of “<span>partial illusion</span>” is vague and equivocal. Is not the very essence of illusion that it should be complete? Is it possible, when one is surrounded by one's own friends and sitting in a chair at home in New York, to imagine oneself in Paris? Can one believe that one <em>is</em> looking at a room when a moment ago a street was there? Yes; one can. According to an outdated psychology that is still deeply rooted in popular thought, an illusion can be strong only if it is complete in every detail. But everyone knows that a clumsy childish scribble of a human face consisting of two dots, a comma, and a dash may be full of expression and depict anger, amusement, or fear. The impression is strong, though the representation is anything but complete. The reason it suffices is that in real life we by no means grasp every detail. If we observe the expression on somebody's face, we are far from being able to say whether he had blue <em>eyes</em> or brown, whether he was wearing a hat or not, and so on. That is to say, in real life we are satisfied to take in essentials; they give us all that we need to know. Hence if these essentials are reproduced we are content and obtain a complete impression that is all the more artistic for being so strongly concentrated. Similarly, in film or theater, so long as the essentials of any event are shown, the illusion takes place. So long as the people on the screen behave like human beings and have human experiences, it is not necessary for us to have them before us as substantial living beings nor to see them occupy actual space—they are real enough as they are. Thus we can perceive objects and events as living and at the same time imaginary, as real objects and as simple patterns of light on the projection screen; and it is this fact that makes film art possible.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Absence of the Nonvisual World of the Senses</h3>
        <p>Our eyes are not a mechanism functioning independently of the rest of the body. They work in constant cooperation with the other sense organs. Hence surprising phenomena result if the eyes are asked to convey ideas unaided by the other senses. Thus, for example, it is well known that a feeling of giddiness is produced by watching a film that has been taken with the camera traveling very rapidly. This giddiness is caused by the eyes participating in a different world from that indicated by the kinesthetic reactions of the body, which is at rest. The eyes act as if the body as a whole were moving; whereas the other senses, including that of equilibrium, report that it is at rest. Our sense of equilibrium when we are watching a film is dependent on what the eyes report and does not as in real life receive kinesthetic stimulation. Hence certain parallels which are sometimes drawn between the functioning of the human eye and the camera— for instance, the comparison between the mobility of the eyes and that of the camera—are false. If I turn my eyes or my head, the field of vision is altered. Perhaps a moment ago I was looking at the door; now I am looking at the bookcase; then at the dining-room table, then at the window. This panorama, however, does not pass before my eyes and give the impression that the various objects are moving. Instead I realize that the room is stationary as usual, but that the direction of my gaze is changing, and that that is why I see other parts of the motionless room. This is not the case in film. If the camera was rotated while the picture was being shot, the bookcase, table, window, and door will proceed across the screen when the picture is projected; it is they which are moving. For since the camera is not a part of the spectator's body like his head and his eyes, he cannot tell that it has been turned. He can see the objects on the screen being displaced and at first is led to assume that they are in motion. In Jacques Feyder's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Nouveaux Messieurs</em>, for example, there is a scene in which the camera passes rapidly along a long wall covered with posters. The result is that the wall seems to move past the camera. If the scene that has been photographed is very simple to understand, if it is easy to get one's bearings in it, the spectator corrects this impression more or less rapidly. If, for instance, the camera is first directed toward a man's legs and if it then pans slowly up toward his head, the spectator knows very well that the man did not float feet first past a stationary camera. Film directors, however, often turn or shift the camera for taking pictures that are not so easy to grasp, and then a sensation of drifting supervenes which may be unintentional and may easily make the audience feel dizzy. This difference between the movements of the eyes and those of the camera is increased because the film picture has, as was said above, a fixed limit whereas the field of vision of our eyes is practically unbounded. Fresh objects are continually appearing within the frame of the picture and then disappearing again, but for the <em>eyes</em> there is an unbroken space-continuum through which the gaze wanders at will.</p>
        <p>Thus there is relativity of movement in film. Since there are no bodily sensations to indicate whether the camera was at rest or in motion, and if in motion at what speed or in what direction, the camera's position is, for want of other evidence, presumed to be fixed. Hence if something moves in the picture this motion is at first seen as a movement of the thing itself and not as the result of a movement of the camera gliding past a stationary object. In the extreme case this leads to the direction of motion being reversed. If, for example, a moving car is filmed from a second one which <em>is</em> overtaking the first, the finished picture will show a car apparently traveling backward. It is, however, possible to make clear which movement is relavive and which absolute by the nature and behavior of the objects shown in the picture. If it <em>is</em> obvious from the picture that the camera was standing on a moving car, that is, if parts of this car are seen in the picture, and, contrary to the landscape, they stay in the same place in the picture, the car will be perceived as moving and the surrounding landscape as stationary.</p>
        <p>There is also a relativization of spatial coordinates— above, below, and so forth. To this are partly due the phenomena we described above in the section on the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Delimitation of the Image</span>”. A photograph of a slanting surface may not give an appearance of slope because there is no sensation of gravity to help the spectator realize “<span>up and down</span>”. It is impossible to feel whether the camera was standing straight or was placed at an angle. Therefore, as long as there is nothing to indicate the contrary, the projection plane is perceived as vertical. If the camera is held over a bed to show from above the head of a man lying in it, the impression may easily be given that the man <em>is</em> sitting upright and that the pillow is perpendicular. The screen is vertical, although since the camera was turned downward it actually represents a horizontal surface. This effect can be avoided only by showing enough of the surroundings in the picture to give the spectator his bearings.</p>
        <p>As regards the other senses: No one who went unprejudiced to watch a silent film missed the noises which would have been heard if the same events had been taking place in real life. No one missed the sound of walking feet, nor the rustling of leaves, nor the ticking of a clock. The lack of such sounds (speech, of course, is also one of them) was hardly ever apparent, although they would have been missed with a desperate shock in real life. People took the silence of the movies for granted because they never quite lost the feeling that what they saw was after all only pictures. This feeling alone, however, would not be sufficient to prevent the lack of sound being felt as an unpleasant violation of the illusion. That this did not happen is again connected with what was explained above: that in order to get a full impression it is not necessary for it to be complete in the naturalistic sense. All kinds of things may be left out which would be present in real life, so long as what is shown contains the essentials. Only after one has known talkies is the lack of sound conspicuous in a silent film. But that proves nothing and is not an argument against the potentialities of silent film, even since the introduction of sound.</p>
        <p>It is much the same with the sense of smell. There may be people who if they see a Roman Catholic service on the screen imagine that they can smell incense; but no one will miss the stimulus. Sensations of smell, equilibrium, or touch are, of course, never conveyed in a film through direct stimuli, but are suggested indirectly through sight. Thence arises the important rule that it is improper to make films of occurrences whose central features cannot be expressed visually. Of course a revolver shot might occur as the central point of a silent film; a clever director could afford to dispense with the actual noise of the shot. It is enough for the spectator to see the revolver being fired and possibly to see the wounded man fall. In Josef von Sternberg's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Docks of New York</em> a shot is very cleverly made visible by the sudden rising of a flock of scared birds.</p>
        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em>2 The Making of a Film</em></h2>
        <p>It has been shown above that the images we receive of the physical world differ from those on the movie screen. This was done in order to refute the assertion that film <em>is</em> nothing but the feeble mechanical reproduction of real life. The analysis has furnished us with the data from which we can hope to derive now the principles of film art.</p>
        <p>By its very nature, of course, the motion picture tends to satisfy the desire for faithful reports about curious, characteristic, exciting things going on in this world of ours. The first sensation provided by film in its early music-hall days was to depict everyday things in a lifelike fashion on the screen. People were greatly thrilled by the sight of a locomotive approaching at top speed or the emperor in person riding down <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Unter den Linden</em>. In those days, the pleasure given by film derived almost entirely from the subject matter. A film art developed only gradually when the movie makers began consciously or unconsciously to cultivate the peculiar possibilities of cinematographic technique and to apply them toward the creation of artistic productions. To what extent the use of these means of expression affects the large audiences remains a moot question. Certainly box-office success depends even now much more on what is shown than on whether it is shown artistically.</p>
        <p>The film producer himself is influenced by the strong resemblance of his photographic material to reality. As distinguished from the tools of the sculptor and the painter, which by themselves produce nothing resembling nature, the camera starts to turn and a likeness of the real world results mechanically. There is serious danger that the film maker will rest content with such shapeless reproduction. In order that the film artist may create a work of art it is important that he consciously stress the peculiarities of his medium. This, however, should be done in such a manner that the character of the .objects represented should not thereby be destroyed but rather strengthened, concentrated, and interpreted. Our next task will be to bring examples to show how the various peculiarities of film material can be, and have been, used to achieve artistic effects.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Artistic Use of Projections Upon a Plane Surface</h3>
        <p>In an earlier section I showed what conditions arise from the fact that in a photographic representation three-dimensional bodies and spaces are projected on a two-dimensional plane, that is, the surface of the picture. It was first demonstrated that an object can be reproduced characteristically or otherwise according to what view of it is chosen. When film art was in its infancy, nobody paid much attention to the subleties of these problems. The camera was stationed well in front of the people to be photographed in order that their faces and movements might be easily seen. If a house was to be shown, the cameraman placed himself straight in front of it at such a distance that nothing would be left out of the picture. It was only gradually that the particular effects that can be achieved by means of perspective projection were realized.</p>
        <p>In Chaplin's film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Immigrant</em> the opening scene shows a boat rolling horribly and all the passengers being seasick. They stagger to the side of the ship pressing their hands to their mouths. Then comes the first shot of Charlie Chaplin: he is seen hanging over the side with his back to the audience, his head well down, his legs kicking wildly—everyone thinks the poor devil is paying his toll to the sea. Suddenly Charlie pulls himself up, turns round and shows that he has hooked a large fish with his walking stick. The effect of surprise is achieved by making use of the fact that the spectator will be looking at the situation from a certain definite position. The idea underlying the scene is no longer “<span>a man is doing such and such a thing, for example, he is fishing or being sick</span>”, but “<span>a man is doing this and that, <em>and</em> at the same time the spectator is watching him from a particular station point</span>”. The element of surprise exists only when the scene is watched from one particular position. If the scene had been taken from the waterside, the audience would have realized at once that Charlie was not being sick but was fishing; and hence the wrong idea would not have first been implanted. The invention is no longer concerned merely with the subject matter but is cinematographic inasmuch as a definite feature of film technique is being used as a means to secure an effect.</p>
        <p>It <em>is</em> in the nature of such a scene that what is happening should not be obvious to the audience. In order to obtain a special effect the artist works exactly contrary to the principle of “<span>the most characteristic view</span>”. In Dupont's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vaudeville</em> the first appearance of the central character <em>is</em> planned on much the same principle. The convict Jannings is seated opposite the examining magistrate; his face <em>is</em> not yet visible, only his broad back can be seen with a large numeral sewed to his coat. Thus with the help of a pictorial symbol an idea which in itself is abstract, purely intellectual, and unvisual—“<span>This is only one of a crowd, not an individual but simply a number</span>”—is made manifest. In a film planned on more fantastic lines the convict might have been shown without a head and in place of the head a number floating above the trunk—as is sometimes done in caricatures (a businessman's body surmounted by a dollar sign instead of a human head). What <em>is</em> arresting, however, in Dupont's scene <em>is</em> that in order to symbolize the abstract it was not found necessary to interfere with reality. An entirely natural view, justified by the action, was chosen, and the desired effect was obtained purely by taking the shot from a particular angle—an unforced, specific occurrence, the view so chosen and so recorded that it was typical and symbolic.</p>
        <p>Thus the conditions under which the picture is taken (in our example, the choice of a particular angle of approach) are not treated as negligible quantities or necessary evils, but are consciously brought into relief as factors contributing to the composition of the picture. The artistic effect is, indeed, achieved precisely by using them. The episode “<span>Conversation between magistrate and convict</span>” in itself is distinguished from the reproduction of this episode by the particular standpoint from which the reproduction was made. It had to be selected definitely out of a hundred visual possibilities. But this very “<span>limitation</span>” yields the artistic opportunity of making the particular pictured event convey an idea.</p>
        <p>The present attempt to make a systematic analysis must not be taken as a psychological description of how this scene was invented. In other words, it must not be taken to mean that Dupont's mental process was something like this: “<span>I must have a symbolic representation of a convict as nothing but a number. What method shall I use to produce this effect? Ah! The camera angle ... let me think . . .</span>” It may have happened the other way around. The director may accidentally have seen the convict from the back and thus have lit on the happy idea. We are here concerned only with analyzing the finished work and studying its effects.</p>
        <p>In the Russian films—other people have copied the idea—the domineering forcefulness of a character is often expressed by taking the shot from the worm's-eye view. An iron captain of industry or a general—the camera looks up at him as at a mountain. Here again the fact that the actor has to be taken from some particular point of view is not handled perfunctorily but is consciously exploited: the perspective angle acquires meaning, a virtue is made of necessity.</p>
        <p>A twofold effect can be produced by a clever position of the-camera. If an artistic impression is to be achieved, this double effect is necessary; and must not only show the subject in characteristic fashion but must at the same time satisfy the spectator's sense of form. To photograph an autocrat from below not only points the effect which the figure is to have upon the audience, but, if cleverly executed, it also results in an arresting play of form. It is unusual—or was until a few years ago—consciously to perceive such a distorted view of the human body. The hugeness of the body, the head—appearing very small because of the foreshortening—far away on top of the figure, the curious displacement of the facial structure (the way the tip of the nose with its two black caverns juts out over the mustache; the chin seen from below)—all this possesses a strong formal interest which need not imply anything with regard to the content. The strangeness and unexpectedness of this view have the effect of a clever <em class="notranslate" translate="no">coup d'esprit</em> (“<span>to get a fresh angle on a thing</span>”), it brings out the unfamiliar in a familiar object. Rene Clair's film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Entr'acte</em> contains a picture of a ballet girl dancing on a sheet of glass. The photograph has been taken from below through the glass. As the girl dances, her gauze skirts open and close like the petals of a flower and in the middle of this corolla comes the curious pantomime of the legs. The pleasure derived from so curious a shot <em>is</em> at first purely formal and is divorced from all meaning. It arises solely from the pictorial surprise. If in addition it had some significance, its value would be all the greater. The erotic element of the dance, for instance, might be brought into prominence at will by such a position of the camera.</p>
        <p>Camera angles are often chosen solely on account of their formal interest and not for their meaning. A director has perhaps discovered some ingenious viewpoint which he insists on using even though it signifies nothing. In a good film every shot must be contributory to the action. Nevertheless, directors very often allow themselves to be led into violating this principle. They will show two people in conversation; they will take the picture from the level and then suddenly from the ceiling, looking down onto the heads, even though the shift in viewpoint brings out or proves or explains nothing. All that these directors have succeeded in accomplishing is the betrayal of their art.</p>
        <p>In Carl Dreyer's beautiful film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Passion of Joan of Arc</em> long discussions take place between priests and the Maid. This is an unfruitful theme for the camera. The real interest of these scenes lies in the spoken word. Visually there is little variety to be extracted from the endless confrontations of arguing speakers. The solution of the diflSculty is surely to avoid putting scenes like this into a silent film. Carl Dreyer decided otherwise, and mistakenly. He tried to animate these cinematographically uninspiring episodes by variety in form. The camera was most active. It took the Maid's head obliquely from above; then it was aimed diagonally across her chin. It looked up the ecclesiastical judge's nostrils, ran rapidly toward his forehead, took him from the front as he put one question, from the side as he put the next—in short, a bewildering array of magnificent portraits, but lacking in the slightest artistic meaning. This byplay contributes nothing to the spectator's comprehension of the examination of the Maid; on the contrary, the spectator is irrelevantly entertained to prevent his being bored by what should be exciting. Form for form's sake—this is the rock on which many film artists, especially the French, are shipwrecked.</p>
        <p>The curious camera angles to be found in many recent films—adopted either with artistic intent or merely for their own sake—were looked upon as malpractices in the early days of photography and film. In those days anyone would have been ashamed to present an audience with an oblique camera angle. What are the reasons for this change?</p>
        <p>The fascination of the early films lay in the movement on the screen of objects which exactly resembled their originals in real life and behaved like them down to the minutest detail. This attitude toward film naturally determined the position from which shots were taken. Whatever was to be shown was taken from the angle which most clearly presented it and its movements. The task of the camera was in fact considered to be merely that of catching and registering life. The idea that the manner in which this was done might be of value in itself or do the job of recording information even more efficiently was not yet considered. People were not in those days dealing with film as an art but merely as a medium of recording. “<span>Distortion</span>” was obviously wrong since it was not yet intentional.</p>
        <p>Only gradually, and at first probably without conscious intention, the possibility of utilizing the differences between film and real life for the purpose of making formally significant images was realized. What had formerly been ignored or simply accepted was now intelligently developed, displayed, and made into a tool to serve the desire for artistic creation. The object as such was no longer the first consideration. Its place in importance was taken by the pictorial representation of its properties, the making apparent of an inherent idea, and so forth.</p>
        <p>Another aspect remains to be touched upon. An unusual camera angle (such as those mentioned above) has still another result apart from characterizing the object in a particular sense and introducing an attractive element of surprise by the unexpected shapes which a familiar object can assume. Pudovkin has said that film strives to lead the spectator beyond the sphere of ordinary human conceptions. For the ordinary person in everyday life, sight is simply a means of finding his bearings in the natural world. Roughly speaking, he sees only so much of the objects surrounding him as <em>is</em> necessary for his purpose. If a man is standing at the counter of a haberdasher's shop, the salesman will presumably pay less attention to the customer's facial expression than to the kind of tie he is wearing (so as to guess his taste) and to the quality of his clothes (so as to know what his requirements are likely to be). But when the same man enters his office his secretary will doubtless pay less attention to his tie than to his facial expression (so as to know what sort of temper he is in). It is a well-known fact that many married couples do not know the color of each other's eyes; that people are ignorant of the very pictures hanging on the walls of their dining rooms; that they do not know what the carpet on their floors is like; and that they have never noticed how their servants are dressed. It is indeed exceptional—apart from persons of aesthetic tastes and training—for any-one suddenly to lose himself in gratuitous contemplation, to watch his neighbors hands, to examine the telephone for its shape, to observe the play of shadows on the pavement.</p>
        <p>In order to understand a work of art, however, it is essential that the spectator's attention should be guided to such qualities of form, that is, that he should abandon himself to a mental attitude which is to some extent unnatural. For example, it is no longer merely a matter of realizing that “<span>there stands a policeman</span>”; but rather of realizing “<span>how he is standing</span>” and to what extent this picture is characteristic of policemen in general. Notice how well the man is selected; what a characteristic movement that one is in comparison with another, more obvious movement; and how the forcefulness of the figure is brought out by the shot being taken from below!</p>
        <p>There are also certain artifices by which the spectator may be induced to assume such an attitude. If an ordinary picture of some men in a rowing boat appears on the screen, the spectator will perhaps merely perceive that here is a boat, and nothing further. But if, for example, the camera is suspended high up, so that the spectator sees the boat and the men from above, the result is a view very seldom seen in real life. The interest is thereby diverted from the subject to the form. The spectator notices how strikingly spindle-shaped is the boat and how curiously the bodies of the men swing to and fro. Things that previously remained unnoticed are the more striking because the object itself as a whole appears strange and unusual The spectator is thus brought to see something familiar as something new. At this moment he becomes capable of true observation. For it <em>is</em> not only that he is now stimulated to notice whether the natural objects have been rendered characteristically or colorlessly, with originality or obviously, but by stimulating the interest through the unusualness of the aspect the objects themselves become more vivid and therefore more capable of eflFect. In watching a good shot of a horse I shall have a much stronger feeling that “<span>here is an actual horse—a big beast with a satiny skin, and with such and such a smell . . .</span>” That is to say, therefore, not only form but also objective qualities will impose themselves more compellingly. It must, however, be mentioned that if this method is applied unskillfully it leads to the opposite result and may produce a view of the object which makes it quite unrecognizable, or which shows it so much out of character that the eflFect is not strengthened but lost.</p>
        <p>It may be convenient to summarize briefly here what has been said in the above paragraphs:</p>
        <p>It is a property of photography that it must represent solids “<span>one-sidedly</span>” as plane pictures. This reduction of the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional is a necessity of which the artist makes a virtue. It is the means by which he achieves the following results:</p>
        <p>1) By reproducing the object from an unusual and striking angle, the artist forces the spectator to take a keener interest, which goes beyond mere noticing or acceptance. The object thus photographed sometimes gains in reality and the impression it makes is livelier and more arresting.</p>
        <p>2) The artist, however, does not direct the attention merely toward the object itself, but also to its formal qualities. Stimulated by the provocative unfamiliarity of the aspect, the spectator looks more closely and observes (a) how the new perspective shows up all sorts of unexpected shapes in the various parts of the object, and (b) how the solid which has been projected onto a plane surface now fills the space as a flat picture with a pleasing arrangement of outlines and shadow masses—thus making a good and harmonious effect. This design is achieved without any distortion or violation of the object, which appears simply as “<span>itself</span>”. Hence the striking artistic effect.</p>
        <p>3) Guiding the attention to the formal attributes of the object has the further result that the spectator now feels inclined to consider whether the object has been chosen characteristically and whether its behavior is characteristic; in other words, whether it is a representative example of its genus (for example, “<span>a typical official</span>”) and whether it moves and reacts in conformity with its species.</p>
        <p>4) The novel camera angle, however, serves not only as an alarm and decoy. By showing the object from a particular point of view, it can interpret it, more or less profoundly (“<span>The convict as a number</span>”). Here too, there is a special charm in that to obtain this result the object has in no way been changed or touched up, but has been left exactly as it appears in real life.</p>
        <p>The projection of solids upon a plane not only implies that each individual object must be shown from a particular angle, but the relative positions of various bodies, the way they cut into one another, must also be discussed. Physical bodies occupy a position in space; one can walk about amongst them, look at each separately. But if a film camera is placed in a particular spot—the traveling camera will not at present be considered—it sees the objects one behind the other exactly as does the human eye (when the observer is standing still), one object obstructing the view of another. And this limitation again helps the artist to achieve quite special effects. Let us take a notable example:</p>
        <p>In Alexander Room's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ghost That Never Returns</em> the following fine scene occurs. A convict has been released from prison. He <em>is</em> seen going away from the audience down a long road between two enormously high stone walls. In a crack in the wall he finds something which he has probably not seen for years—a little flower. The flower serves as the (somewhat banal) symbol of nature and freedom, which he has been obliged to forgo for so long. He picks the flower. Then he suddenly loses his temper, turns about to face the camera, raises his fists threateningly, and shakes them in the direction from which he has been coming. And at this moment the camera leaps to a different position. The direction of view is exactly the same, but the camera is moved a few yards back and now is unexpectedly placed behind the bars of the prison from which the prisoner has just gone out to freedom. The bars now occupy the foreground, very large, covering the whole area of the picture. And through them the same scene appears as before—the road with the ex-convict raising his arms threateningly. This trick on the part of the director is extraordinarily impressive— and most instructive.</p>
        <p>The effect is achieved by skillfully making the most of the necessity of deciding upon some one “<span>angle</span>”. Setting aside the film camera, and considering only the actual situation, it resolves itself into a barred gate, beyond it a rbad between two long walls, and a man walking down this road. Any number of camera angles were possible. The camera might have been put at the end of the road. The prison with its barred gate would then have been in the background. The man might have been shown going out through the gate; and the camera might have moved out to freedom with him. A bird's-eye view of the scene might have been presented which would have given a good survey of the whole episode in its surroundings. The angle which the director chose does not give any such general survey. In the first shot the prison is not visible at all. In the second, nothing of the prison <em>is</em> shown but the bars, notwithstanding that the convict has just emerged from the prison, which therefore <em>is</em> a vital element in the scene. It is nevertheless by this very means that the desired effect is achieved. Thus we see again that the artist very often chooses angles which do not at all give the clearest, most obvious, complete prospect of a scene.</p>
        <p>Since the film director must decide upon a particular camera angle, he is able to select what objects he will allow to appear <em>in</em> the picture; to conceal what he does not wish to show, or does not wish to show at once (this is done by placing the camera so that the undesired objects are screened by other objects or so that they simply do not come into the picture at all); to bring into prominence whatever he considers to be important, and very possibly would not of itself show its importance in the scene. In other words, the film director can emphasize objects—make one object conspicuous, hide another that may be disturbing or unimportant, without interfering with the objects themselves or altering them in any way. Moreover, he is able to move objects about so as to emphasize their relation to each other—a relation that may be visually obvious only by placing the camera in some one definite position.</p>
        <p>In the first shot in Room's film nothing is seen of the grating, that is, the prison theme does not appear in the picture at all. The spectator <em>sees</em> the convict walking along the road at liberty, freed from the cell. And suddenly the man revolts and the object of his indignation—his imprisonment—is brought into the picture by a brilliant artifice without the necessity for a change of scene. (In many films a picture of the prison or of a cell would have been inset.) The desired effect is simply extracted from the given situation. The grating enters the scene to act as a partner to the liberated convict.</p>
        <p>The special excellence of the invention lies not so much in that the prison theme is brought into the picture at all, as in the manner in which it is done. All at once the heavy iron bars of the grating cover the whole screen—the whole view. And these bars are gigantic compared with the man who is playing his part far back in the picture and therefore appears very small. A most convincing symbol of the tremendous power which he is threatening impotently and which still oppresses him.</p>
        <p>The film artist who makes a virtue of necessity in taking his shots from a definite angle arranges the objects as he wishes, puts what seems to him important in the foreground, hides other things, suggests relationships. The man and the grating are actually separated by a considerable distance. If the camera had been differently placed, this distance would have been very marked; it might in fact even have proved impossible to get the two objects into the same picture. It is the particular location of the camera that produces the significant connection: man—grating. The grating, which might have remained quite unimpressive if some other angle had been chosen for the shot, and certainly would have remained unnoticed in its symbolic meaning, gains its dominant role from the fact that at first it is not there and then is added to the picture while everything else remains the same. It thereby brings itself into prominence and makes clear that it was not introduced without definite intention. It makes its entrance as if it were one of the actors. Here we see how the film artist quite definitely guides the spectators attention, gives him directions, indicates the interpretation he is to put upon objects.</p>
        <p>It <em>is</em> but seldom and only in the works of great film artists that such a deeply symbolic meaning is produced by such simple means. Usually the significance lies more superficially, sometimes there is none at all. In Pabst's film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Diary of a Lost Girl</em> a pharmacist's assistant is seen kissing his employer's daughter. They are standing by the glass door of the shop. The scene <em>is</em> first taken from the interior. The camera is standing in the shop. The shot shows the two kissing each other and beyond them the door which leads out into the street. Then the scene is suddenly shown from another angle—the couple remain in exactly the same position, but the camera is now outside the door and they are seen through the glass. There seems to be no point in this change of the camera's position. It signifies nothing. And things which have no significance have no place in a work of art. The reason for the sequence of the two shots is wholly superficial and decorative. It is attractive to the eye to see the same scene first from within and then from without through the glass panel—a pleasure comparable, perhaps, with that experienced when a composer presents a theme first in the major and then in the minor key. In music such a change of the mode must be justified by the total sequence, so also it must be in a film. Here the device is insufficiently motivated and therefore artistically weak. There might have been sound reason for using these two camera angles, if after the second shot someone were shown looking through the door and watching the scene from outside. This would motivate the sequence through the plot. The viewpoint of the action would have been neatly shifted by means of shot 2 from the interior of the shop to the observer outside, and the change in position of the camera would have been justified artistically. But even then the invention would be somewhat shallow inasmuch as it serves only to give a clever visual interpretation of the action and lacks symbolic depth. (This must not be taken to imply that every shot should be expected to provide the depth of the grating scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ghost That Never Returns</em>. On the contrary, the richness of a film composition is served by the varying degrees of profundity underlying the shots.)</p>
        <p>In the two examples we have given, a connection is established by means of perspective between two features of a situation—grating and convict in one case, glass door and lovers in the other. This requires transparent objects like the grating and the glass. In other cases, having one object in front of another may serve to conceal the latter. Three examples taken from three dissimilar films will serve to illustrate this device.</p>
        <p>The following instance is very much like that chosen from Charlie Chaplin's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Immigrant</em> and <em>is</em> in fact taken from one of his shorter films. Charlie has been deserted by his wife because he is a drunkard. He is standing with his back to the camera by a table on which is his wife's photograph. His shoulders are heaving, he is apparently sobbing bitterly. The next moment he turns round. The heaving of his shoulders reveals itself to be the result of his manipulation of a cocktail shaker. Thus the camera angle, which at first presents the scene so that the actual occurrence cannot be seen but only inferred, is once again very skillfully used. The opacity of most physical objects, which makes one body conceal the other from sight, would seem to be a liability for the film artist. This is true, and we shall later see how film directors overcome this obstacle. On the other hand, however, skillful use of this optical fact makes possible a game of hide-and-seek resulting in an unexpected artistic denouement. The revelation is especially effective because there has been no obvious concealment beforehand, no artificial suggestion of secrecy. There is nothing particularly noteworthy about seeing the back view of a man. One feels that one knows exactly what Chaplin is doing: he is sobbing—very naturally, too, since his wife has run away. Hence the spectator feels quite confident that he has grasped the meaning of the scene correctly; the little man then turns round and the surprise “<span>comes off</span>”.</p>
        <p>In the crime film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Mysterious Lady</em> the following scene occurs: Greta Garbo, as a spy, has killed a Russian general in his study. She is in imminent danger of discovery. Outside the door are some soldiers waiting to come in. The general is lying dead in his armchair. The wide back of the armchair is facing the door. Thus the dead man cannot be seen from the door. His forearm is hanging over the arm of the chair and can be seen from the door. The soldiers knock peremptorily. Greta Garbo sits on the arm of the chair and says “<span>Come in!</span>” The camera is now placed so that the spectators see the room exactly as do the soldiers on entering—the wide back of the chair, the general's hand hanging over the arm of the chair, and Greta Garbo sitting beside him with her face turned to the door, that is, toward the audience. The soldiers salute and ask for orders. Greta Garbo turns to the dead man and apparently asks for instructions. She then turns back and communicates these instructions to the soldiers. The soldiers turn right about and march out of the room. The danger has been averted.</p>
        <p>In Eisenstein's film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The General Line</em> a poor peasant woman comes to the farm of a rich man to borrow a horse. The fat kulak <em>is</em> lying on a couch. The woman stands before him and addresses him humbly. He sits up. The camera is then placed behind him. His broad back is seen looming large and heavy in the foreground, finally blotting out entirely the woman who is standing in the background. The whole picture is suddenly filled and dominated by this huge elephantine back. Here again power and arrogance are expressed by means of a clever choice of position. Through being placed close to the camera the back appears particularly large, fat, space-devouring. The peasant woman in the background is very small by contrast. Then an idea is suggested—“<span>power obliterating helplessness</span>”— and the woman disappears from the picture altogether.</p>
        <p>In contrast with this is a scene from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ghost That Never Returns</em>, in which one of the prison warders comes into the director's office to deliver a message. The director's high armchair is seen by his desk exactly as the general's armchair in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Mysterious Lady</em>, with its back to the audience. At first there seems to be no one sitting in it. But as soon as the warder begins to speak, a little hunchback man peers round the side of the chair—the director's first appearance. Although the effect is unexpected, it is also fairly pointless. This sudden appearance is nothing more than a trick on the part of the film maker; it is not material to the action, and it has not much more significance than if the director happened to fall down off the chandelier for no reason in particular.</p>
        <p>A cleverly chosen camera angle may produce a vivid impression not only of an isolated object but of a total setting as well. At the beginning of Jacques Feyder's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Nouveaux Messieurs</em> a rehearsal at the opera is in progress. Such scenes have often been shown before and are usually uninteresting. But here is one among many (some of which manage to be effective by other means) in which vividness is achieved by a clever camera angle. The spectator feels as if he were himself in the very center of the bustle of the stage crowd. How is it done? The camera is placed up in the flies among the machinery and looks down upon the stage. Up above in the dark the silhouettes of two stage hands are seen large in the foreground. They lean over to let a rope down onto the stage. The floor of the stage far below is brightly lit up like the bottom of a shaft. Other stage hands are engaged below in spreading out a carpet, and being so far away give the effect of dwarf figures. The rope dangling down to them is given in great foreshortening. Thus its swinging movement appears curiously cramped and jerky. The abysmal depth, the contrast between the brightly lit stage and the dark flies, the jerldng rope, the difference in size between the darkly silhouetted men up above and the others below on the illuminated stage—everything contributes to make the scene startlingly lifelike. One seems to smell the dust and the cold air of the stage.</p>
        <p>It has already been pointed out that the need for choosing a particular camera angle, or in other words of showing the various objects one behind another, often gives rise to difficulties. If, for instance, a man is to be shown standing among a group of people and talking to them, it is very hard to find a viewpoint which will give a good survey of the whole scene. Wherever the camera is set up, the backs of the crowd hide the speaker. One way out of the difficulty <em>is</em> to have the camera looking onto the group from above. The speaker is then seen clearly in the center with his listeners gathered round him. A picture taken from such an angle can be found in Arthur Robinsons <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Night after the Betrayal.===</em> A difficulty which arises a dozen times in every film, and is resolved in as many ways, is a scene between two persons facing each other. It is desired to show clearly the facial expression of both actors. Hence each had best be taken full face. Unfortunately that is precisely what is impossible to do, for when two people are opposite each other only one will be facing the camera, while the other will have his back to it. Both might be given in profile, but this position is seldom interesting, and, moreover, does not give a good view of the faces. Again, one might use montage and show the two figures full face in rapid alternation, thus splitting up the scene one or more times by showing it from the two “<span>best</span>” viewpoints. Or finally, one can risk taking the one player from the back view only. A successful example of this solution is in the Greta Garbo film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Woman of Affairs</em> directed by Clarence Brown. A father is giving his son a dressing down. The father is seen in dark silhouette in the foreground with his back to the camera, very large, very near. Sitting farther back, considerably smaller and in bright light, is the son, facing his father and the camera. Hence the father's face is not visible. But what he is saying can be conjectured from his attitude and gestures and, above all; from the play of expression on the son's face. This lecture of which the spectator is thus indirectly apprised “<span>comes over</span>” most effectively and vividly. Here <em>is</em> yet another example of a virtue made of necessity.</p>
        <p>Other and quite different solutions to this problem are found in Jacques Feyders <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Nouveaux Messieurs</em>. Two lovers, for example, are seen in conversation, with their heads close together. Then a close-up is shown in which half the picture is covered by the dark silhouette of the back of the mans head (the camera being placed behind him), and this head partially conceals the woman's full face, of which the remainder is seen in bright light. The bisection is most expressive. One seems to see more by seeing less. Again, the same two people are in the girl's dressing room at the theater. She is sitting in front of the looking glass making herself up. Her face <em>is</em> seen front view in the glass, and beside it that of the man who is tinkering with something in the background and stealing covert glances at her. Thus the spectator <em>sees</em> both at once in full face—although the two are looking at each other—which of course could not have been achieved without the mirror.</p>
        <p>Leon Moussinac in his very useful book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Pano-ramique du Cinema</em> (in the chapter on Dupont's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vaudeville)</em> points out that the casual succession of clever and appropriate camera angles is an accomplishment of mature film art. Formerly the camera was, as it were, nailed down in front of the actors, while the director tried to place his performers where they would be most clearly seen even at the risk of making the picture somewhat lacking in spontaneity. He says in this connection: “<span>It is particularly important and instructive that in this film the camera has not been considered in a single scene. The camera continually changes its position. The scene, the details, the expressions on the faces of the actors, are taken from the most telling angles. One never <em>sees</em>, for example, several people acting with their faces simultaneously turned to the-camera, as is common in the French and in many American films. Jannings' back is as expressive as his face. If we notice a certain mannerism in this respect, one must at least admit that this mannerism serves its purpose admirably. It proves that the most important and fundamental means of expression has been understood by certain film artists—to shoot from any angle so long as it is the most telling. We know that in film the fourth wall of the room in which the action takes place is not simply left out, but that the camera is brought into the actual room and takes part in the story</span>”.</p>
        <p>It is easy to understand that film directors only very gradually arrived at making effective use of these means. We remarked above that the motion picture derived in the first instance from a desire to record mechanically real events. Not until film began to become an art was the interest moved from mere subject matter to aspects of form. What had hitherto been merely the urge to record certain actual events, now became the aim to represent objects by special means exclusive to film. These means obtrude themselves, show themselves able to do more than simply reproduce the required object; they sharpen it, impose a style upon it, point out special features, make it vivid and decorative. Art begins where mechanical reproduction leaves off, where the conditions of representation serve in some way to mold the object. And the spectator shows himself to be lacking in proper understanding when he is satisfied to notice merely the content: this is the picture of an engine, that of a couple of lovers, and this again of a waiter in a temper. He must be prepared to turn his attention to the form and to be able to judge <em>how</em> the engine, the lovers, the waiter, are depicted.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Artistic Utilization of Reduced Depth</h3>
        <p>Every object reproduced in film appears solid and at the same time flat. This fact contributes greatly to the impressive results achieved by the clever shots discussed in the last section. The worm's-eye view of a man appears as such a great distortion of nature because the depth effect is reduced. The same view looked at in a stereoscope seems much less distorted. The contrast between the vast bulk of the trunk and the disproportionately small head is much less forcible when it is perceived as being due to foreshortening. But if there is only slight feeling of space and if the three-dimensional volume of the pictured object is flattened out, a huge body and a little head are seen.</p>
        <p>The purely formal qualities of the picture come into prominence only because of the lack of depth. Every good film shot is satisfying in a purely formal sense as a linear composition. The lines are harmoniously disposed with reference to one another as well as to the margins. The distribution of light and shade in the shot is evenly balanced. Only because the spatial effect is so slight, the spectator's attention is drawn to the two-dimensional pattern of lines and shadow masses. These, after all, are actually the components of three-dimensional bodies and become elements of the surface composition only through being projected onto a plane. It has already been mentioned above how the skirt of a dancer seen through a pane of glass seemed to open and close like the petals of a flower. This is an entirely antifunctional effect in that it is not a normally characteristic feature of the skirt as a material object. The curious expansion and contraction of the edge of the skirt results only when it is looked at from one particular viewpoint and then projected upon a flat surface. It would be less noticeable in a stereoscopic view. Only when the feeling of depth is reduced does the up-and-down movement of the skirt give the effect of being an in-and-out movement. It is one of the most important formal qualities of film that every object that <em>is</em> reproduced appears simultaneously in two entirely different frames of reference, namely the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional, and that as one identical object it fulfills two different functions in the two contexts.</p>
        <p>The reduction of depth serves, moreover, to emphasize the perspective superposition of objects. In a strongly stereoscopic picture the manner in which these various objects, are placed relative to one another does not impose itself any more than it does in real life. The concealing of certain parts of the various objects by others that come in front seems chance and unimportant. Indeed, the position of the camera in a stereoscopic picture seems itself to be a matter of indifference inasmuch as it is obvious that there is a three-dimensional space which may just as easily, and at the next moment probably will, be looked at from another point of view. If, however, the effect of depth is almost negligible, the perspective is conspicuous and compelling. What is visible and what is hidden strike one as being definitely intentional; one is forced to seek for a reason, to be clear in one's own mind as to why the objects are arranged in this particular way and not in some other. There is no leeway between the objects: they are like flat surfaces stuck over one another, and seem almost to lie in the same plane.</p>
        <p>Thus the lack of depth brings a very welcome element of unreality into the film picture. Formal qualities, such as the compositional and evocative significance of particular superimpositions, acquire the power to force themselves on the attention of the spectator. A shot like that described above where half of the girl's full face is cut off by the dark silhouette of the man's head, would possess only a fraction of its effectiveness if there were a strong feeling of space. In order to achieve the striking effect it is essential that the division across the face shall not seem accidental but intentional. The two faces must seem to be practically in one plane, with no leeway between them to show that they might easily be moved into different relative positions.</p>
        <p>The fact that the lack of depth perception also leads to the almost total disappearance of the phenomena which the psychologist calls the “<span>constancies</span>” of size and form has already been discussed. The film artist takes advantage of their absence to produce remarkable effects. Everyone has seen a railway engine rushing on the scene in a film. It seems to be coming straight at the audience. The effect is most vivid because the dynamic power of the forward-rushing movement is enhanced by another source of dynamics that has no inherent connection with the object itself, that is, with the locomotive, but depends on the position of the spectator, or—in other words—of the camera. The nearer the engine comes the larger it appears, the dark mass on the screen spreads in every direction at a tremendous pace (a dynamic dilation toward the margins of the screen), and the actual objective movement of the engine is strengthened by this dilation. Thus the apparent alteration in the size of an object which in reality remains the same size enhances its actual activity, and thus helps the film artist to interpret the impact of that activity visually.</p>
        <p>The same principle is brought into play when Carl Dreyer in his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Passion of Joan of Arc</em> stresses a monk suddenly jumping up excitedly from his seat by placing the camera closely in front of the actor so that through this forward movement his figure grows to an enormous size and occupies the whole screen. Here again the effect of actual dynamic force is intensified by something that is purely of the camera— the sudden rapid extension of the flat projection. If the camera had been placed at a distance of several yards from the monk, the perspective increase in size due to the forward movement would be so slight that it would hardly produce an effect at all.</p>
        <p>Pudovkin makes excellent use of perspective alteration in size in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The End of St. Petersburg</em>. Two starving peasants come to the great city to find work. The vast-ness of the city compared with the two figures, their personal unimportance and that of their desires in these surroundings, are very strikingly shown in the following shot: In the foreground is a huge dark equestrian statue of a tsar, whose stone hand is imperiously raised. In the background is a wide empty square across which the two peasants are walking, looking like ants. If the depth effect in the shot were great, that is, if the distance between the statue and the two peasants were wholly perceivable, firstly, the difference in size would not be so remarkable but would seem only the natural result of the distance; and, secondly, the two people and the statue would not be so clearly associated and therefore compared with one another. They would obviously lie in quite different planes. In the Pudovkin shot, the spectator sees a spatial situation that he can interpret on the basis of his past experience but that, nevertheless, presents itself to his eyes without the familiar depth effect. Hence two ants are seen to be crawling toward the colossus, and the ants and the colossus are obviously in some kind of connection with one another because their plane of action appears practically identical.</p>
        <p>In reality, the two peasants are not much smaller than the statue, and the shot might easily have been taken the reverse way, so that the two would be huge in the foreground and dwarf the stone tsar to a mere accessory in the background. But the significance of Pudovkin's symbolism is to show the two peasants as pathetic, helpless, frightened little creatures, terrified by the size, the stony brutality, the might of the city. The director has cleverly used his power of altering the sizes to make his idea tangible. It has been achieved, again, without any distortion of the actual objects themselves comparable to that which the Egyptians were in the habit of making in their reliefs when they portrayed a victorious king enormously large and his enemies as tiny little figures.</p>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The General Line</em> Eisenstein has in a similar manner rearranged the natural proportions symbolically. In one scene he wishes to depict a bureaucratic office setup, in which red tape obstructs any reasonable conduct of affairs. An official is seen dictating to a stenographer. The camera is placed immediately in front of the typewriter in order that the machine may appear very large. Its roller moves across the screen like a huge crane; the heads of the typist and the man dictating appear very small behind it. Then there is a bookkeeper: the ledger is enormous and the man writing in it quite small. What is first of all an abstract disparity is made tangible by a corresponding visual one.</p>
        <p>In King Vidors <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Crowd</em> the following impressive scene occurs: A little boy is sitting on the sidewalk with his friends and is telling them, “<span>My father always says . . . </span>”, when he sees a crowd in front of his home—an ambulance—a stretcher being carried into the house. He runs across full of misgivings. And now the following shot is shown: The camera is placed on the second-floor landing, facing down. The front door is seen below, very small, and from it the staircase leads up widening out in vigorous perspective. Downstairs people are crowding into the house through the front door, attracted by the news of the accident. They swarm below like ants. Suddenly the little boy pushes his way through them. He climbs up the stairs, slowly, fearfully, and yet burning with anxiety to learn what has happened. At first he is very small, then he grows larger, the steps become wider, the crowd remains below. He comes nearer, up the wide empty staircase, which grows ever larger as he approaches the camera, and shows more and more empty space about him. He climbs up—terribly alone—a desolate child, bereft of his father.</p>
        <p>The strength of this effect lies in the simplicity and naturalness of the means employed. Nothing <em>is</em> more commonplace than that a staircase gets larger with decreasing distance; but the trite fact, used in this manner, results in a deep, compelling symbolism such as <em>is</em> found in good folk songs.</p>
        <p>It must be noted that in the achievement of such an effect much depends on the art of the cameraman. The director or the script-writer may have planned the shot admirably; but if the cameraman does not choose the position for the camera accurately, if he stations it six inches too high or too low, if he puts it exactly in the middle instead of a couple of feet farther over to the left, if he does not choose the lens with the appropriate focal length, the power of the perspective may not emerge in the shot and the idea fall flat. Moreover, the lights must be correctly placed—a little too much light in the background, a spotlight too near the center of the foreground, may radically change the whole shot and destroy the intended effect.</p>
        <p>In the early days of the film the director was careful not to have any actor put his hands or his feet too near the camera and thus make them come out disproportionately large. That these apparent alterations in size might be exploited and used to achieve an artistic effect was only realized when the film began to be recognized as an art.</p>
        <p>If the artistic capacity of reduced depth has been realized, the efforts of the engineers to create the three-dimensional film will be watched with mixed feelings. In a film which gives a strong illusion of depth the perspective alterations in size have scarcely more effect than they hav^in real life. Their efficacy as an artistic device will be practically negligible. The two-dimensional relationships, of course, become almost as slight, and the manner in which one object appears behind another in space will be so obvious that the projective as well as any inherent symbolic connections will hardly make themselves felt at all. Engineers are not artists. They therefore do not direct their efforts toward providing the artist with a more effective medium, but toward increasing the naturalness of film pictures. It vexes the engineer that film is so lacking in stereoscopic quality. His ideal is exactly to imitate real life. It provokes him that film should be lacking in colors and sounds; and so he devotes his attention to color photography and sound film. The general, artistically untrained public feels much the same. An audience demands the greatest possible likeness to reality in the movies and it therefore prefers three-dimensional film to flat, colored to black-and-white, talkie to silent. Every step that brings film closer to real life creates a sensation. Each new sensation means full houses. Hence the avid interest of the film industry in these technological developments.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Artistic Use of Lighting and of the Absence of Color</h3>
        <p>The question of color is similar to that of depth. When the film artist has to depend on black and white he <em>is</em> offered particularly vivid and impressive effects.</p>
        <p>The painter, who does not—as color film does—take colors ready-made from nature but creates them afresh on his palette, is able by suitable choice of tones, by distribution of color masses, and so forth, to get as far away from nature as is necessary to convey his artistic intention. Judging from what we have seen up to now, the colors in a color film are at best naturalistic—and if owing to imperfect technique they are not yet so, this lack of naturalness does not provide the artist with a potentially useful medium of expression.</p>
        <p>Whereas the artistic possibilities of color film are still wrapt in obscurity, black-and-white has for many years been a recognized and most effective medium. The reduction of actual color values to a one-dimensional gray series (ranging from pure white to dead black) <em>is</em> a welcome divergence from nature which renders possible the making of significant and decorative pictures by means of light and shade.</p>
        <p>The film artist (herein lies the task of the cameraman which is hardly ever properly appreciated) possesses the power to determine very largely what black-and-white values the objects he photographs shall have when projected in the theater. According to how he places his lamps, where he arranges for the shadows to fall, how in out-of-doors work he sets up his camera with regard to the sun, how his screens catch and reflect the light, he can show the same object in the brightest light or in deepest shadow, he can place a light thing in equally light surroundings or let it stand out by contrast against a dark background. This <em>is</em> one of the most important aesthetic possibilities of film. The primitive but always effective symbolism of light versus darkness, white purity versus black evil, the opposition between gloom and radiance, is inexhaustible.</p>
        <p>In Sternberg's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Docks of New York</em>, for example, the two principal actors of the film are characterized in this way. The white face, the white dress, the white hair of the girl are in visual contrast to the black figure of the ship's stoker. Thus, by a happy, artful congruence, the dramatic interplay of two human minds is made evident through the very elements of visual perception—black-and-white patches moving on the screen. It is obvious that the same effects could not be achieved with color film. In a similar way in Granowsky's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Song of Life</em> the gripping birth scene in the operating room achieves its deadly silence and harshness chiefly by the pictorial contrast between the long white operating coats, the white sterile sheets, the white cottonwpol, and the dark rubber gloves of the doctors with their dark instruments. If this contrast had not been brought out so well by the cameraman, the whole effect of the scene would have been lost.</p>
        <p>Consider the face of a blond woman in a film shot: the color of hair and complexion approximate to each other as a curious pale white—even the blue eyes appear whitish; the velvety black bow of the mouth and the sharp dark pencil lines of the eyebrows are in marked contrast. How strange such a face is, how much more intense—because unconventional—is the expression, how much more attention it attracts to itself and to its expression. How much more readily one observes whether the line with which a dense black braid of hair frames a white face is beautiful and suitable. Anyone who has noticed how unreal most film faces appear, how unearthly, how beautiful, how they often give the impression of being not so much a natural phenomenon as an artistic creation—toward which, of course, the art of make-up helps considerably —will get the same pleasure from a good film face as from a good lithograph or woodcut. Anyone who is in the habit of going to film premieres knows how painfully pink the faces of the film actors appear in real life when they come on stage and make their bows after the performance. The stylized, expressive giant masks on the screen do not fit beings of flesh and blood; they are visual material, the stuff of which art is made.</p>
        <p>The composition of the film image is intelligible and striking chiefly because only black, white, and gray masses, black lines on a white ground, or white lines on a black ground, provide the raw material. A comparison may be made with music, in which articulate statements are possible only because definite pitches of sounds have been arranged in scales, and only these sounds are used in a composition. A sensation of pleasure is aroused by hearing how skillfully these sound values succeed one another. Just as music would be impossible without fixed tones and intervals, so any graphic art—apart from its descriptive and representational function—can have a formal value only if the medium with which the work has been done allows clear definition of shape, brightness, size. This is preeminently the case with black-and-white. All first-class films, especially the good Russian and American ones, show such pronounced black-and-white values —no uncharacteristic confusion of vague, indeterminate tones—that their formal qualities instantly spring to the eye.</p>
        <p>The effect of a landscape is almost entirely dependent upon the lighting. There is a famous shot in Walter Ruttmann's symphony of a great city, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Berlin</em>, in which an empty street in the north of Berlin is shown in the early dawn. The curious mistiness of the morning sky, the veiled darkness of the fronts of the buildings—the apportionment of the gray values, in other words—are what gives this shot its charm. The same street and the same camera angle might result in an utterly feeble and ineffective picture. And obviously these differences can be even more pronounced in the studio where the cameraman has the lights under his control. Ruttmann then has a few men walking down the empty street—workmen on their way to the factory. They are seen in black outline against the gray sky; and these figures in the somewhat lighter street help to emphasize the mystery of the dawn, the strange intermediate state between light and darkness.</p>
        <p>One knows the effects that are achieved in crime films by the sudden appearance in a dark room of the spotlight of a pocket lamp that wanders over furniture or perhaps lights up a concealed figure. One knows the wonderful delight that can be given to perceptive eyes by the sensational white of a face that is brightly lit up and in strong relief, the play of clouds scudding across the moon, the shadows of moving leaves on the ground, the flashing of headlights, quivering reflections on water, the shining black of a spot of blood on white skin, the white telegraph wires in Pudovkins <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The End of St. Petersburg</em> that seem to be cut into the black night sky as with an etcher's needle. But these are delights that are only possible <em>in</em> black-and-white.</p>
        <p>If light is cleverly used it also assists in articulating the shape of what is shown. It is only necessary to compare the face of Baranovskaya in one of her Russian films under Pudovkin and in a film made in a foreign studio, such as <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Poison Gas</em>, or <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Life's Like That</em>. It will be noticed that in the Russian film she has very clear-cut features, almost bony, a face vivid and animated by the strong contrasts of light and shade. The same face in the German films appears flat, indistinct, gray, and expressionless. Everything depends on the lighting and the skill with which the shots are taken. Or again, consider Greta Garbo in the German film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Joyless Street</em> and in one of her American films. Leaving aside the fact that the German picture is older than the American ones, and that the art of make-up was less advanced when the German film was made, this wonderful woman's face will hardly be recognizable. In the German film it is chalky and masklike, the skin looks muddy and gray, the eyes are expressionless, the hair seems dusty. In any of the American films her skin has a subdued satiny luster, her clear cool eyes are extraordinarily piercing, and her soft silky hair seems to glow with a mysterious inner radiance. By the help of clever lighting, irregular features can be made to look harmonious, a face can be made to look haggard or full, old or young. It is exactly the same with interiors and landscapes. Depending on the lighting, a room may look warm and comfortable, or cold and bare, large or small, clean or dirty; it may be striking at the first glance, or quite mediocre and insignificant. The effect of aJbright beam of sunshine falling across a dark space could hardly be obtained with the same success in color. The strange fascination of a thundery landscape, the pallid light creeping in under a dark cover; the silhouette of a mountain range against the evening sky; the squalid grayness of an industrial area; waving cornfields; motes dancing in the sunshine between the shadows of tree trunks—all these are black-and-white effects by means of which desired moods may quite naturally be suggested in a narrative film. It is only necessary to remember the famous first act in Fritz Lang's <em>The Nibelungen Saga</em>, where Siegfried is riding through the magic forest.</p>
        <p>The special delight in getting the sense of the texture of ordinary materials—such as dull iron, shining tin, smooth fur, the woolly hide of an animal, soft skin— in film or photograph <em>is</em> also heightened by the lack of hues. To be sure, texture is more faithfully reproducible in colors—as witness the famous paintings of silks by men like Terborch. If the art of giving the illusion of the reality of stuffs rouses great admiration even in painting, the effect is more uncannily exciting when it is obtained without the aid of color—simply in black and white. Occasionally a photographer succeeds in the supremely difficult art of registering surface qualities with an almost magical faithfulness, and thereby giving a particularly genuine picture of his subjects. On the other hand, one often notices how oddly a table set for a meal comes out in a film— what curious black things the people are eating, little blobs, and slimy-smooth shining balls and all kinds of flat things—they cut them up and put them cheerfully into their mouths, but one cannot see what they are.</p>
        <p>Light, just as other properties of film, has been called to serve definite decorative and evocative purposes only as film developed into an art. In the early days any conspicuous light effect was avoided, just as perspective size-alterations and overlapping were shunned. If the effects of the lighting sprang to the eye too obviously in the picture, it was considered a professional error. The American director Cecil B. de Mille tells an instructive story to this effect:</p>
        <p>“<span>I had been accustomed to stage work, and I wanted to use a particular light effect, which I had used in the theater, for a film I was then shooting. In the scene in question, a spy came creeping through a curtain, and in order to make the effect more mysterious, I decided to light only half the spy's face and to leave the rest in darkness. I looked at the result on the screen and found it extraordinarily effective. I was so pleased with this trick of lighting that I used it throughout the film, that is, I used spotlights from one side or the other— a method which is now freely practiced. After I had sent the film to the distributor's office I got a telegram from the manager that surprised me considerably. It ran:—Have you gone mad? Do you suppose we can sell a film for its full price if you only show half a man?</span>”</p>
        <p>The film was rejected until de Mille hit on the idea of bluffing his customers by referring to the recondite authority of a great European artist. He wired back: “<span>If you fellows are such fools that you don't know Rembrandt chiaroscuro when you see it, don't blame me</span>”. That did it. The distributor launched the film with the slogan: “<span>The first film lighted in the Rembrandt style</span>”, asked double the usual price, and got it.</p>
        <p>This story shows to what extent our way of seeing has changed in the last few years. Nowadays even the general public is accustomed to light effects such as those with which de Mille experimented then. But in those days film meant the reproduction of natural objects, and any. formative intrusion was regarded as detracting from truth to nature, that is, from the fundamental object of film. A man who is only half visible is only half a man, and in real life men are never bisected—so Mr. de Mille's picture was no good. A simple equation. The lights must be so placed that all the details of every object would be clearly recognizable; no “<span>disturbing</span>” shadows were wanted but a clear survey. It was only later that the use of light in the service of art was learned.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Artistic Use of the Delimitation of the Picture and of the Distance From the Object</h3>
        <p>Since our eyes can move freely in every direction, our field of vision is practically unlimited. A film image, on the other hand, is definitely bounded by its margins. Only what appears within these margins is visible, and therefore the film artist is forced—has the opportunity—to make a selection from the infinity of real life. In other words, he can choose his “<span>motif</span>”. The delimitation of the image is as much a formative tool as perspective, for it allows of some particular detail being brought out and given special significance; and, conversely, of unimportant things being omitted, surprises being suddenly introduced into the shot, reflections of things that are happening “<span>off</span>” being brought in.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a frame is an absolute essential if the decorative qualities of a picture are to be displayed; one can only consider the filling of the canvas, the allotment of space, and so forth, if there are definite limits to act as framework for the pictorial design. The frame of the image consists of two vertical and two horizontal lines. Every vertical and horizontal line occurring in the shot, therefore, will be supported by these axes. Slanting lines appear as slanting because the margins of the picture are straight, that is, vertical and horizontal; for every deviation requires some visible standard of comparison to show from what it deviates.</p>
        <p>In a good film image, all lines and other directions stand in well-balanced relation to one another and to the margins. They support one another as parallels or are in contrast; they form a quiet or a restless pattern, a complicated or a simple one; and similarly with the distribution of dark and light masses. If the screen were infinitely large, there could be no question of a good organization of the surface, for, in order to achieve it, there must be a limited space to organize. There is no balance in the infinite, except perhaps in wallpaper designs where there is a serial uniformity, which, of course, is hardly applicable to the film.</p>
        <p>The question of the size and proportion of the image is quite topical at present Abel Gance in his Napoleon film took certain scenes for a triptych screen. At the performance three projectors operated simultaneously, so that a sort of panoramic strip resulted, which could be surveyed at a single glance only from a considerable distance. In America, too, various experiments have, been made with enlarged screens. Nevertheless, the greater the surface of projection, the more difficult it is to organize the picture meaningfully. The temptation to increase the size of the screen goes with the desire for colored, stereoscopic, and sound film. It <em>is</em> the wish of people who do not know that artistic effect <em>is</em> bound up with the limitations of the medium and who want quantity rather than quality. They want to keep on getting nearer to nature and do not realize that they thereby make it increasingly difficult for film to be art.</p>
        <p>The experiments with various-sized screens have once again raised the question as to how far the internationally standardized rectangular shape is artistically satisfactory. Statistical inquiries have been made to discover what shapes were preferred by the great masters. The Russian director Eisenstein during his stay in Hollywood gave a lecture advocating the square screen, within which horizontal and vertical rectangles of any proportion could be formed by using different-shaped masks. “<span>Neither the vertical nor the horizontal shape alone is ideal</span>”, he said, “<span>How may the vertical and horizontal tendencies of the film image be satisfied simultaneously? The battlefield for such a conflict is easily found—it is the square. The square is the only shape which <em>is</em> capable of producing all possible rectangles, if portions at the sides, or top and bottom are masked. It may also be used as a whole, in order to impress upon the spectator the cosmic finality of its squareness—particularly in a dynamic sequence of different dimensions, from a tiny square in the middle up to the all-embracing square that includes the whole screen</span>”.</p>
        <p>In the beginnings of photography, and thus also of film art, only all-inclusive images were taken, that is, pictures that contained the whole of the event or object to be represented. Close-ups—a pair of hands, or half a face—could have been taken then as now, but they were not. Things that are technically possible are utilized only after the idea has penetrated that by their means useful and valuable results can be achieved, and not merely forbidden or unsound ones. If one wanted to take a shot of a man, his complete figure, or at least the whole upper part of his body, had to be in the picture. The margins of the screen were considered only in a negative sense—they must not cut parts of anything off. Interest was concentrated entirely on what was to be photographed, and not at all on the manner in which this was to be done. That sections and isolated details could be used creatively was a revolution, the same revolution that had to take place for all the other features of the film medium before it could become art. Just as Cecil B. de Mille's customers objected to having pictures in which faces were only partially illuminated, so it seemed absurd intentionally to cut up a natural object by the margins of the picture. Nowadays, after only a few years have passed, it has become fashionable even for quite mediocre directors to let the range finder go wild from time to time.</p>
        <p>In the film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Cameraman</em>, Buster Keaton is in love with a girl who works at a press-photograph agency. The following scene takes place: It is early morning. The office is being opened up, the employees arrive. The reception room with the counter at which customers are received is shown. This is where the girl works. She enters, takes her coat off, and settles down. Suddenly the camera is shifted a little, and now a hitherto invisible corner of the waiting room comes into the picture, and there sits Buster Keaton, staring stupidly in front of him. He has been sitting there all night waiting to see the girl. This shows that even a long shot may actually be, in a sense, nothing but a detail shot. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Long shot</span>” is of course a relative and inexact term, which cannot be defined, unless by saying: “<span>A long shot includes the whole of everything that is relevant to the particular total situation</span>”. In practice it would be called a long shot if (as in this case) a whole office were shown. But that crucial corner occupied by Buster Keaton does not come into the picture and the whole effect of the shot depends on this. The same event might have been shown in this way: the <em>girt</em> comes up the stairs, opens the door into the office and sees Buster Keaton sitting in the corner. But the whole absurd and extravagant effect arises from the fact that the spectator believes to be seeing all there is to see—an ordinary office with ordinary people working in it—and suddenly, as if he had fallen from the skies, the ridiculous, infatuated boy is discovered, as though waiting from time immemorial in the midst of this businesslike office, in which nothing out of the ordinary is expected. The psychological shock which is given to the spectator might be described theoretically as follows: a complete whole is shown, and the spectator has been lulled to a false security; suddenly the total structure of this whole is altered by an insignificant twist which seems incongruous with what has gone before. Something of the same effect is achieved when Charlie Chaplin is seen in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Smart People</em> marvelously turned out in a top hat and tails; but only the upper part of his body is shown, and suddenly it is discovered that he has no trousers on and is standing there in his underpants. Here again the part that is shown (the upper part of the body) suggests a complete picture (smartly dressed man) and the disclosure shows in quite a different light what has already been seen, and turns it into a caricature.</p>
        <p>Now for an example of an entirely different kind. Sternberg's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Docks of New York</em> has a scene in which a suicide jumps off a boat. Nothing is shown in the shot except the quivering surface of the water in which is seen the reflection of the boat with the woman standing up and then jumping overboard. The woman is shown indirectly by her reflection in the water. The next moment, however, the woman herself is seen falling into the water, at the very spot where her reflection has been. This unexpected sequence of the direct upon the indirect view is most impressive. The effect is achieved by a careful choice of what is to be photographed. The camera is so placed that the most important part of the shot, namely, the boat with the woman on board, does not come in at all—a position which is quite absurd from the standpoint of ordinary representation of an object. The important part of the event, the only reason for which the shot has been taken, only throws its reflection into the picture. But the spectator, who perhaps might have watched a direct shot of the event with merely passing interest, is caught and thrilled by the unusualness of the presentation.</p>
        <p>Similar artistic “<span>tricks</span>” are used frequently. They have almost become conventions—such as the shadow of the creeping villain appearing dark against a light wall. Indeed a shadow often acts as the announcer: it appears before the person throwing it comes on the scene, and by this means directs the audience's interest and attention to whatever is approaching.</p>
        <p>The true virtue of the delimited image appears from the “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">close-up</span>”. The smaller the detail to be photographed, the larger it comes out in the picture. The close-up not only helps the artist give an enlargement of something which would not be obvious as a mere detail of a long shot—for example, that someone's eyes are filled with tears or that a mouse is sitting in a corner of a room—but it also takes some characteristic feature out of the whole. Very often the film artist will introduce his audience to a new situation by means of some such detail. The pendulum of a clock may be shown, then the whole clock, then the camera travels farther back, and people appear sitting in a room and looking anxiously at the clock. The clock is the vital point of the scene and is therefore shown first. In Pabst's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Diary of a Lost Girl</em> the reformatory is introduced in the ^following manner: The hard, ill-natured face of the teacher with hair strained back from her forehead is shown first; then that she is rhythmically beating a gong; then the camera is moved back, and it is seen that she is standing at the head of a table at which the girls are having dinner, and are putting the spoons to their mouths in time to the strokes on the gong. Here again the central point, which is at the same time a detail illustrative of the situation, is picked out so as to direct the spectators' attention along the right lines, and also to provide a certain element of surprise; for a gradual revelation starting from the detail is much more exciting, seizes the spectators' interest much more than if the whole scene were given at once.</p>
        <p>A sequence of scenes leading like this from the detail to the total picture can be given in various ways. Either the whole and the detail can be taken separately and joined together in the finished strip, in which case the shots go from one to the next with a jerk; or else the camera is moved backward, the shot being continuously turned, so that what appears on the screen becomes at the same time smaller and more comprehensive—that is, the detail which was at first large becomes gradually small and slips into its place in the whole scene. Or, thirdly, the camera may be left in position, while the operator works with mobile masks, so that at first the greater part of the picture remains dark and some detail of the scene—say a head—is seen in a small (round) setting, as if through a hole in a curtain. Starting from this hole, then, the whole shot “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">fades in</span>”.</p>
        <p>There are still other ways of using close-ups, and these are much less easy to fit into any definite scheme. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Docks of New York</em> there is a love scene between a sailor and a prostitute. They are sitting drinking, and there is not much sign of love. Then a close-up is cut in, an uncannily lewd detail: she lustfully strokes his naked arm with indecent tattoo marks all over it, as he ripples the muscles on it for her amusement. The same scene taken as a long shot would not be nearly as effective. Instead of the whole man, only his arm appears, a sturdy, naked, lewdly decorated thing—a clever application of the principle of <em>pars pro toto:</em> this woman <em>sees</em> nothing of the man but power, nudity, muscle.</p>
        <p>Similar examples can be found in any film: the feet of a man going upstairs, so as to indicate visually the sound of the steps; the legs of a couple of lovers. Feyder's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Nouveaux Messieurs</em> has a scene depicting the ceremonial opening of a number of new buildings in a workmen's colony. The Minister is in a hurry and makes his inspection more and more rapidly, until the whole procession is positively running. Then comes a close-up: a fat man in the procession, no one in particular, mopping his brow. This man has been picked out as the type of all his fellow sufferers. In Pudovkin's <em>Mother</em> the scenes taking place in the law courts are ushered in by rapidly successive close-ups of the cold gray ashlars of the building, and in one case a huge shot of the boot of one of the soldiers on guard, a dark uncanny apparition, which is an excellent introduction to the mood of the following scenes. The Russians, indeed, have created an entirely new technique of close-ups.</p>
        <p>The possibility of varying the range of the image and the distance from the object thus provides the film artist with the means of splitting up the whole of any scene easily without interfering with reality. Parts may represent the whole, suspense may be created by leaving what is important or remarkable out of the picture. Certain portions may be emphasized so as to induce the spectator to seek symbolic meaning in their appearance. Particular attention may be focused on essential details.</p>
        <p>The close-up, however, has one serious drawback. It easily leaves the spectator in the dark as to the surroundings of the object or part of the object. This is especially true in a film where there are too many close-ups, where hardly any long shots are given, as for instance in Dreyer's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Passion of Joan of Arc</em>, or in a number of Russian films. The close-up shows a human head, but one cannot tell where the man is to whom the head belongs, whether he is indoors or outdoors, and how he is placed in regard to other people—whether close or distant, turning toward them or away from them, in the same room with them or somewhere else. A superabundance of close-ups very easily leads to the spectators having a tiresome sense of uncertainty and dislocation. Thus a film artist will generally find himself obliged not to use close-ups alone but only in conjunction with long shots that will give the necessary information as to the situation in general.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, however, the film artist has a valuable means of expression, which is denied to the stage, in the power of choosing his distance from his subject. In a theater the spectator always remains at the same distance from the scene of action, and hence events and objects can only be shown within certain limits of size. The subtleties of facial expression, for instance, are lost for the majority of the spectators, who are not seated close to the stage. Indeed unless gifted with very sharp eyes or by making use of the unsatisfactory, because falsifying, assistance of opera glasses, the audience even in the first balcony will be able to catch only a fraction of what is shown on the stage.</p>
        <p>It is, however, not only technical matters of visual acuity that are under discussion. The constant distance of the spectator from the stage makes for an unchangeable evaluation of properties and actions on the stage “<span>according to size</span>”, which is most important aesthetically. From a visual standpoint the movements of the actors, their costumes, the sets, are only effective up to a fairly low degree of differentiation. Film can enlarge this range of validity and, which is more important, it can shift it. The spectator may have been looking at a whole room but the next minute the camera can provide quite a different scene on the same spot, in which quite different things form the center of interest, quite different objects come out large and important, and possibly everything that was important in the long shot a moment ago has been omitted. Of a room containing two people only a tiny half-yard-square patch of the table remains and lying on it a flower that had before been unnoticed or, in any case, had taken up only a minute portion of the picture. Toward this flower, now the center of the action, grope the fingers of a hand, equally large, equally important, which was small and inconspicuous and played no part previously.</p>
        <p>The sphere of operation of the film compared with that of the theater is thereby enormously enlarged. It must be added that, even if it were technically possible, emphasis upon the nonhuman element in the theater would be hardly appropriate. The theater depends on the spoken word; ordinary dramatic scenes, whose meaning lies in the dialogue, could never combine to give a homogeneous effect with scenes in which inarticulate things like animals or flowers carried on the action simply by their appearance or by movements accompanied or unaccompanied by sounds. Anything of this kind is only very exceptionally possible on the stage; and even in the kind of sound film that is based essentially on dialogue the introduction of such scenes at important points would produce a disturbing and incoherent effect.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the point has never been made explicitly— and it seems significant that it occurs to very few theatergoers—how unnatural, how stylized, all stage art is because the actors never stop talking. Every action is overlaid and clothed with words. Even in the first outline, every scene is so planned that the plot shall be unfolded by unceasing conversation. Indeed every preponderance of mere action over the spoken word is regarded as a defect. The spoken word, the most important distinguishing trait of the drama, has developed into a medium of radical purity during the evolution of the art through thousands of years. That this method of presenting an event is not a matter of course will be clearly realized only after seeing from a good silent film how the action proceeds quite easily without any use of words at all.</p>
        <p>Film can make inanimate objects attract attention to themselves. Let us suppose again that in a particular scene on the stage a flower is lying on a table. This flower could never, except with the help of the actors, attract the attention of the audience. The stage director or the playwright cannot rely on the possibility that the audience might in the course of the play notice the insignificant detail because the audience's attention must always be directed to the precise point of the action.</p>
        <p>The film artist has the best possible control of his audience's attention; for by placing the camera just where he wishes he brings onto the screen whatever is of greatest importance at the time, and is able to give proper significance to objects without there being any need for the flower to call out “<span>Now look at me</span>”. The interest of the spectator is necessarily directed to it because at the time he is shown nothing else. Similarly other small events—a fly crawling, or the smoke of a cigarette—which would not be nearly emphatic enough on the stage to draw attention to themselves are given the requisite stress.</p>
        <p>In a film, these little events, these roles played by accessories, are exactly of the same type as the “<span>macroscopic</span>” ones, those represented by the human actors. And hence arises a most satisfactory homogeneity.</p>
        <p>The possibility of rapidly changing the distance from the object leads naturally to a relativization of the standards of size. Insofar as the spectator cannot use his past experience to judge what he sees—insofar as he does not know, for instance, that a fly is objectively small and a mountain large—he has nothing to go on in judging the objective size of what is shown. He has^ no means of knowing how far the camera stood from the object. A newsreel of an architectural exhibition showed several shots of houses that had been erected on the grounds, and immediately afterward, shots of a little plaster model of the city of Rome. To the spectator both sets of buildings appeared of equal size, although in one they were of ordinary height and taken at the necessary distance, and in the other the models were only a few inches high and photographed close to. Experience was here of no use to the spectator in judging the relative sizes.</p>
        <p>This relativization results, on the one hand, in the possibility of making things of quite different sizes appear the same size, and thus of being brought into connection one with another. In a film on German university life the rounded belly of a corps student, who <em>is</em> snoring on a sofa, dissolves into a landscape shot —a similarly formed, gently rounded hill near Heidelberg. These two things which actually are of totally different sizes are simply and easily made to coalesce by the stomach being photographed from close to and the hill from far away; and thereby the opportunity is given of making an amusing comparison between them.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, particular effects may be induced by the spectators being deceived as to the real size of what is shown. A critic once referred to a scene in the film version of Ibsen's A <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Doll's House</em> as a standard example of the idiom of film art. A room is shown, and suddenly a huge hand is put into it, and thereby it is made clear that the room is actually quite small and only part of a doll's house. At first glance the room is assumed to be of normal size, for in the picture itself there is nothing to indicate that anything exceptional—a toy—is involved. The sudden change brought about by perfectly natural means— the normal-sized human hand—brings home the symbolism of the happening to the spectator in the best way. What is only a conceptual identification of the human house and the toy house actually takes place here. Thus once again a “<span>drawback</span>” in film—the impossibility of giving any absolute standard of size— is turned to advantage, and used for artistic effect.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Artistic Use of the Absence of the Space-Time Continuum</h3>
        <p>Unlike real life, film permits of jumps in time and space. Montage means joining together shots of situations that occur at different times and in different places. Theorists, and especially the Russians, have hitherto investigated montage more thoroughly than any other branch of film art.</p>
        <p>It was the Russians who first realized the artistic potentialities of montage; and it was they who first made an attempt to define its principles systematically. At the same time they have often carried their enthusiasm for it too far. They are inclined to consider montage as the only important artistic film feature—as witness their frequently excessive use of it. Indeed the impression is sometimes left that they consider a single uncut strip of film simply a piece of reality—as though an edited film were, so to spealc, cut nature. Pudovkin begins his book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Film Technique</em> with the statement that montage is the foundation of film art. We have tried to show above how even a single shot is in no sense a simple reproduction of nature; how even in the single shot most important differences exist between nature and the film image; and how seriously artistic formative processes must be considered.</p>
        <p>It can be easily seen, however, why montage might be thought of as the royal road to film art. The single image, after all, arises from a recording process, which is controlled by man but which, regarded superficially, does no more than reproduce nature. But when it comes to montage man takes a hand in the process— time is broken up, things that are disconnected in time and space are joined together. This looks much more like a tangibly creative and formative process.</p>
        <p>Pudovkin describes the beginnings of film art as follows: “<span>There was no room for art in the work of the photographer. He photographed the art of the performers. There was of course no question of any special art of film acting, of any particular attributes of film or of methods of approach for the director. What actually was the work of the director in those days? He had the script, which was exactly like a play written for the theater—except that there were no words, and an attempt was made to fill their place with gesture and often lengthy subtitles. The director treated the scene as if it were one on the stage; he arranged entrances and exits, the transitions, and other movements of the actors. He had the whole of such a scene played, while the camera man recorded it in its entirety—the camera simply served to fixate scenes that were complete and finished in themselves</span>”. Montage only arrived with the development of film as an art.</p>
        <p>Montage of an event coherent in time and space must be distinguished from the crosscutting of events that are dissociated from each other. It was with the latter that montage began historically, because it is the less revolutionary process; the different shots were joined to each other, just as different scenes were acted in sequence on the stage. On the stage it had been the custom for hundreds of years to show sequences of scenes that had no connection in time or place. Then came something of which only the rudiments existed on the stage: the scenes were cut up and the various parts mixed in with one another— that is, the action was suddenly interrupted, quite a different scene was played, then this was interrupted and the first continued, then the second again, and so on. The beginnings of this procedure can be found in traditional drama, where, for example, in Shakespearian battle scenes the action often alternated between one camp and the other. In a film the procedure was much easier to use because, instead of having actually to reset the scene on the stage, one scene could follow the next in a smooth rapid sequence.</p>
        <p>It was a much bolder stroke to intervene in one unitary scene, to split up an event, to change the position of the camera in midstream, to bring it nearer, move it farther away, to alter the selection of the subject matter shown. This has up to the present been the most vigorous and stimulating move toward the emancipation of the camera.</p>
        <p>In montage the film artist has a first-class formative instrument, which helps him to emphasize and give greater significance to the actual events that he portrays. From the time continuum of a scene he takes only the parts that interest him, and of the spatial totality of objects and events he picks out only what is relevant. Some details he stresses, others he omits altogether. Examples of this have already been given above.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, too, shots are associated by montage whose connection is not realistic but conceptual or poetic. “<span>I wished to depict joy filmically. Merely to photograph a face registering joy would have been totally ineffective. So I showed the play of the hands and a close-up of the lower half of the face, of the smiling mouth. I cut-in various other material to this; for instance, a shot of a rushing brook in springtime, with dancing sunbeams reflected in the water; of birds splashing in the village pond; and, finally, of a laughing child. I felt I had thus expressed 'The joy of the prisoner</span>”. The artistic fitness of such a sequence is disputable. The scene comes from Pudovkin's <em>Mother</em>. His contempt for the uncut picture, the raw material, is very characteristic—although this attitude is found only in Russian theory and not at all in practice: the Russians understand so well how to choose their material. It is, moreover, very questionable whether the symbolic connection of smile, brook, sunbeams, “<span>happy prisoner</span>” and “<span>joyous child</span>” can add up to visual unity. It has been done thousands of times in poetry; but disconnected themes can easily be joined in language because the mental images attached to words are much vaguer, more abstract and will therefore more readily cohere. Putting actual pictures in juxtaposition, especially in an otherwise realistic film, often appears forced. The unity of the scene, the story of the prisoner who is rejoicing, is suddenly interrupted by something totally different. Comparisons and associations like the brook and the sunbeams are not lightly touched upon in the abstract but are introduced as concrete pieces of nature—and hence are distracting.</p>
        <p>Apart from whether this single instance has been successful or not, the fact remains that the possibility of this kind of montage exists; and one of its distinguishing features is that the shots which follow one another have no space-time connection but only one of substance. It would be quite pointless to inquire whether the brook flows after the face has smiled, or how far from the laughing child are the birds splashing in the water. It is the artist's job to present the material in such a way that the spectators approach it with the correct attitude: they must not be looking for time-space connections. On the other hand, one often finds that unity of place is intended, but that owing to clumsy editing the effect of unity is lost. A man appears and then a second one; and there is nothing to show that these people are supposed to be in the same place. It looks as though the scene had changed to somewhere else and it is impossible to understand what connection there is between the two figures. Since montage separates things that are spatially continuous and joins together things that have no inherent space-time continuity, the danger arises that the process may not be successful and that the whole may disintegrate into pieces, which the spectator cannot combine according to the artist's plan.</p>
        <p>Pudovkin has laid down five methods of montage; but the system does not appear altogether satisfactory logically because the classification refers partly to the manner of cutting and partly to the subject matter, and these two factors are not kept separate.</p>
        <p>1) <em>Contrast</em></p>
        <p>“<span>The miserable state of a starving man is to be shown, for instance. The narrative will make an even greater impression if his condition is contrasted with one of lavish wealth</span>”. (Again the strange distrust of uncut material.) This gives no hint of the technique of cutting—whether the two scenes are to follow entire one upon the other or are to be interlaced piecemeal.</p>
        <p>2) <em>Parallelism</em></p>
        <p> “<span>The method is similar to that of contrast, but it goes much further</span>”. The two different kinds of events are shown alternately by single shots. Obviously, the logical coordination is false. The method of contrast referred to subject matter—the method of parallelism deals with the technique of cutting.</p>
        <p>3) <em>Similarity</em></p>
        <p>“<span>In the finale of <em>Strike</em> by Eisenstein workmen are being shot down and the scene is cut to the slaughter of an ox in a stockyard</span>”. This category once more refers to the content. In principle it does not matter whether interlacing montage or a sequence of whole scenes is used. The first procedure would probably as a rule be more obviously effective.</p>
        <p>4) <em>Synchronism</em></p>
        <p>Two parallel events, related to each other because they occur at the same time. For instance, someone hurries home to rescue his friend, who <em>is</em> led to the scaffold. The interest lies in wondering whether the spatial coincidence will take place soon enough. A third principle is introduced here, to which no reference has been made before. Under none of the preceding headings was anything said about the time connection between the scenes that were cut-in with one another.</p>
        <p>5) <em>Recurrent theme (Leitmotiv)</em></p>
        <p>“<span>If the script writer wishes to stress the basic theme underlying his scenario, the method of reiteration will be of great assistance to him</span>”. The particular scene recurs several times in the same form as a sort of “<span>refrain</span>”—once again referring almost entirely to the content.</p>
        <p>The above is really a bad scheme of classification. Timoshenko, in turn, lays down fifteen principles of montage as follows:</p>
        <p>1) Change of place</p>
        <p>2) Change of position of the camera</p>
        <p>3) Change of range of image</p>
        <p>4) Stressing of details</p>
        <p>5) Analytical montage</p>
        <p>6) Return to past time</p>
        <p>7) Anticipation of the future</p>
        <p>8) Parallel events</p>
        <p>9) Contrast</p>
        <p>10) Association</p>
        <p>11) Concentration</p>
        <p>12) Enlargement</p>
        <p>13) Monodramatic montage</p>
        <p>14) Refrain</p>
        <p>15) Montage</p>
        <p>Since it also it not very satisfactory, this classification will not be discussed further here. It <em>is</em> nothing but an incomplete and unsystematic enumeration of factors, some of which should not be coordinated but subordinated logically.</p>
        <p>In the following, another scheme is attempted, into which the main points of Pudovkin's and Timoshenko's classifications are worked.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Principles of Montage</h3>
        <p>I. <em>Principles of Cutting</em></p>
        <p>A. Length of the cutting unit</p>
        <p>1) Long strips. (The shots that are joined together are all relatively long. Quiet rhythm.)</p>
        <p>2) Short strips. (. . . are all relatively short. Usually employed in cases where the shots themselves are full of rapid action. Climactic scenes. Effect of tumult. Quick rhythm.)</p>
        <p>3) Combination of short and long—into long strips suddenly one or more quite short pieces. Or vice versa. Corresponding rhythm.</p>
        <p>4) Irregular—series of strips of variable length, neither definitely short nor long. The length dependent on the contents. No rhythmic effect.</p>
        <p>B. Montage of whole scenes</p>
        <p>1) Sequential. (An action played straight through to the end. The next joined to it, and so on.)</p>
        <p>2) Interlaced. (The scenes are cut up small and these parts are fitted in with one another. Alternate continuation of one and the other scene. Crosscutting,)</p>
        <p>3) Insertion (of scenes or single frames in a continuous action).</p>
        <p>C. Montage within an individual scene</p>
        <p>1) Combination of long shots and close-ups. (By long shot, which <em>is</em> a relative term, is to be understood one which puts the subject of the close-up in a wider context.)</p>
        <p>a) First a long shot, then one or more details of it as close-ups. (Timoshenko's “<span>concentration</span>”.)</p>
        <p>b) Proceeding from one detail (or several) to a long shot including this detail. (Timo-shenko's “<span>enlargement</span>”) For instance, in the example from Pabst's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Diary of a Lost Girl</em>, first the head of the teacher, then the whole dining room.</p>
        <p>c) Long shots and close-ups in irregular succession.</p>
        <p>2) Succession of detail shots (of which none includes the subject of the others). (Timo-shenko's “<span>analytical montage</span>”.) A whole event or a passing situation composed of nothing but small pieces.  As, in IB, in the combining of whole scenes, so here within the individual scenes, montage may be used for succession, crosscutting, or insertion.</p>
        <p>II. <em>Time Relations</em>.</p>
        <p>A. Synchronism</p>
        <p>1) of several entire scenes (Timoshenko's “<span>parallel events</span>”; Pudovkin's “<span>synchronism</span>”) joined in sequence or crosscut. In sequences usually connected by continuity titles: “<span>While this occurred in X, in Y . . .</span>”</p>
        <p>2) of details of a setting of action at the same moment of time. (Successive showing of events taking place at the same time in the same place. The man is here, the woman there, etc.) (Timoshenko's “<span>analytical montage</span>”.) Unusable.</p>
        <p>B. Before, after</p>
        <p>1) Whole scenes, succeeding each other in time. But also inserted scenes of what has happened (“<span>memory</span>”) or of things that will happen in the future (“<span>prophetic vision</span>”). (Timoshenko's “<span>return to past time</span>” and “<span>anticipation of the future</span>”.)</p>
        <p>2) Succession within a scene. Succession of details which succeed one another in time within the whole action. For example: first shot—he seizes the revolver; second shot—she runs away.</p>
        <p>C. Neutral</p>
        <p>1) Complete actions that are not connected in time but only as regards content. Eisenstein: The shooting of workmen by soldiers cut-in with an ox being slaughtered in a stockyard. Before? After?</p>
        <p>2) Single shots that have no time connection. Rare <em>in</em> narrative films; but, e.g., in Vertovs documentaries.</p>
        <p>3) Inclusion of single shots in a complete scene. For example, Pudovkin's symbolic montage: “<span>joy of the prisoner</span>”. Shots inserted without time connection with the event.</p>
        <p>III. <em>Space Relations</em> </p>
        <p>A. The same place (though different time)</p>
        <p>1) In whole scenes. Someone returns to the same place twenty years later. The two scenes succeeding each other or crosscut.</p>
        <p>2) Within a single scene. “<span>Compressed time</span>”. A leap forward in time so that one sees in unbroken succession what is happening in the same place but actually after a lapse of time. Unusable.</p>
        <p>B. The place changed</p>
        <p>1) Whole scenes. Succession or interlacing of scenes which occur at different places.</p>
        <p>2) Within one scene. Different partial views of the place of action.</p>
        <p>3) Neutral.</p>
        <p>The same as IIC (1-3)</p>
        <p>IV. <em>Relations of Subject Matter</em></p>
        <p>A. Similarity</p>
        <p>1) of shape</p>
        <p>a) of an object. (A round hillock follows on the rounded belly of a student.)</p>
        <p>b) of a movement. (A playground swing in motion follows on the swinging pendulum of a clock.)</p>
        <p>2) of meaning</p>
        <p>a) Single object. (Pudovkin's montage: Laughing prisoner, brook, birds bathing, happy child.)</p>
        <p>b) Whole scene. (Eisenstein: The workmen are shot down, the ox is slaughtered.)</p>
        <p>B. Contrast</p>
        <p>1) of shape</p>
        <p>a) of an object. (First a very fat man, then a thin one.)</p>
        <p>b) of movement. (A slow movement following on a very rapid one.)</p>
        <p>2) of meaning</p>
        <p>a) Single object, (A starving unemployed man; a shop window full of delicious food.)</p>
        <p>b) Whole scene. (In the house of a rich man; in the house of a poor one.)</p>
        <p>C. Combination of similarity and contrast</p>
        <p>1) Similarity of shape and contrast of meaning. (Timoshenko: The feet of a prisoner fettered in a dungeon, and the legs of dancers in a theater. Or: the rich man in an armchair, the rebel in the electric chair.)</p>
        <p>2) Similarity of meaning and contrast of form. (Something of this sort in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Buster Keaton as Sherlock Holmes Junior</em>, He sees a huge picture on the screen of a couple kissing each other, and kisses his girl in the operators box.)</p>
        <p>This scheme is not intended to be exhaustive, and certainly <em>is</em> not so. It <em>is</em> only meant to be a skeleton, to give a general survey.</p>
        <p>The principles under IV may be supplemented by the following remarks: if strips of film are joined one to another, it is often observed, especially with really good montage, that they do not simply stand “<span>additively</span>” beside one another but take on quite different shades of meaning through this juxtaposition. Thus in Eisenstein's scene to which we have already referred the shooting down of the workmen receives a very definite shade of meaning from being combined with the slaughterhouse scene.</p>
        <p>Similarly the purely formal aspect of a picture is often greatly influenced by montage. If the figure of a very tallyman is shown directly after a very short one, this tall man is regarded by the spectator quite otherwise than if he had been shown alone: his height is particularly emphasized by the contrast. This influence may sometimes go so far as to make shots that are placed one after the other appear to be continuous—thus, for instance, the feeling of seeing two separate shots, first of a short man and then a tall one, might be completely lost, and instead the small man be seen to grow tall with a jerk, that is, to shoot upward. If one sees a fat round face and directly afterward a long narrow one, the impression is easily given that the first face has been pulled out and has suddenly grown long and thin. Similar results have been attained in experimental psychology. In his investigation of “<span>illusory movement</span>” Max Wertheimer has described experiments in which he let two illuminated slots, at a small distance from each other, bob up in rapid succession before the eyes of a person in a darkened room. If the distance and the exposure time were correctly chosen, the person had the overwhelming impression that there were not two separate slots lighting up one after the other and beside each other, but that <em>one</em> slot appeared on the left, ran over to the right and was there extinguished.</p>
        <p>This stroboscopic fusion of objectively separate stimuli into one unified impression also occurs in film by montage. In fact, fundamentally, the whole existence of the motion picture is dependent on this principle. For actually, objectively, there is nothing but a succession of single motionless images, phases of motion, on the celluloid strip. It is only because the images succeed one another so rapidly and because they fit one another <em>so</em> exactly that the impression of continuous movement is given. Fundamentally, therefore, film is the montage of single frames—imperceptible montage. Carrying over this principle to the macroscopic, so to speak, results in the above-mentioned effects. If in the first shot a face is shown in profile and in the second full face, the spectator may get the impression that a face has turned toward him.</p>
        <p>Use has already been made of this phenomenon here and there for artistic purposes. There is a well-known scene in Eisenstein's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Battleship Potemkin</em>, which shows a stone lion rearing up and roaring. The scene is made from shots of three different statues of lions. First statue—a lion crouching. Second statue— a lion rising, Third statue—a lion standing with his jaws open to roar. The way the stone comes to life by the help of editing is most remarkable.</p>
        <p>A similar effect is attempted in Karl Junghans' <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Life's Like That</em>. First shot—the statue of a saint with crossed arms. Second shot—a similar statue with arms stretched up to heaven. The effect—with a symbolic meaning—is that the saint is alive and has given a sign.</p>
        <p>This principle leads to tricks of montage, where it is no longer a case of fitting together shots that are unrelated in time and space, but where unity of action is so strong that one does not notice that montage has been employed, and, therefore, perceives the resulting phenomena as actual happenings. If several frames are omitted from a scene showing a man going for a walk, the impression on the spectator is that the man has suddenly with lightning rapidity been picked out of his stride and pushed onward; one does not notice that this effect is achieved merely by joining together disconnected pictures.</p>
        <p>It is perhaps just as well not to designate this process as montage, so as to emphasize that a totally different artistic device is in question than in the methods previously discussed. Montage, in the real sense of the word, requires that the spectator should observe the discrepancy among the shots that are joined together; it is intended to group slices of reality in an integrated whole, whereas the process which was mentioned just now does not unite disconnected things but changes the nature of one continuous action.</p>
        <p>Whereas montage proper does not interfere with the reality material photographed in the picture, the process now under discussion does interfere with it, makes it appear different. Actual events are changed, new realities created. People can be made to appear or disappear suddenly (Chaplin has employed this trick; the French surrealists such as Rene Clair also used it—a inan stretches out a magic wand and the people round him vanish). A sort of accelerated motion can also be achieved; for instance, one scene in the film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Market in Berlin</em> by Wilfried Basse undertakes to show how the booths are built up in the empty square. He achieves his effect very cleverly by joining together shots taken at intervals of half an hour so that one sees the booths springing up by jerks. Within a few seconds the square <em>is</em> magically covered with booths more and more densely until the picture of the market is complete. This method of “<span>imperceptible montage</span>” can, nevertheless, also be used for scenes which do not give such a supernatural effect. It is conceivable that the sudden turning of a person's head, a movement of flight, or something of the same sort, might be more impressively shown by cutting a few frames out of the strip and thus achieving a jerk within the movement. That inanimate things may be made mobile to a certain degree was shown above in the example of the stone lions.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Artistic Use of the Absence of Nonvisual Sense Experiences</h3>
        <p>One of the factors that determine the difference between looking at a motion picture and looking at reality is the absence of the sense of balance and other kinesthetic experiences. In everyday life we always know whether we are looking straight ahead or up or down; we know whether our body is at rest or in motion, and in what kind of motion. But, as was pointed out before, the spectator cannot tell from what angle a film shot has been taken. Hence, unless the subject matter tells him otherwise, he assumes that the camera was at rest and that it was shooting straight. If a moving object appears in the shot, the spectator's first assumption will be that the object is really in motion and not simply that the camera is running past a stationary object. And as far as the space coordinates are concerned, his first idea will always be that what appears at the top of the screen was also on top at the place that was photographed, and not that the camera might have been inclined at an angle. Use is made of relativity of movement, for instance, in those sdenes from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Dr. Mabuse</em> in which, in order to demonstrate the power of the mysterious man, his face appgars small against a dark background, glides forward swiftly, growing larger, until it becomes so huge that it occupies the whole screen. In taking the shot, however, the face was presumably not moved toward the camera, but the camera toward the face. In the Russian film, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">the Shanghai Document</em>, shots of a horse race are seen. The horses and their jockeys are shown galloping over the track, with cuts every now and then to very effective shots of a fluttering flag bearing a racing horse and its rider. The waving of the flag gives the effect of the horse moving; and since the flag (in a close-up) entirely fills the screen, and thus the surroundings do not show that the flag and its horse are actually at rest, it looks as though the horse were galloping and the camera were racing beside it. A subtle (and moreover extremely effective) trick— the illusion of an illusion; for the illusion of standstill which comes of the camera pursuing an actually moving object at the same pace is imitated by a cleverly taken shot of an object that is actually at rest. And the beauty of the idea is that the artifice whereby the spectator is made to feel that the apparently motionless object may be only relatively so, may indeed be actually moving, has not been arbitrarily dragged in but has been achieved in the most natural way by the fluttering of the flag.</p>
        <p>In Murnau's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Four Devils</em> there is a circus scene: A white horse trots steadily round the arena, the camera follows, and so the horse always remains in the middle of the screen and seems almost stationary, because only its body and not its legs are seen; but the whole circle of the auditorium glides past pano-ramically in the background.</p>
        <p>The apparent movement in the shot which is due to the motion of the camera has been very cleverly used by Pabst in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Beggars Opera</em>, in order to emphasize the fantastic and unreal quality of his film.</p>
        <p>The absence of any feeling of the force of gravity also makes a worm's-eye view particularly compelling. If, for instance, a human being is photographed from below, it is of course obvious from the shot that the camera has been directed upward, but this recognition is not quite absorbed by perception—the spectator still feels very strongly that the picture plane is vertical and therefore the figure slanting. The figure appears to be inclined backward; the longitudinal axis of the figure does not appear vertical but oblique, sloping from the bottom front to the top back. Diagram 1 shows the actual circumstances of the case; the human figure (AB) is upright, the camera (CD) inclined at an angle (fig. 1). But as there is nothing to show the spectator that the camera was inclined, he supposes (fig. 2) that CD was upright and therefore sees AB as slanting. This effect helps to make a slanting view very much more striking than it would appear in real life.</p>
        <p>The relativity of the spatial framework could be exploited, as shown in Diagram 2. A man (AB) standing upright, is taken by a camera (CD) directed in the normal horizontal manner (fig. 1); and this photograph is now dissolved into that of a recumbent man who <em>is</em> taken from above (fig. 2). On the screen, the directions in both shots would look alike (fig. 3). A man would be seen, upright and with his head at the top of the screen, though it might appear from the subject matter that the second man was really recumbent. If there were some good reason for it in the plot this might be most effective—for example, fading a soldier on sentry duty into a dead man lying on the ground.</p>
        <p>Thereby, again, a “<span>defect</span>” of photographic technique—the inability to realize the correct space coordinates purely from the appearance of a picture —would have been used to achieve an artistic effect.</p>
        <p>People who did not understand anything of the art of film used to cite silence as one of its most serious drawbacks. These people regard the introduction of sound as an improvement or completion of silent film. This opinion is just as senseless as if the invention of three-dimensional oil painting were hailed as an advance on the hitherto known principles of painting.</p>
        <p>From its very silence film received the impetus as well as the power to achieve excellent artistic effects. Charles Chaplin wrote somewhere that in all his films there was not a single scene where he “<span>spoke</span>”, that is, moved his lips. Hundreds of the most various situations in human relationships are shown in his films, and yet he did not feel the need to make use of such an ordinary faculty as speech. And nobody has missed it. The spoken word in Chaplin's films is as a rule replaced by pantomine. He does not <em>say</em> that he is pleased that some pretty girls are coming to see him, but performs the silent dance, in which two bread rolls stuck on forks act as dancing feet on the table <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(The Gold Rush)</em>. He does not argue, he fights. He avows his love by smiling, swaying his shoulders, and moving his hat. When he is in the pulpit he does not preach in words, but acts the story of David and Goliath (<em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Pilgrim</em>). When he is sorry for a poor girl, he stuffs money into her handbag. He shows renunciation by simply walking away (finale of <em>The Circus)</em>. The incredible visual concreteness of every one of his scenes makes for a great part of Chaplin's art; and this should not be forgotten when it is said—as is often done and of course not without foundation—that his films are not really “<span>filmic</span>” (because his camera serves mainly as a recording machine).</p>
        <p>Mention has already been made of the scene from Sternberg's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Docks of New York</em> in which a revolver shot is illustrated by the rising of a flock of birds. Such an effect is not just a contrivance on the part of a director to deal with the evil of silence by using an indirect visual method of explaining to the audience that there has been a bang. On the contrary, a positive artistic effect results from the paraphrase. Such indirect representation of an event in a material that is strange to it, or giving not the action itself but only its consequences, is a favorite method in all art. To take an example at random: when Francesca da Rimini tells how she fell in love with the man with whom she was in the habit of reading, and only says “<span>We read no more that day</span>”, Dante thereby indicates indirectly, simply by giving the consequences, that on this day they kissed each other. And this indirectness is shockingly impressive.</p>
        <p>In the same way, the rising of the birds is particularly effective, and probably more so than if the actual sound of the pistol shot were heard. And then another factor comes in: the spectator does not simply <em>infer</em> that a shot has been fired, but he actually <em>sees</em> something of the quality of the noise—the suddenness, the abruptness of the rising birds, give visually the exact quality that the shot possesses acoustically. In Jacques Feyder's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Nouveaux Messieurs</em> a political meeting becomes very uproarious, and in order to calm the rising emotions Suzanne puts a coin into a mechanical piano. Immediately the hall is lit up by hundreds of electric bulbs, and now the music chimes in with the agitative speech. The music is not heard: <em>it is</em> a silent film. But Feyder shows the audience excitedly listening to the speaker; and suddenly the faces soften and relax; all the heads begin quite gently to sway in time to the music. The rhythm grows more pronounced until at last the spirit of the dance has seized them all; and they swing their bodies gaily from side to side as if to an unheard word of command. The speaker has to give way to the music. Much more clearly than if the music were actually heard, this shows the power that suddenly unites all these discontented people, puts them into the same merry mood; and indicates as well the character of the music itself, its sway and rhythm. What <em>is</em> particularly noteworthy in such a scene is not merely how easily and cleverly the director makes visible something that is not visual, but by so doing, actually strengthens its effect. If the music were really heard, the spectator might simply realize that music was sounding, but by this indirect method, the particular point, the important part of this music—its rhythm, its power to unite and “<span>move</span>” men—is conspicuously brought out. Only thesfe special attributes of the music are given, and appear as the music itself. Similarly the fact that a pistol shot is sudden, explosive, startling, becomes doubly impressive by transposition into the visible, because only these particular attributes and not the shot itself are given. Thus silent film derives definite artistic (potentialities from its silence. What it wishes particularly to emphasize in an audible occurrence is transposed into something visual; and thus instead of giving the occurrence “<span>itself</span>”, it gives only some of its telling characteristics, and thereby shapes and interprets it.</p>
        <p>Owing to its insubstantiality silent film does not in any way give the effect of being dumb pantomime. Its silence is not noticed, unless the action happens to culminate in something acoustic for which nothing can be substituted, and which is therefore felt as missing—or unless one is accustomed to sound film. Because of sound film, in the future it will be possible only with great difficulty to show speech in a silent way. Yet this is a most effective artistic device. For if a man is heard speaking, his gestures and facial expression only appear as an accompaniment to underline the sense of what is said. But if one does not hear what is said, the meaning becomes indirectly clear and is artistically interpreted by muscles of the face, of the limbs, of the body. The emotional quality of the conversation is made obvious with a clarity and defi-niteness which are hardly possible in the medium of actual speech. Moreover, the divergence between reality and dumb show gives the actor and his director plenty of leeway for artistic invention. (The creative power of the artist can only come into play where reality and the medium of representation do not coincide.)</p>
        <p>Dialogue in silent film is not simply the visible part of a real spoken dialogue. If a real dialogue is shown without the sound, the spectator will often fail to grasp what it is all about; he will find the facial expression and the gestures unintelligible. In silent film, the lips are no longer word-forming physical organs but a means of visual expression—the distortion of an excited mouth or the fast chatter of lips are not mere by-products of talking; they are communications in their own right. Silent laughter is often more effective than if the sound is actually heard. The gaping of the open mouth gives a vivid, highly artistic interpretation of the phenomenon “<span>laughter</span>”. If, however, the sound is also heard, the opening of the mouth appears obvious and its value as a means of expression is almost entirely lost. This opportunity of the silent film was once used by the Russians in a most unusual and effective manner. A shot of a soldier who had gone mad in the course of a battle and was laughing hideously with his mouth wide open was joined with a shot of the body of a soldier who had died of poison gas, and whose mouth was fixed in death in a ghastly, rigid grin.</p>
        <p>The absence of the spoken word concentrates the spectator's attention more closely on the visible aspect of behavior, and thus the whole event draws particular interest to itself. Hence it <em>is</em> that very ordinary shots are often so impressive in silent films—such as a documentary shot of an itinerant hawker crying his wares with grandiose gestures. If his words could be heard the effect of the gestures would not be half as great, and the whole episode might attract very little attention. If, however, the words are omitted, the spectator surrenders entirely to the expressive power of the gestures. Thus by merely robbing the real event of something—the sound—the appeal of such an episode is greatly heightened.</p>
        <p>Except for such a highly gesticulatory figure as the hawker, a dialogue taken straight from real life seldom conveys much in silent film. One can extract from such a strip distinctive little parts such as are to be found in practically every dialogue, but even this process of selection only leads to accidental success, Hence, too, the difficulty of many stage players to adapt themselves to the technique of silent film; and also the fact that certain techniques which actors acquire in film work look embarrassing on the stage.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Other Capacities of Film Technique</h3>
        <p>1) <em>The Mobile Camera</em></p>
        <p>Hitherto we have discussed chiefly the fixed camera. But it is welT known that the camera can be placed on a truck, or slide along a cable, or be tilted and rotated for “<span>panning</span>”. The subject of the shot increases in size when the.camera approaches it, and at the same time the range of the field is diminished. This makes possible an unbroken change from a long shot to a close-up, and vice versa, without any necessity for montage.</p>
        <p>The moving camera is especially useful when the scene of action is not an immobile setting, in which the actors come and go, but the actors are, as it were, the constant setting while the surroundings vary. The camera may accompany the hero through all the rooms of a house, down the stairs, along the street; and the human figure may always remain the same, while the surroundings pass as a panorama, continually changing. The film artist is thereby able to do what is very hard for the theater director, namely, to show the world from the standpoint of an individual, to take man as the center of his cosmos—that is, to make a very subjective experience accessible to the eyes of all.</p>
        <p>Indeed, experiences of an even more subjective nature may be represented in this manner. How “<span>everything seems to turn round</span>” someone, feelings of giddiness, vertigo, intoxication, falling, rising—all these are easily produced by the appropriate motions of the camera.</p>
        <p>2) <em>Backward Motion</em></p>
        <p>We are still at an experimental stage in the use of such film devices as are of no particular advantage in a straightforward narrative film, but which because they are so radically divergent from nature should have great potentialities for the artist who does not wish slavishly to copy reality. Hitherto almost everything to which we have referred in the way of formal devices, from the choice of the camera angle to <em>montage</em>, is or can be used to give the spectator an image of the world as he knows it, even though it may be artistically selected and shaped. We shall now discuss certain artifices by means of which reality may be interpreted, but which do not result in images that are superficially realistic. With a revolving camera the spectator may be made to feel that if he were drunk he would see the world swaying in such a manner. But if he sees a shot in which people, motorcars, and everything move backward, all illusion of reality is lost. Since nowadays the film artist generally speaking is not allowed to carry his formative ideas beyond the point at which the average spectator might be prevented from thinking that he <em>is</em> watching “<span>real</span>” events, these admirable camera devices, which do not conform to realism, remain neglected.</p>
        <p>Except for short humorous episodes in newsreels, little use has been found for backward motion. The potentialities are almost completely untried. For instance, in order to portray a particular manner in which a man enters a room, the director might take a backward motion shot of the actor walking backward out of the room—thus making him walk forward by reversing his walking backward. A hauntingly strange effect is likely to result. Moreover, tricks can be played on the force of gravity. I remember a scene somewhere in which an acrobat floated straight up in the air on the end of a parachute. The parachute gradually folded itself up into a compact little parcel, and the man swung neatly up into the airplane. It was backwarcicmotion, of course. Fragments joining up to form an unbroken pot; variations in facial expression shown backward—all these things have at most been tried occasionally as a joke, but have not yet been seriously used by artists. If one tries to visualize these possibilities, one gets an inkling of how very near we still are to the beginnings, and of how much we should lose if on economic or any other grounds the further evolution of film art were prevented.</p>
        <p>It must be realized that the artistic film (that is, film which is produced without regard for the general public) will very soon reach a stage when quite exclusive films will be created, for which there will not be the smallest chance of popular success. Not that there will not always be plenty of naturalistic films; but in addition—if the businessmen will allow it— simply because the potentialities within an art medium create the urge to use them, whimsical, fantastic products will appear, compared with which the wildest futurism of the twenties will seem like innocuous ornaments.</p>
        <p>3) <em>Accelerated Motion</em></p>
        <p>If a strip of negative is exposed in the camera at a slower speed than it is afterward projected, time appears compressed in the performance, the movement quickened. This accelerating effect has been used, for example, to express the speed of modern traffic— cars flash through the streets, people dash about in and out among each other in long snaky lines with astonishing suppleness and smoothness, and the leaves on the trees flap restlessly. This trick has occasionally been used by artists. Eisenstein, for instance, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The General Line</em>, shows an office with the work going on appallingly slowly. Then suddenly someone crashes his fist on the table and raises Cain—and at once everything goes on at lightning speed. The clerks fly through the room, papers are signed and stamped as if by magic, and everything <em>is</em> finished off in a twinkling.</p>
        <p>But acceleration can also be used for totally different purposes. In taking the shots for the I. G. Farben film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Miracle of Flowers</em>, which consisted of nothing but accelerated pictures of plants and is certainly the most fantastic, thrilling, and beautiful film ever made—in taking these shots it was shown that plants have expressive gestures, which we do not see because they are too slow for our minds but which become visible in accelerated pictures. The swaying, rhythmic breathing motions of the leaves, the excited dance of the leaves around the blossom, the almost voluptuous abandon with which the flower opens—the plants all at once come alive and show that they use expressive gestures exactly like those to which we are accustomed in men and animals. Watching a climbing plant anxiously groping, uncertainly seeking a hold, as its tendrils twine about a trellis, or a fading cactus bloom bowing its head and collapsing almost with a sigh, was an uncanny discovery of a new living world in a sphere in which one had of course always admitted life existed but had never been able to see it in action. Plants were suddenly and visibly enrolled in the ranks of living beings. One saw that the same principles applied to everything, the same code of behavior, the same difficulties, the same desires.</p>
        <p>This of course was a lucky strike, and not much more <em>is</em> to be expected in this line. Nevertheless, it <em>is</em> always possible that equally exciting revelations may be in store concerning the behavior of inorganic matter. Occasional discoveries of this sort have already been made, as, for example, in the very curious accelerated films of the growth of crystals or of frost patterns on window panes.</p>
        <p>Naturally such a device is usable for the artist. The Russians have shown how even completely abstract shots may be cut into quite naturalistic narrative films—such as the sudden gleam of a light or an indefinable, immaterial drizzle. These curious shots can, therefore, at least be used as stuff for montage. But why should not, even in the middle of a narrative film, a flower suddenly begin to wave its leaves wildly or put forth blossoms? (Jean Renoir's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Little Match Girl</em> contains a picture in accelerated motion of roses bursting into bloom, though in this case there is no particular justification.)</p>
        <p>4)<em> Slow Motion</em></p>
        <p>If the negative <em>is</em> exposed in the camera more rapidly than when the print is projected at the performance, the movement is slowed down to a fraction of the natural speed so that hundreds of frames are exposed in a second. This has hitherto been used almost exclusively in educational films in order to show the individual phases of rapid movements. In this way the technique of a boxer or of a violinist, the explosion of a bomb, the jump of a dog, can be analyzed closely. Slow motion has hardly been applied at all yet to artistic purposes, although it should be very useful. It might, for instance, serve to slow down natural movements grotesquely; but it can also create new movements, which do not appear as the retarding of natural movements but have a curious gliding, floating character of their own. Slow motion should be a wonderful medium for showing visions and ghosts.</p>
        <p>Experiments ought to be made with slow motion just as with acceleration in order to find out how the expression of the human face and body appears when it is thus retarded and whether the result would not make for good montage material. What does a slow-motionJpicture of a face registering sudden terror or joy look like? Here again effects would be attainable which the spectator would not take for slowed-down versions of actually faster movements but accept as “<span>originals</span>” in their own right. (Apparently artists are experimenting with the use of slow motion. And once again Pudovkin is the pioneer. According to a newspaper report he is using slow motion in his new film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The World Is Beautiful</em> for such things as allowing a child's smile to develop slowly in a close-up.)</p>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Entr'acte</em>, a surrealist film, a hearse is shown running away from the funeral procession. The hearse dashes through the streets and the mourners run after it in slow motion. Their legs are raised very slowly as though they cjlung to the ground and their arms swing backward and forward with ghastly deliberation. Here again, an irresistibly comic effect is achieved because one does not feel that one is seeing a retardation of normal runnirjg but a stylized take-off.</p>
        <p>5) <em>Still Photographs</em></p>
        <p>Ordinary stationary photography is not as fundamentally remote from film as might be supposed. Still photographs may be used for other purposes besides the illustrated magazines and the showcases of movie palaces. A still photograph inserted in the middle of a moving film gives a very curious sensation; chiefly because the time character of the moving shots <em>is</em> carried over to the still picture, which therefore looks uncannily petrified. An ordinary photograph hardly ever gives an impression of rigid standstill because the dimension of motion <em>is</em> not applied to it, and the time spent looking at it is not considered as being the time that passes while the event shown in the picture takes place. But a still photograph cut into a film acts like the curse on Lot's wife. In the film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">People on Sundays</em> (Film Studio 1929) a beach photographer is shown at work. Various people of whom he takes pictures appear, half-length, each first moving in the film, and then cut-in suddenly as “<span>portrait</span>”. A smiling, naturally moving person is suddenly petrified as if touched by a magic wand, and persists for whole seconds in an oppressive immobility.</p>
        <p>The particular effect produced by cutting-in a still picture cannot be made simply by the actor suddenly arresting a motion and holding it. Firstly, there is an astonishing difference between such voluntary cessation of motion and the absolute rigidity of a photograph; and, secondly, an actor can hardly hold the absurd momentary phases caught by a still photograph, which <em>is</em> not dependent upon the will of the actor and the laws of physical motion.</p>
        <p>6) <em>Fading in, Fading out, Dissolving</em></p>
        <p>Sometimes in order to avoid sudden appearance a picture is allowed to grow slowly out of the darkness, or to disappear in the same way. Fading in and fading out can be used to show people's subjective perception; for instance, when a person <em>is</em> waking up or falling asleep. But above all, it <em>is</em> a good means of keeping one scene distinct from the next; for since shots that follow immediately on one another usually appear as part of an unbroken time sequence, it is often not easy to show that an episode has come to an end, and that the scene of action is changing. If, however, the scene is fadedjout, the spectator feels that there is a break as though a curtain had dropped, and when something else fades in a new scene is expected.</p>
        <p><em>Dissolving</em> means the gradual transmuting of one shot into another. The two are not simply joined side by side by ordinary montage, but while the first shot becomes gradually fainter, the second begins indistinctly to appear, and by degrees gets stronger until it completely obliterates the first. Dissolving serves, like fading in and out, to mark a break between two scenes; it destroys the illusion of an unbroken passage of time and of one fixed place, because it presents a visible superimposition of times and places, and only separate things can be superimposed on one another, not things that follow one another in time or are immediately next to each other in space. Dissolving is a visible relative displacement of the coordinates of time (or space) and therefore impossible within a scene in whichjthe unities of space and time are unbroken.</p>
        <p>Dissolving often helps to heighten the effects of contrast and similarity in montage, for the more simply and easily one shot melts into another, the more striking it is if a connection of subject (similarity or contrast) between the two is suddenly noticed; and the more strongly <em>is</em> the connection emphasized. Two shots that are combined on the principle of similarity can be so dissolved into each other that the vague, indeterminate, neutral zone shows abstractly what is common to both shots: for instance, the “<span>swinging</span>” as such of a pendulum and of a playground swing.</p>
        <p>7) <em>Superimposition, Simultaneous Montage</em></p>
        <p>From the dissolve there is only a step to showing several shots simultaneously. This has the same effect, but in a higher degree, as exposing the same plate twice over in ordinary photography. It is a good means of depicting confusion and chaos. Attempts have often been made to give the feeling of the medley and bustle of street traffic by showing various shots one on top of the other.</p>
        <p>Quite other effects may, however, be achieved by this device. In the scene mentioned above from Feyder's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Nouveaux Messieurs</em>, the interplay of the orator and the mechanical piano is shown. Feyder superimposes a close-up of the speaker, gesticulating despairingly in the direction of the noise, upon a close-up of the drum inside the mechanical piano—the drumstick is seen moving up and down, and in the double picture it not only hits the drum but also the speakers head. Thus the conflict that is only acoustic and narrative is transposed into the realm of the visual. And this has been done by artificially superimposing two episodes which in reality were taking place in the same space, but could not be brought into a visual association that would express the required connection. A certain aesthetic objection to the process is contained in the word “<span>artificial</span>” The commotion of a dance has also been shown by superimposition of dancers and the band. If these shots were simply put one after the other in ordinary montage it is fairly certain that they would make no more impression on the audience than simply indicating that the director wished to show that here is a band and here are people dancing. But superimposition is a simple way of showing the abstract substance of all otrthese scenes; that is, their meaning and mood rather than merely the events.</p>
        <p>The method is convenient but somewhat artificial. This is obvious if it is compared with the effects of the selection of the camera angle which was discussed above. It was shown there how a particular connection between objects or events could be induced by optical juxtaposition or superimposition without interfering with reality, simply by a careful selection as regards kind and position of the objects in question, and then by choosing a camera angle which would make the required connection clear without the real spatial relationships in the scene being artificially changed or destroyed entirely. Example; the perspective super-imposition of t)ie convict and the prison bars. It must be admitted that in a naturalistic narrative film a superimposition by double exposure may easily give the impression of a foreign body, which interferes with the style of the rest; and, secondly, that the artistic effect of a scene is greater if it interprets and molds the material without doing violence to it. It <em>is</em> more striking, and more elegant. The abstract meaning which the artist brings into his production by the studied adaptation of visual devices should not appear as something external, arbitrarily introduced, but <em>is</em> much more effective if it <em>is</em> achieved simply by appropriate grouping and viewing of the material at hand. Multiple exposure <em>is</em> likely to give the feeling that the artist has achieved his effect too cheaply, and in too superficial a manner.</p>
        <p>To be used and assessed in much the same way as superimposition is simultaneous montage—by which <em>is</em> meant montage of scenes juxtaposed within one image. Its first application was in the artistically suspect method by which memories and forebodings used to be shown: The hero is sitting deep in thought, and suddenly what he is thinking of appears as a circular insert in a corner at the top of the screen. This procedure is poor because the road from the idea to the visual form is too direct. “<span>A man is thinking of his wife</span>”—is primarily an abstract theme and difficult to render visibly unless it is in some way made concrete. A device may be adopted—the man may look at his wife's picture—and the situation is clear. Such a device is not original, but the abstract is thereby made sufficiently concrete. The artifice of simultaneous montage means an evasion of the effort to find an actual situation which will make the abstract part of the scene clear to the eyes of the audience without constraint. Two conceptually related items are simply placed side by side visually as well and thus a comprehensible pictorial representation of the theme is given—but by an artless, artificial method. Something of this kind has characterized most of the experiments that have been made with simultaneous montage. In Eisenstein's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The General Line</em>, where the vision of a gigantic stud bull suddenly appears over the cows, one has the feeling that—compared with his other inventions within the bounds of naturalistic style—the artist has made things too easy for himself, and in approaching the problem has considered the theme too much and the picture too little. It is true, however, that since the shot in question is definitely symbolic, there <em>is</em> less need of unifying it with the style of the rest.</p>
        <p>Simultaneous montage is more impressive when it is meaningful not only in content but also in form. Thus Vertov^has sometimes shown two or three images of the same scene on top of each other—the same machine, for instance, has driven across the screen three times—and from this a sort of symmetrical design has arisen which is not ineffective.</p>
        <p>In the examples that have been discussed up to the present, simultaneous montage was so used that it could at once be recognized as such by the spectator, that is, so that the picture was bound to strike him as being a compound. Such amalgamations may, however, also be used to produce the illusion of a reality which does not exist. The same object may be present twice; a man may talk to himself. For this purpose separate shots are taken and are afterward so skillfully put together that it; is impossible to detect the join. The device has enabled star players to shine in two parts at once. There was a great sensation when Henny Porten as a clumsy maidservant talked to Henny Porten the elegant Ikdy—(Fancy! she can not only play any kind of a part, but she can do them all at once!) Artistic use of the wraith was made in Conrad Veidt's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Student of Prague</em> and in Friedrich Ermler's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fragment of an Empire</em>. A symbolic battle scene occurs in the latter film: a German soldier and a Russian attack each other with bayonets. There is a sudden close-up—and it is seen that they both have the same face (both are being played by the same actor). They recognize each other and drop their bayonets. The generals in the German and Russian headquarters im-potently rage, and order the renewal of the battle, but the officers to whom they give their orders again have the same face as the two soldiers. The folly of war that forces “<span>Man</span>” to turn on himself in a different uniform—the paradox has hardly ever been put quite so impressively. “<span>All men have something in common, a certain kinship</span>”—this abstract idea is made concrete by the creation of an artificial reality in which this common bond is made visible. Men all have the same face, and the fact that their uniforms are different seems futile and absurd in comparison with the surprisingly revealed visible truth.</p>
        <p>8) <em>Special Lenses</em></p>
        <p>A multiplication of one and the same object can, apart from montage, also be achieved directly at the time the picture is shot by specially cut lenses, the insertion of prisms, and other means. Nevertheless the potentialities of these means do not seem to be very great. The same face may be multiplied a hundredfold, it may be distorted—but these are after all very special and rigid effects, which allow little variation and therefore must soon come to seem conventional and stale, Thus Granowsky in his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Song of Life</em> shows champagne glasses, infants, and skulls, in symbolic multiplication. This trick appears stereotyped, too mechanical, and easily degenerates into the ridiculous.</p>
        <p>Charlie Chaplin managed to achieve unexpected and amusing effects by multiplying one man without the benefit of montage or special lenses in his mirror-labyrinth scene in <em>The Circus</em>.</p>
        <p>9) <em>Manipulation of Focus</em></p>
        <p>In the old days any picture that was out of focus was simply considered a mistake. But as with so many other supposed shortcomings photography has learned to utilize it for particular purposes. At first the device was used, like fading in and out, to cause a picture to appear or disappear gradually. Sometimes it is the very uncertainty or incomprehensibility of the hazy picture that makes it attractive—it is impossible to guess what is coming, all kinds of speculations can be indulged in, and then suddenly the picture grows distinct, and everything is cleared up. In Eisenstein's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The General Line</em> the first appearance of the mysterious machine round which the plot revolves—the centrifugal milk separator—is made especially exciting, quite in accordance with the story, by the fact that the first close-up, which is to show the marvel clearly for the first time, begins out of focus. One sees a confused glittering of^ lights—the highlights on the polished aluminum surface of the machine, as is proved when the picture grows clear and the machine suddenly comes into focus as though out of a fog.</p>
        <p>Moreover,^kidistinctness serves to give the subjective impression of hazy vision like that of a drunken man or someone awakening from anesthesia. It may even be used like a close-up to bring out details when the picture extends far into depth: since the range of focus of the camera <em>is</em> limited, the foreground and the background can be shown alternately by varying the focus, thus indicating, for example, a dialogue between someone standing near the front and someone farther back. The audience is compelled to look first at one figure, then the other, as the director chooses.</p>
        <p>10) <em>Mirror Images</em></p>
        <p>Finally, instead of the real object, its image in some reflecting material may be photographed. This is especially effective if the spectator is not at first conscious of the trick, but supposes himself to be looking at a normal picture showing the actual object. For instance, a photograph might be taken of the reflection of a man in an absolutely still sheet of water; and since the spectator could neither tell that the camera had been turned upside down nor that he was looking at a reflection instead of the reality, he might believe he was seeing a normal picture. Then the water might suddenly become agitated; the picture would waver, be distorted, become unrecognizable. Such a scene might be used, even if no water occurred in the film, simply as a means of showing the dissolution of a man of flesh and blood into a quavering caricature, or to depict hallucinations (cf. the dream images in Gra-nowsky's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Song of Life)</em>. The object might also be photographed in a looking glass. The spectator thinks he <em>is</em> watching the physical objects themselves, he follows the plot, and suddenly a stone is hurled into the picture, the glass is splintered; reality—as far as the spectator is concerned—is shattered. It would result in a very powerful visual shock.</p>
        <p>In the same way all kinds of distorting mirrors can be used; and again, if the device is applied at all skillfully, the spectator will not at first notice that it is only a mirror that has been photographed, and will therefore accept the distortion as the real thing.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Summary of the Formative Means of Camera and Film Strip</h3>
        <p>Challenged by the favorite argument of people who dislikerfilnfr—that it is nothing but the mechanical reproduction of nature and therefore not art—we have examined in detail the various aspects of filmic representation and have found that even at the most elementary level there are significant divergences between the image that the camera makes of reality and that which the human eye sees. We found, moreover, that such differences not only exist, but that they can be used to mold reahty for artistic purposes. In other words, that what might be called the “<span>drawbacks</span>” of film technique (and which engineers are doing their best to “<span>overcome</span>”) actually form the tools of the creative artist.</p>
        <p>For the sake of emphasis and clearness, a short summary o^the characteristics of the film medium and their application is appended.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Every Object Must be Photographed From One Particular Viewpoint.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Applications</em>.</p>
        <p>a) View that shows the shape of the object most characteristically.</p>
        <p>b) View that conveys a particular conception of the object (e.g., worm's-eye view, indicating weight and forcefulness).</p>
        <p>c) View that attracts the spectator's attention by being unusual.</p>
        <p>d) Surprise effect due to the concealment of the back side (Chaplin sobbing; no!—mixing a cocktail!)</p>
        <p><strong>2. Objects Are Put Behind Or Beside One Another By Perspective.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Applications</em>. </p>
        <p>a) Unimportant objects are hidden by being wholly or partly covered; important objects are thereby emphasized.</p>
        <p>b) Surprise effect by the sudden revealing of what had been concealed by something else.</p>

        <p>Destroying, distorting an object (or the “<span>world</span>”).</p>
        <p>Even without going into the question of what the camera photographs—that is, what objects are selected, what sort of events and setting, how the actors are made up, and so forth—we have seen what unlimited possibilities of molding and transforming nature are contained in the properties of the film medium itself. The film artist chooses a particular scene that he wishes to photograph. Within this scene he can leave out objects, cover them up, make them prominent, and yet not interfere with reality. He can increase or decrease the size of things, can make small objects larger than big ones, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>He can put beside, behind, among one another, things that are entirely separate in space and time. He can pick out what is important, however small and inconspicuous it may be, and thus let the part represent the whole. He can lay down what is upright, and set upright what is recumbent, can move what stands still, and arrest what is moving. He eliminates entire areas of sensory perception, and thereby brings others into higher relief, ingeniously making them take the place of those that are missing. He can let the dumb speak and thereby interpret the sphere of sound.</p>
        <p>He shows the world not only as it appears objectively but also subjectively. He creates new realities, in whicii things can be multiplied, turns their movements and actions backward, distorts them, retards or accelerates them. He calls into existence magical worlds where the force of gravity disappears, mysterious powers move inanimate objects, and broken things are made whole. He brings into being symbolic bridges between events and objects that have had no connection in reality. He intervenes in the structure of nature to make quivering, disintegrate ghosts of concrete bodies and spaces. He arrests the progress of the world and of things, and changes them to stone. He breathes life into stone and bids it move. Of chaotic and illimitable space he creates pictures beautiful in fc-rm and of profound significance, as subjective and complex as painting.=</p>
        <p>It must be admitted that most film directors do not make much original use of the artistic means at their disposal. ttfiey do not produce works of art but tell the people stories. They and their employers and audiences are not concerned with form but with content. Nevertheless there are plenty of examples to show that film is capable of better things; not a great many first-rate works of art, complete, coherent, and highly finished—the art is still too young for that, it <em>is</em> still too much in the experimental stage—but there are nevertheless enough films that show in individual scenes, individual inventions, in the efforts of individual actors, what might be, what still lies hidden and untapped. And there is, in art, nothing to prevent one's clinging to the little that is good, instead of the great quantity that is bad.</p>
        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em>3 The Content of the Film</em></h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Mind Through the Body</h3>
        <p>The raw material that the film can use for its representations consists entirely of material objects and physical happenings. But mental processes may be expressed by means of these. There are, above all, the play of the human face and the gestures of the body and limbs—by means of them human thought and feeling are expressed in the most direct and familiar way. These are, however, not the only means of making inner happenings externally visible, and perhaps not even the best and most effective.</p>
        <p>Since most people are not in the habit of observing their fellow men in everyday life to see how far their gestures are vivid and significant, it seldom occurs to them how unnatural and exaggerated are those of most film actors. The “<span>natural acting</span>” of everyday life is curious. It is most ambiguous and indeterminate, enigmatic and individual. Many people are sparing of it, and its use is monotonous, being confined to a very few muscles. A man's facial expression often does not seem to the average beholder in the least indicative of his mental state. Some people look as if they were laughing when they are crying, and some people's smiles are very acid. And, above all, much everyday expression fails to convey a well-defined meaning: it is not striking, one does not know how to interpret it, it may mean resignation or doubt or stupidity or reserve. The face is contorted and full of wrinkles, but the whole effect is not quite harmonious, it does not convey a homogeneous message. Much facial ex-pressionfis comprehensibile only because it is a part of a situation, because the conversation and various other indications reveal what the man is feeling. It is only in this way that the untidy play of lines in his face is understood as meaning embarrassment or greed or pleasure.</p>
        <p>The expression of animals and primitive peoples, though for reasons of our own upbringing difficult for us to understand, is intrinsically much more distinct. That it has degenerated to such an extent in civilized man is due to several causes. All our social customs tend to the impoverishment of external expression because it is considered improper in human intercourse to^ manifest personal desires and feelings unrestrainedly. If one observes a mother with her child, one notices her to systematically break the child of its natural gesture of face and limbs (“<span>Don't stare at the gentleniman like that!</span>”—“<span>Sit still!</span>”) Again, modern man is not so direct in his thoughts and feelings as primitive man and the animals. The variety of his motives, the suppleness and flexibility of thought, the lightning rapidity of the clash of tiny impulses and repressions, all have their natural echo in the play of features and in gestures; and so has the fact that this variety of stirrings often is not integrated in a clear-cut whole.</p>
        <p>In a good work of art, however, everything must be clear—if anything indistinct is to be shown, it must be distinctly indistinct—and therefore human expression on the screen must be plain and unmistakable.</p>
        <p>Hence a film actor must be capable of producing “<span>pure</span>” expression. His face, for example, must be so constituted that the required expression emerges quite clearly down to the smallest details. That an actor does not “<span>get across</span>”, <em>is</em> often because he cannot make each individual muscle fit in with what is required. He may have an indefinite, weak mouth, which refuses to stiffen up with the rest of the face when he is supposed to register strong-mindedness; or a nervous tension of the eyebrows, which he cannot relax even when the face is supposed to be expressing placid cheerfulness.</p>
        <p>Why does the “<span>pure</span>” acting of the movies not seem unnatural to the audience, who, after all, are accustomed in real life to people whose expression is more or less indistinct? Most people's perception in these matters <em>is</em>, as I said, not very acute. They are not in the habit of observing closely the play of features of their fellow men—either in real life or at the movies. They are satisfied with grasping the meaning of what they see. Thus, in fact, they often take in the overemphasized—sometimes highly conventional and unnatural—expression of film actors more easily than any that is too naturalistic. And as far as lovers of art are concerned, they do not look at the movies for imitations of nature but for art. They know that artistic representation is always explaining, refining, making clear the object depicted. Things that in real life are imperfectly realized, merely hinted at, and entangled with other things appear in a work of art complete, entire and clearly, free from extraneous matters. This is also true of acting in film.</p>
        <p>The stylizing of acting must, nevertheless, remain within strict limits. In a narrative film, that <em>is</em>, a “<span>naturalistic</span>” film, a point is soon reached at which the shaping of expression turns into crude artificiality. It is, of jeourse, understandable that a medium so strongly dependent upon the visible—particularly in the case of the silent film—will easily induce the actor and the director to give strong prominence to facial expression and gesture. Slapstick shows with especial clearness how very suitable to film is this exaggerated play of feature and limb. But in “<span>naturalistic</span>” film care must be exercised. Any artistic medium tempts the artist to do violence to nature; and although it is fitting for the artist to submit to the conditions of his medium, it is on the other hand essential that he should not let himself be led into being unfaithful to nature.</p>
        <p>The average movie actor has developed a technique of expression to which the spectator easily grows accustomed because it <em>is</em> in a certain sense very “<span>filmic</span>”. It must, nevertheless, be rejected as inartistic, especially since it also serves as a cheap trick to translate any desired mebtal state into a language of visual stereotypes. When the actor's chest heaves visibly, it is clear to everyone that agitation is intended. This up-and-down movement is also pictorially very satisfactory and effective, but the outrage to nature is usually too violent for such an interpretation to be admitted as “<span>natural</span>”. The acting is not only unpleasantly amplified, but every thought, every emotion is simply translated into the visible, regardless of the fact that by no means everything a man thinks and feels is obvious in his face and gestures. A language of signs has been developed which is already nearly as void as if instead a title were inserted to this effect: “<span>Erwin is terribly upset by this news</span>”. Certainly sound film by the introduction of speech appears to beneficially reduce this function of acting.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, however, good actors and directors have shown that the best effects are almost always achieved by “<span>acting</span>” as little as possible. The great actors work with very slight expenditure of muscular energy, they achieve a substantial effect by their very presence. Stage actors, who are obliged on account of the poor optical conditions of the theater to play everything with overstatement, are accustomed to exaggerated effects. This technique, however, soon proved to be unsuitable and superfluous for film use, since the most insignificant gesture can be seen quite clearly owing to the enormous enlargement of the picture when it is thrown on the screen. The development—especially under Russian influence—has been toward an increased restriction of the play of feature and toward using the actor as one of the “<span>properties</span>” chosen for his typicalness and allowed to make his effect simply by his presence, by being introduced in the proper context. For this of course a well-constructed script is necessary. If the actor does not “<span>act</span>”, his mental state must be made perfectly clear at every moment by what is going on around him—even if he is doing nothing but staring straight ahead. This development may possibly lead to the employment of fewer actors and an increasing number of chance comers who happen to be the right type—as has already happened in Russia. For if the film continues to develop a style that reduces the contribution of acting by expressing meaning through photogenic narration (in the script) and the devices of the camera, man will eventually be one “<span>prop</span>” among many, and like a dog or a teapot be required to furnish little but his appearance and presence. For this purpose “<span>real</span>” types arerbetter than make-believe; a real insurance salesman, policeman, cobbler, furniture mover, better than extras made up to look like them—that <em>is</em> unquestionable. The actor is only necessary when “<span>acting</span>” is required; hence amateurs, real types, are useless for the theater.</p>
        <p>It will be obvious from this that “<span>acting</span>” is not the only means of expressing mental states in a film. (It is proposed to leave aside the expressive value of the spoken word here, especially as nearly all that can be said about it applies not only to talkies but also to the theater.) And that is very important, for if film were dependent upon such acting for the expression of human strivings the expression of the body would soon be blunted as an instrument—it would still be understood, but the audience would no longer be moved by it. It may be reasonable to assert that an actor can never achieve the same depth of artistry in a silent film as on the stage for the material at his disposal—the mere expression of face and gesture without the interpretation of spoken words—is too primitive. If an actor has to declaim one of Shakespeare's great monologues, he has every opportunity of making it into a great artistic achievement all by himself. But it would be unfair to expect him to rise to equally great heights if he were allowed to use nothing but silent play. A silent film may be as profound as a Shakespearian drama; but the “<span>dumb action</span>” of a player can never be as profound as Hamlet's monologue.</p>
        <p>It will be understood that I am arguing not against the silent film but against film relying heavily upon silent “<span>acting</span>” in the conventional sense. What other means, then, are available by which mental states may be represented? Here is an elementary example: Everyone knows that favorite theme, the tragic clown, such as the one in Sjostrom's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">He Who Gets Slapped</em>, where a scientist who has fallen on bad times becomes a clown. His face has been painted into a thick chalky horror. Nothing of the actor's face can be seen through this mask, and yet the spectator feels most vividly the agony of the humiliated creature simply because he knows what the man was like before, and hence what he must be feeling now. Without the actor's assisting in any way, the state of mind of the figure which he embodies is thus clearly realized by everyone; for the plot of the whole film is so constructed that the psychology of this scene is unmistakable. A similar example is Professor Unrath in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Blue Angel</em>.</p>
        <p>In this way the role of the actor may be reduced to his simply appearing. But the actor can also express mental states by what he does, and yet abandon “<span>expressive</span>” acting almost entirely. De Mille's film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chicago</em> contains shots of the public galleries in a law court where a sensational case is being tried. There is a close-up of a bench full of girls who are following the case absorbedly with wide-open eyes, and at the same time chewing gum—their mouths working like machinery. Then comes an exciting point in the case, and again a close-up of the girls is shown, and suddenly, as if at the word of command, they all stop chewing, showing their mental state: excitement— they hold their breath. Excitement may also be indicated purely by facial expression, but it <em>is</em> more arresting to see a mental state reflected by such an original element of action. The staring eyes and heaving breasts have been seen hundreds of times and can no longer make the spectator actually realize “<span>excitement</span>”. But this indirect method of showing it is so fresh that it helps to make the mental state most evident. It is striking because the connection between the external event and the internal emotion is not only conceptual and thematic but profits from a structural similarity between the two. The visible event—a regular rhythmical movement suddenly stopped dead—also contains the most marked characteristic of the inward process: a sudden interruption of the calm interest with which the girls had been following the case. And this is cleverly translated into the sphere of the visible.</p>
        <p>Thus an external event, some little piece of action, is invented which reflects the mental state of the actor. When, in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Woman in the Moon</em>, Willy Fritsch with his paper shears cuts the heads off the flowers standing in a vase on his desk while he is telephoning, his gesture shows much more clearly than his facial expression how agitated he is. Moreover it is real film stuff (even though elementary) because it is action, visible action. In Feyder's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Les Nouveaux Messieurs</em> is a scene where the old Count <em>is</em> telling his friend, the dancer, that the Minister Gaillac has been transferred to a post abroad. Gaillac is secretly Suzanne's lover. She is therefore very much upset by the news but must keep a tight hold on herself and make no sign. How is this done? Suzanne and the Count are having tea. He tells her the news as she <em>is</em> pouring. She does not move a muscle of her face and says politely: “<span>Really?</span>” But her hand grows unsteady, and she spills the tea into the saucer. There was hardly a way of expressing Suzanne's feelings facially, for the point of the scene was that she was obliged to suppress her feelings. Even so, a less capable director, unable to think of a way of circumventing the difficulty in a “<span>filmic</span>” way, would not have hesitated to let the girl act out her shock: start, turn away, look nervously out of the corners of her eyes—and leave the old Count to pretend he noticed nothing. Jacques Feyder, on the contrary, introduces the small episode that enables him to show Suzanne's repressed demeanor and her real feelings at the same time, and this without doing violence to reality. Examples such as these show best what good film work is.</p>
        <p>In this connection Greta Garbo's famous love scene, the cigarette scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Flesh and the Devil</em>, may be recalled. She has met the young officer John Gilbert at a party. They have already danced together very absorbedly, gazing into each other's eyes; but externally everything is still quite conventional—two people who were indifferent to each other might do just the same. Nothing has yet been acknowledged, they only have glimmerings of what might be . . . They go into the garden, the girl takes a cigarette between her lips, the man lights a match, but instead  of lighting up, she makes a tiny retreating movement, the flame illumines the two faces, they look at each other. This sudden arbitrary interruption of the social ritual explains their change of attitude better than any explicit acting out of feelings; it is enough. Something different is going to happen.</p>
        <p>In film inanimate properties are just as useful as the human actor to show psychic states. A broken windowpane may be as good as a quivering mouth, a heap of dead cigarette stubs as the nervous drumming of fingers. Once again the classification—so characteristic of film—of man as one among many objects is plainly revealed. The traces of human strivings are as visible on inanimate objects as they are on the body itself.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Meaning and Invention</h3>
        <p>It is often said that silent films convey no ideas and that indeed it is impossible that they should because language plays too small a part in them. Now if by ideas we mean abstractly formulated thoughts, film will not in fact provide them. But this kind of intellectual content does not play a very great part even in literature—thfe art of words par excellence. In literature language is often used simply to describe concrete events—to say what the characters in a story are doing and thinking, what the surroundings are like; and if the people talk, their conversation generally turns on very concrete matters. It is not the worst kind of literature in which language is used for description and not for abstract reflections. In this matter, then, there is no essential difference between literature and film. Literature uses words for description; film, pictures. In both media the guiding ideas are not given in abstract form but clothed in concrete episodes.</p>
        <p>That films need not lack depth has been proved in many masterpieces. Chaplin's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gold Rush</em> affords memorable examples. There is the scene where Charlie as a starving prospector cooks and eats his dirty oiled boots. Elegantly and with perfect table manners he carves his unusual dish—he lifts off the upper so that the sole with the nails sticking up in it is left like the backbone of a fish from which the meat has been removed; he carefully sucks the nails as if they were chicken bones, and winds the laces round the fork like spaghetti.</p>
        <p>In this scene the contrast between rich and poor is symbolized in an incomparably original, striking, and graphic manner. The same contrast may be made in a film, as has often been done, by showing the scanty meal of a poor man side by side with the luxurious fare of a rich man. Such an effect, however, is taken directly from the abstract, is conventional, unoriginal, and therefore tends to lose its appeal and to become artistically worthless.</p>
        <p>If the scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gold Rush</em> showed nothing but a starving man wolfing a cooked boot, it would be no more than a grotesque caricature of poverty. The excellence and forcibleness of the scene consists in the fact that in depicting misery the contrast of riches is given simultaneously by the most original and visually striking similarity of this meal to that of a rich man.</p>
        <p>Carcass of the boot = carcass of a fish</p>
        <p>Nails = chicken bones</p>
        <p>Bootlaces = spaghetti</p>
        <p>Chaplin makes the contrast painfully clear to the eyes of the spectator by demonstrating the similarity of form of such objectively different things. And the great artistry of the invention lies in that such an elemental, profoundly human theme as “<span>hunger versus good living</span>” is presented pictorially by objective means that are so truly filmic. Nothing more purely visual can be conceived than such association of the shapes of things.</p>
        <p>By eating the most wretched food imaginable as if it were a choice dish, and with suitably elegant manners, Chaplin not only shows poverty as such, but (so to speak) poverty as a low grade of wealth, as a distortion of good living. And by creating this relationship he makes misery seem doubly miserable— since smallness is made small by largeness, and blackness black <em>by</em> whiteness.</p>
        <p>Quite in general, what distinguishes Charlie Chaplin is that he is not only the ragged vagabond but he <em>is</em> the destitute person shown in the perspective of the wealthy. HiV jaunty bowler hat, his coat vaguely resembling a dinner jacket, his dandified little stick and mustache describe poverty as the lack of riches. This is much more striking than unrelated “<span>ragged-ness</span>”.</p>
        <p>Another scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gold Rush</em> which was invented on the same principle as the boot dinner is the one where the big gold miner, half-crazed with hunger, suddenly sees his mate Charlie as a fowl and tries to catch him and eat him. Charlie's helpless gesticulations turn into the flapping of wings, and when he leans over the stove the chicken seems to be bending down to drink. The climax of the craving for food, when man lays violent hands on man, when the friend's body becomes edible flesh—a deep-seated feature of the human mind—is again made pictorial by an unexpected resemblance, this time between the appearance of the friend and a fine fat chicken. And once again it is the visual similarity of intrinsically opposite things that expresses the dramatic contradiction.</p>
        <p>One more example from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gold Rush:</em> Charlie has attained the height of his desires—he is dancing with the girl he adores. But his trousers are slipping, and he seizes a rope and ties it round his waist. A large dog is tied to the other end of the rope and has to join in the dance. Thus, even when he achieves happiness and success, the ballast of bad luck is tied to him.</p>
        <p>Two examples from Chaplin's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Woman of Paris:</em> a girl brings another the exciting news that her lover <em>is</em> unfaithful to her. The friend is being massaged and, while the two girls are discussing the matter with great emotion, the masseuse is seen carrying on her work dully and unmoved; she swings backward and forward in time with her hands as calmly as the pendulum of a clock; and quite mechanically without betraying any interest she keeps looking first at one and then at the other of the two excited girls. This robot-like indifference which—in true film fashion—is depicted not only by the expression on her face but by the unruffled backward and forward movement of her body, brings the perturbation of the two main figures into high relief. The fact that the world rolls on quietly and inevitably even though certain individuals are desperate <em>is</em> very strikingly symbolized by a particular event.</p>
        <p>A similar theme, though differently depicted, <em>is</em> in Pudovkin's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The End of St. Petersburg</em>. Two peasants are on their way to the city. This is their last hope— they have nothing more to eat. Struggling on in silent despair against the wind they cross field after field. Then a windmill <em>is</em> shown, its vanes revolving calmly and indifferently. Pudovkin has flashed this picture into that of the two peasants several times—it symbolizes the world moving steadily on, and serves as a contrasting foil to the dramatic action.</p>
        <p>The final scene in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">A Woman of Paris:</em> The man and woman, Adolphe Menjou and Edna Purviance, have parted. She now lives in the country. One day she is driving along the road in a cart with her pupils, when her farmer lover comes from the other direction in a fine car. The vehicles pass without the occupants recognizing each other, the motorcar vanishes in the distance—it is the end of the film. Here again the abstract fact has been transposed with absolute faithfulness into concrete form: the paths of two lives cross and separate. But the concrete episode which <em>is</em> chosen to show it <em>is</em> not conventional or trite, it is very original; the superimposition of two congruent things—the path of life and the country road—is brilliant and arresting.</p>
        <p>If one examines Chaplin's development, one finds that the human quality of his humorous inventions grows increasingly profound. The first two-reelers, which are hardly distinguishable from those of other artists of the same period, consist of inventions that are pure jokes, with little or no serious background. They are also brilliant and amusing, but are not to be compared with films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Gold Rush</em>, in which the profound sadness of the jesting brings tears to the eyes.</p>
        <p>Even in the first shorts the inventions often rest upon the principle that unexpected associations are created between very divergent objects. Charlie as assistant to a pawnbroker examines the alarm clock brought in by a customer as if he were a doctor examining a patient. He puts a stethoscope to his ears and listens to the clock ticking (heartbeat—clockwork), then percusses it with a hammer, most carefully and with a deadly serious face, takes off the back with a can opener (food can—alarm clock), pulls the wheels and springs out with a pair of tweezers, and eventually throws the whole pile of oddments into the unhappy owner's hat saying that the clock is no use to him. This scene is very comic but essentially unenlightening, unless one wishes to maintain, as one critic did, that an amusing parallel with psychoanalysis is suggested. Unexpected likeness of form or function <em>is</em> used, but there is no sort of inherent connection between the things that are <em>so</em> joined—there is no deeper meaning to the idea of equating a food can and an alarm clock, a heartbeat and the ticking of a clock. The fact that these things are objectively so far apart, but are <em>so</em> ingeniously brought together, is the whole substance of such a “<span>gag</span>”. This principle of demonstrating unexpected formal similarities in things objectively quite unconnected is also used frequently in other forms of art. The aesthetic attraction of rhyme as of alliteration is due to the stress laid on the formal similarity of words that are not similar in their meanings. (It may be possible by such an explanation to derive rhyme and alliteration from the same aesthetic principle.) Novelists use the same device in inventing telling episodes. No doubt there is something similar in music. It would be interesting to investigate these connections more closely.</p>
        <p>On the other hand there are relations to the psychology of productive thinking. A sudden change in the functions of an object or episode is found as often in comic films as in processes of thought, and in these as often as in jokes. For example—Charlie Chaplin as a policeman. The burly gangster in order to frighten the little man bends a gas lamp as if it were a piece of wire. Charlie grasps the lamp and pulls it down a little farther until the big man's head is covered by the glass, shade—gas pours into the shade and the “<span>heavy</span>” <em>is</em> overcome by it. The function of the gas lamp has thus been “<span>restructured</span>”. At first, its psychological character is merely that of a strong pole, something that can be bent to attest one's strength. The shade, in itself merely a protection for the incandescent mantle, suddenly and unexpectedly turns into a container for a head. The gas, hitherto used only for illumination, is suddenly turned into a weapon, and the bending of the lamp pole, which was primarily nothing but the consequence of a trial of strength, becomes the condition that is necessary to apply the medical procedure of anesthetizing a man with gas.</p>
        <p>The same processes frequently take place when someone has a “<span>good idea</span>” or suddenly understands something. The psychologist Kdhler has shown this by experiments in animal psychology: when chimpanzees suddenly realize, for example, that some wooden boxes lying about their cage can be used to erect a structure to help them climb up to the fruit which is hanging at the top of the cage. Here too an object changes its function in an unexpected manner. (Cf. here Max Wertheimer's work on productive thinking.)</p>
        <p>And finally, when the naked man whom the deceived husband finds in the bedroom closet answers the question as to what he is doing there in the famous words; “<span>You won't believe me, but I'm waiting for a bus!</span>” an episode (“<span>a man stands waiting</span>”) is also suddenly and unexpectedly restructured. Except that in a joke, as in a comic film, the effect is amusing chiefly because there is no meaningful connection between the two externally similar features, but in a “<span>good idea</span>” (the apes') the restructuring makes for success and enlightenment.</p>
        <p>Chaplin's inventions are thoroughly “<span>filmic</span>” but usable not only in film. In the music-hall turns of the clown Grock, for instance, there were gags that would not be out of place in a Chaplin film. They were based entirely on optical principles—as when Grock suddenly used as a slide the lid of the piano, which he had lifted off and set standing up against the instrument. Here too is a definite restructuring: a slope is made out of the lid leaning up against the grand piano—primarily nothing more than a superfluous part that has been laid aside. The purely accidental and irrelevant fact of its oblique position becomes a usable attribute. Chaplin's pantomimic tricks are applicable not only to the film but also to the theater stage (his career began on the music-hall stage) because the early American film comedies represent a film style before the “<span>discovery</span>” of the camera and montage. In these early films, camera and montage serve mainly as technical recording devices for what is acted out on the scene, and are therefore unessential.</p>
        <p>In Eisenstein's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The General Line</em> a tractor is seen crashing through the fences that cut up a field into a number of small holdings. The scene is intended to convey symbolically that the tractor, the emblem of modern agriculture, enforces collectivism. This idea is, however, not of a very high grade artistically because the episode that is shown simply makes a concrete scene of an abstract notion, regardless of whether it is likely to occur in reality. In a “<span>naturalistic</span>” film any symbolic scene must be so planned that it not only makes this implicit meaning visible in a comprehensible manner, but also fits smoothly into the action and tfie world depicted in the film. For the unexpected and gripping effect is produced mainly by disclosing the congruence of two themes which are fraught with meaning inherently and independently of each other. In the Eisenstein example, one of the two themes (the concrete) is sacrificed to the other (the symbolized thought), and the congruence is achieved artificially. There is something contrived about using a tractor to crash the fences. The scene is reminiscent of Ermler's <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Fragment of an Empire</em>, in which a tank runs over a crucifix to which a terrified soldier is clinging—although since this scene makes no pretense at reality, it cannot be attacked on the score of artificiality.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the effect <em>is</em> excellent when, in the same Eisenstein film, a bureaucratic Soviet official cleans his pen on the china head of Lenin that adorns his inkpot. Here we have the underlying idea— “<span>bureaucrats smirch the ideal of the revolution</span>”— made concrete without any interference with the natural progress of events. The most common symbol of the revolution—Lenin—<em>is</em> brought into the same picture and the same action with the official in an un-contrived manner, and the smirching is very naturally motivated in the concrete event.</p>
        <p>In contrast to this is another scene from A <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Woman of Paris:</em> The girl implores her lover to marry her, as she is longing for a regular married life and children. The lover—to put an end to the tiresome discussion—steps over to the window and looks out. He sees a fat woman, cross and worn-out by a family of naughty children; smiling, he draws the girl toward the window and points out the group. Though amusing, this is not a particularly clever invention, because the abstract idea, which has to be made concrete and brought into the scene (“<span>drawbacks to married life</span>”), is rather too obviously “<span>dragged in</span>”. The fat woman has no connection with the main plot, her appearance is purely symbolic, a mere coincidence without inherent motivation. And such coincidences are out of place in a work of art.</p>
        <p>Invention is by no means used only to express abstract ideas in film. Often the clever devices are simply intended to depict a factual part of the narrative aptly and impressively. For example: a girl has had a baby that she would like to be rid of. The picture shows first the mother standing outside the front door of an apartment (so that the door is more or less concealed); the door opens; a stout woman admits the visitor; the door is closed and now the name-plate Js seen: “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Mrs. Jones. Midwife</span>”. This is not a particularly brilliant invention, but it gives an idea of the technique by which things are made clear that would otherwise not be obvious from the pictured episode. Who is the woman whom the girl has gone to see? The nameplate lies naturally in the course of the narrative. A clever touch is the moment's tension that is achieved by not giving the explanation until the episode has passed and the door is shut again.</p>
        <p>Finally, the meaning of a film scene that goes beyond mere narration need not always be an abstractly formulable idea. In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The General Line</em> the peasant wpman comes to the fat kulak and lays her petition before him. He sits up on his couch, picks up a ladle, takes a large spoonful out of a huge bowl of punch, drinks it, then speaks, refusing the request, and sinks lazily back onto his pillow. While he <em>is</em> dropping back, a close-up is shown of the ladle dropping into the bowl, with a very similar slapping motion. The parallel that is here drawn introduces no abstract idea. The visual essence, so to speak, of the main action is simply repeated as a sort of metaphoric echo in a different material and therefore made particularly emphatic.</p>
        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no"><em>4 The Complete Film</em></h2>
        <p>The technical development of the motion picture will soon carry the mechanical imitation of nature to an extreme. The addition of sound was the first obvious step in this direction. The introduction of sound film must be considered as the imposition of a technical novelty that did not lie on the path the best film artists were pursuing. They were engaged in working out an explicit and pure style of silent film, using its restrictions to transform the peep show into an art. The introduction of sound film smashed many of the forms that the film artists were using in favor of the inartistic demand for the greatest possible “<span>naturalness</span>” (in the most superficial sense of the word). By sheer good luck, sound film is not only destructive but also offers artistic potentialities of its own. Owing to this accident alone the majority of art-lovers still do not realize the pitfalls in the road pursued by the movie producers. They do not see that the film <em>is</em> on its way to the victory of wax museum ideals over creative art.</p>
        <p>The development of the silent film was arrested possibly forever when it had hardly begun to produce good results; but it has left us with a few splendidly mature films. In the future, no doubt, “<span>progress</span>” will be faster. We shall have color films and stereoscopic films, and the artistic potentialities of the sound film will be crushed at an even earlier stage of their development.</p>
        <p>What will the color film have to offer when it reaches technical perfection? We know what we shall lose artistically by abandoning the black-and-white film. Will color ever allow us to achieve a similar compositional precision, a similar independence of “<span>reality?</span>”</p>
        <p>The masterpieces of painting prove that color provides wider possibilities than black-and-white and at the same time permits of a very exact and genuine style. JBut can painting and color photography be compared? Whereas the painter has a perfectly free hand with color and form in presenting nature, photography is obliged to record mechanically the light values of physical reality. In achromatic photography the reduction of everything to the gray scale resulted in an art medium that was sufficiently independent and divergent from nature. There is not much likelihood of any such transposition of reality into a qualitatively different range of colors in color film. To be sure, one can eliminate individual colors—one may, for example, cut out all blues, or, vice versa, one may c^t out everything except the blues. Probably it is possible also to change one or more color tones qualitatively—for example, give all reds a cast of orange or make all the yellows greenish—or let colors change places with one another—turn all blues to red and all reds to blue—but all this would be, so to speak, only transposition of reality, mechanical shifts, whose usefulness as a formative medium may be doubted. Hence there remains only the possibility of controlling the color by clever choice of what is to be photographed. All kinds of fine procedures are conceivable, especially in the montage of colored pictures, but it must not be overlooked that in this way the subjective formative virtues of the camera, which are so distinctive a characteristic of film, will be more and more restricted, and the artistic part of the work will be more and more focused upon what is set up and enacted <em>before</em> the camera. The camera is thereby increasingly relegated to the position of a mere mechanical recording machine.</p>
        <p>Above all, it is hardly realistic to speculate on the artistic possibilities of the color film without keeping in mind that at the same time we are likely to be presented with the three-dimensional film and the wide screen. Efforts in these directions are in progress. The illusion of reality will thereby have been increased to such a degree that the spectator will not be able to appreciate certain artistic color effects even if they should be feasible technically. It is quite conceivable that by a careful choice and arrangement of objects it might be possible to use the color on the projection surface artistically and harmoniously. But if the film image becomes stereoscopic there is no longer a plane surface within the confines of the screen, and therefore there can be no composition of that surface; what remains will be effects that are also possible on the stage. The increased size of the screen will render any two-dimensional or three-dimensional composition less compelling; and formative devices such as montage and changing camera angles will become unusable if the illusion of reality is so enormously strengthened, Obviously, montage will seem an intolerable accumulation of heterogeneous settings if the illusion of reality is very strong. Obviously also a change in the position of the camera will now be felt as an actual displacement within the space of the picture. The camera will have to become an immobile recording machine, every cut in the film strip will be mutilation. Scenes will have to be taken in their entire length and with a stationary camera, and they will have to be shown as they are. The artistic potentialities of this form of film will be exactly those of the stage. Film will no longer be able in any sense to be considered as a separate art. It will be thrown back to before its first beginnings—for it was with a fixed camera and an uncut strip that film started. The only difference will be that instead of having all before it film will have nothing to look forward to.</p>
        <p>This curious development signifies to some extent the climax of that striving after likeness to nature which has hitherto permeated the whole history of the visual arts. Among the strivings that make human beings create faithful images is the primitive desire to get material objects into one's power by creating them afresh. Imitation also permits people to cope with significant experiences; it provides release, and makes for a kind of reciprocity between the self and the world. At the same time a reproduction that is true to nature provides the thrill that by the hand of man an image has been created which is astoundingly like some natural object. Nevertheless, various counter-tendencies—some of them purely perceptual—have prevented mechanically faithful imitation from being achieved hundreds of years ago. Apart from rare exceptions, only our modern age has succeeded in approaching this dangerous goal. In practice, there has always been the artistic urge not simply to copy but to originate, to interpret, to mold. We may, however, say that aesthetic theory has rarely sanctioned such activities. Even for artists like Leonardo da Vinci the demand for being as true to nature as possible was a matter of course when he talked theory, and Plato's attack on artists, in which he charged them with achieving nothing but reproductions of physical objects, is far from the general attitude.</p>
        <p>To this very day some artists cherish this doctrine, and the general public does so to an even greater extent. In painting and sculpture it <em>is</em> only in recent decades that works have been appearing which show that their creators have broken with this principle intellectually and not merely practically. If a man considers that the artist should imitate nature, he may possibly paint like Van Gogh, but certainly not like Paul Klee. We know that the very powerful and widespread rejection of modern art is almost entirely supported by the argument that it is not true to nature. The development of film shows clearly how all-powerful this ideal still is.</p>
        <p>Photography and its offspring, film, are art media so near to nature that the general public looks upon them as superior to such old-fashioned and imperfect imitative techniques as drawing and painting. Since on economic grounds film is much more dependent on the general public than any other form of art, the “<span>artistic</span>” preferences of the public sweep everything before them. Some work of good quality can be smuggled in but it does not compensate for the more fundamental defeats of film art. The complete film is the fulfillment of the age-old striving for the complete illusion. The attempt to make the two-dimensional picture as nearly as possible like its solid model succeeds; original and copy become practically indistinguishable. Thereby all formative potentialities which were based on the differences between model and copy are eliminated and only what is inherent in the original in the way of significant form remains to art.</p>
        <p>H. Baer in a remarkable little essay in the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Kunstblatt</em> has pointed out that color film represents the accomplishment of tendencies which have long been present in graphic art.</p>
        <p>“<span>Graphic art (he says)—of which photography <em>is</em> one branch—has always striven after color. The oldest woodcuts, the blockbooks, were finished off by being handpainted. Later, a second, colored, plate was added to the black-and-white—as in Diirers portrait of 'Ulrich Varnbuhler/ A magnificent picture of a knight in armor in black, silver, and gold, exists by Burgmair. In the eighteenth century multicolored etchings were produced. In the nineteenth the lithographs of Daumier and Gavarni are colored in mass production . . . Color invaded the graphic arts as an increasea attraction for the eye. Uncivilized man is not as a rule satisfied with black-and-white. Children, peasants and primitive peoples demand the highest degree <em>on</em> bright coloring. It is the primitives of the great cities who congregate before the film screen, Therefore film calls in the aid of bright colors. It is a fresh stimulus</span>”.</p>
        <p>In itself, the perfection of the “<span>complete</span>” film need not be a catastrophe—if silent film, sound film, and colored sound film were allowed to exist alongside it. There is no objection to the “<span>complete</span>” film as an alternative to the stage—it might help to take into remote places fine performances of good works, as also of operas, musical comedies, ballets, the dance. Moreover, by its very existence it would probably have an excellent influence on the other—the real— film forms, by forcing them to advance along their own lines. Silent film, for example, would no longer provide dialogue in its titles, because then the absence of the spoken word would be felt as artificial and disturbing. In sound film, too, any vague intermediate form between it and the stage would be avoided. Just as the stage will feel itself obliged by the very existence of film to emphasize its own characteristic—the predominance of dramatic speech—so the “<span>complete</span>” film could relegate the true film forms to their own sphere.</p>
        <p>The fact is, however, that whereas aesthetically these categories of film could and should exist along with mechanically complete reproduction, they are inferior to it in the capacity to imitate nature. Therefore the “<span>complete</span>” film is certain to be considered an advance upon the preceding film forms, and will supplant them all.</p>
