        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">1957: Personal Note</h2>
        <p>The writings that are here collected date back to the thirties. The first part of the book is taken from <em>Film</em>, written and published under the title <em class="notranslate" translate="no"> Film ah Kunst</em> in Germany, shortly before Hitler came to power. An English translation by L. M. Sieveking and Ian F. D. Morrow was published in 1933 in London by Faber and Faber, who graciously gave permission for this partial republication. The book has been out of print for many years. The articles written in 1933 and 1934 in Rome for the projected <em class="notranslate" translate="no"> Enciclopedia del Cinema</em> are printed here for the first time. I have translated them from the German manuscripts. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">A Forecast of Television</span>”  was published in <em class="notranslate" translate="no"> Intercine</em>, a periodical of the International Institute for Educational Film, in February 1935. “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">A New Laocoon</span>”  is translated from the original Italian text, which appeared in 1938 in <em class="notranslate" translate="no"> Bianco e Nero</em>, a monthly connected with the State film school in Rome.</p>
        <p>To go back to my writings about film means more than retracing my steps. It means reopening a closed chapter. The reader of this book will find that film is, to me, a unique experiment in the visual arts which took place in the first three decades of this century. In its pure state it survives in the private efforts of a few courageous individuals; and occasional flares, reminiscent of a distinguished past, light up the mass production of the film industry, which permitted the new medium to become a comfortable technique for popular storytelling. Correspondingly, the author of this book has changed from a monomaniac, who sank into his studies of the motion picture whatever he had learned about psychology and art, to a stray customer, who gratefully enjoys—a few times a year—the screen performances of intelligent artists and for the rest refers to the film in his lectures and writings when a contribution of the animated photograph serves to illustrate a particular point. Thus in a recent book, <em class="notranslate" translate="no"> Art and Visual Perception</em>, film and filmlike effects carry much of the chapter on motion.</p>
        <p>Compared with the broader aspects of artistic vision, which have absorbed my attention lately, film seems a limited subject. Yet what attracted the young student in the twenties was not only the new, phantastic, inquisitive, aggressive, and sentimental play of moving shadows in itself, but also a critical challenge to certain principles of theory. It frequently happens that a guiding theme, whose development will occupy a man's later life, takes shape around his twentieth year. At about that time I started to make copious notes on what I called <em class="notranslate" translate="no"> Materialtheorie</em>. It was a theory meant to show that artistic and scientific descriptions of reality are cast in molds that derive not so much from the subject matter itself as from the properties of the medium—or <em>Material</em>—employed. I was impressed by the geometrically and numerically simple forms, by the regularity and symmetry found in early cosmologies as well as in Bohr's atomic model, in philosophical systems, and in the art of primitives and children. At the time, my teachers Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Kohler were laying the theoretical and practical foundations of gestalt theory at the Psychological Institute of the University of Berlin, and I found myself fastening on to what may be called a Kantian turn of the new doctrine, according to which even the most elementary processes of vision do not produce mechanical recordings of the outer world but organize the sensory raw material creatively according to principles of simplicity, regularity, and balance, which govern the receptor mechanism. This discovery of the gestalt school fitted the notion that the work of art, too, is not simply an imitation or selective duplication of reality but a translation of observed characteristics into the forms of a given medium. Now obviously, when art was thus asserted to be an equivalent rather than a derivative, photography and film represented a test case. If a mechanical reproduction of reality, made by machine, could be art, then the theory was wrong. In other words, it was the precarious encounter of reality and art that teased me into action. I undertook to show in detail how the very properties that make photography and film fall short of perfect reproduction can act as the necessary molds of an artistic medium. The simplicity of this thesis and the obstinate consistency of its demonstration explain, I believe, why a quarter of a century after the publication of Film the book is—still and again—consulted, asked for, and stolen from libraries.</p>
        <p>The first part of Film, which develops the thesis, has worn reasonably well and is reproduced here practically complete under the headings “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Film and Reality</span>”  and “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Making of a Film</span>” .  I have omitted much of the rest: some of the chapters tangled with tasks for which respectable techniques are now available, such as my sketchy “<span>content analysis</span>”  of the standard movie ideology; others dealt with temporary questions—for example, the early fumblings of the sound film—now mercifully forgotten. The translation of what is left has been revised sentence by sentence, and many a puzzling statement attributed to me in the earlier edition is now restored to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p>More of a problem than the barrier of language, however, was the distance in time. I found myself dealing with my writings as though with the work of a favorite student: pleased to have engendered a kindred mind, a little worried perhaps at his precocious possession of thoughts I cherished as my own, more ruthless in condemnation and correction than when less involved, and yet as meticulous as affection demands. This means that in editing and translating the material I have tried to preserve the meaning rather than the word, the argument rather than the sentence; I have eliminated details that sounded redundant or untenable, built qualifications into brash assertions, tightened loose reasoning. But nothing substantial is changed. I have not added anything, not tried to bring things up to date either with regard to my own thinking or to the technological progress and the film production of the intervening years. Some technical references will sound quaint to the expert of today. No film cited is less than twenty years old, and most of them are much older. I do not consider this a defect. Nothing of what has happened in the meantime seems to me new enough in principle to require inclusion in a book that is not a chronicle but a theory of film, except perhaps the remarkable blossoming of the “<span>abstract</span>”  film—the beginnings of what someday will be the great art of painting in motion. As to my own position, I still believe what I believed then, and I find that my predictions have been borne out. The talking film is still a hybrid medium, which lives from whatever fragments of the visual language were salvageable and from the beauty of the creatures, things, and thoughts it reproduces; the color film, incapable of controlling its multidimensional instrument, has never gone beyond tasteful “<span>color schemes</span>” ; the stereoscopic film is still unrealizable technically, and in its recent substitutes has increased the realism of the performance to the extent of requiring first-aid stations in the theaters without exploiting the new resources artistically; the wide screen, finally, has gone a long way toward destroying the last pretenses of a meaningfully organized image. The critics, to be sure, still find occasion for the highest praise, but then, as a matter of survival, their standards shift with the times. In the meantime, television viewers are noticing that live performances are better than “<span>canned</span>”  ones. This sounds like the knell of justice for the illusionists: he who vies with nature deserves to lose!</p>
        <p>A word should be said about the Italian writings collected in this book. The International Institute for Educational Film, established in Rome by the League of Nations, reached beyond the scope that was defined by its name. When I joined the staff in 1933, its enterprising director, Dr. Luciano de Feo, had begun to collect from experts all over the world material for an encyclopedia which was to cover in two large volumes the historical, artistic, social, technical, educational, and juridical aspects of the motion picture. The work, which was to be published by Ulrico Hoepli in Milan, was in page proof when Italy left the League of Nations in 1938 and all large-scale activity of the institute ceased. As one of the editors of the encyclopedia I wrote many articles, of which two are selected here. The longer piece, “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Thoughts That Made the Picture Move</span>” ,  discusses the many quaint technical devices that finally led to the inventions of Lumiere and Edison; but instead of treating them in their historical order, as has been done more completely by others, it considers them as the stages of a thought process that took place collectively in many brains.</p>
        <p>“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">A New Laocoon,</span>”  last in this collection, was also last to be written. Exasperatingly quixotic though the piece may appear even in this somewhat shortened English version, it raises the basic aesthetic question of how various media can be combined in one work of art. By putting film in the context of the other arts, it also broadens the basis of operation and leads on to problems that lie beyond the covers of this book.</p>
        <p>Something more hopeful and more helpful might have been written, the reader may feel, if there had been less insistence on “<span>art</span>”  and more gratitude for useful and enjoyable evenings spent in the movie theater. Indeed there would be little justification for an indictment that charged violation of this or that aesthetic code. The issue is a more real one. Shape and color, sound and words are the means by which man defines the nature and intention of his life. In a functioning culture, his ideas reverberate from his buildings, statues, songs, and plays. But a population constantly exposed to chaotic sights and sounds is gravely handicapped in finding its way. When the eyes and ears are prevented from perceiving meaningful order, they can only react to the brutal signals of immediate satisfaction.</p>
        <p>This book, then, is a book of standards. It will help preserve the remnants of the attempts to reflect our century in undisturbed animated images. It will transmit some of the principles derived from that experience to the new generation of devotees, who are crowding the showings of the film societies, struggling as private film makers, experimenting with amateur cameras, trying to smuggle the goods into advertising and television, or haunting the mansions of the motion-picture industry. Trying to preserve the standards is worth while. In the thirties, the Italian students who are now the directors and script-writers of many of the admired neorealistic films were hamstrung by Fascism. They found an outlet in analyzing the classics of film art and the texts of film theory with the fanatic devotion of cloistered medieval scholars. Their imagination and keen observation could hardly have borne such remarkable fruit, were it not for the erudition and the sense of quality acquired in those years. Their works are full of good quotations. These films and those of other talented artists, however, are also beset by the impurities that are so amply diagnosed in this book. It is the business of the theorist to inspect the tools and to ask that they be cleaner. At the same time he is darkly aware of what the reckless practice of the arts has done to his standards in the past and will do to them in the future. Having delivered his admonition, he secretly puts some trust in the messy shrewdness that for so long has been the hope of the human condition.</p>
