        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Fabula: Elements</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">1: Preliminary Remarks</h3>
        <p>The fabulas of most narrative texts display some form of homology, both with sentence structure and with “real life”. Consequently, most fabulas can be said to be constructed according to the demands of human logic of events, provided that this concept is not too narrowly understood. This point of departure suggests that everything that can be said about the structure of fabulas also bears to some degree on extra-literary facts. Consequently, everything that is said in this chapter should also be applicable to other connected series of human actions as well as to elements in film, theatre, news reports, and social and individual events in the world. It helps to keep in mind that the theory of elements, even more generally than that of aspects, makes describable a segment of reality that is broader than that of narrative texts only.</p>
        <p>The material that constitutes the fabula can be divided into stable and changeable elements – objects, on the one hand, and processes, on the other. <em>Elements</em> may be understood not only as the actors, who are more or less stable in most fabulas, but also as locations and things. <em>Processes</em> are the changes that occur in, with, through, and among the objects – in other words, the events. Both sorts of elements – objects and processes – are indispensable for the construction of a fabula. They cannot operate without each other. For reasons and in ways that will become clear, I maintain in this chapter a structuralist approach.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">2: Events</h3>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Selection</em></strong></p>
        <p>In the Introduction I defined events as the transition from one state to another state, caused or experienced by actors. The word “transition” stresses that an event is a process, an alteration. Trying to establish which sentences in a text represent an event is the beginning of a fabula analysis. This appears an arid, technical endeavour, but it is already an interpretive step.</p>
        <p>Many sentences refer to elements that may be considered processes. These same elements can often be objects as well as processes, depending on the context. Such a selection results in an enormously large number of elements, impossible to work with. I will discuss three criteria, each of which further limits the number of events to be investigated, and each of which further develops a different aspect of the definition of events given above.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Change</em></strong></p>
        <p>Compare these two sentences:</p>
        <p>a John is ill.</p>
        <p>b John falls ill.</p>
        <p>The first sentence describes a condition, the second a change. The difference can be seen in the verb. So we can begin by examining the series of events in which sentence b might occur. Imagine that the preceding text segment read as follows:</p>
        <p>c John was cleaning his house.</p>
        <p>John’s illness interrupts his activity and, as such, indicates a change. But in that case, sentence c can precede sentence a <em>or</em> sentence b equally well.</p>
        <p>d John was cleaning his house. John is ill. Is just as intelligible as</p>
        <p>e John was cleaning his house. John fell ill.</p>
        <p>In both cases the cleaning activities are interrupted, although in neither case is this explicitly stated. Sentences d and e differ in the same way from, for example, a text segment such as:</p>
        <p>f John was cleaning his house. John fell ill and therefore had to stop cleaning.</p>
        <p>The explicit relationship established in segment f is only implied in d and e. The relationship between c and a, or between c and b, is decisive for an analysis of the events; it is only in a series that events become meaningful for the further development of the fabula.</p>
        <p>So it is pointless to consider whether or not an isolated fact is an event. The linguistic form in which the information is embodied can be an indication, but it is not always decisive. Furthermore, the general assumption that every event is indicated by a verb of action doesn’t work either. It is, of course, possible to restate every event so that a verb of action appears in the sentence, as, for example, with the verb “stop” in sentence f. This provides a convenient means of making explicit any implicit relationships between facts, and can lead to a preliminary selection of events.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Choice</em></strong></p>
        <p>In a famous article Roland Barthes distinguished between functional and non-functional events. Functional events open a choice between two possibilities, realize this choice, or reveal the results of such a choice. Once a choice is made, it determines the subsequent course of events in the development of the fabula. Compare the following text segments:</p>
        <p>g Liz leaves her house to go to work. She turns left and walks straight ahead. She arrives at eight-thirty.</p>
        <p>h Liz leaves her house to go to work. She walks straight ahead, and crosses the street. Unconscious, she is carried into a hospital at eight-thirty.</p>
        <p>Again, something is implied in both text segments: in g, that Liz successfully covered a certain distance; in h, that she was run down while crossing the street. If, soon after eight-thirty, something happens at work that influences the further development of the fabula, then the statement “she turns left” may be considered an event: because the actor chose a certain route, she arrived in time to make the following event possible.</p>
        <p>Should that not be the case, it does not mean that turning left has no significance. It can point to some particular characteristic of the actor in question. For example, it can indicate a punctual attitude towards work, a preference for a certain route, or leftish political views; this depends on the network of meaning in the text as a whole. However, for the purpose of the selection of functional events, this text segment doesn’t matter. In segment h, something happens that most probably has consequences for the rest of the fabula. The actor is run down, something that would not have happened if she had chosen the other route. In turn, the accident presents a number of alternatives. Was Liz hit intentionally or not? If so, by an acquaintance or by a stranger?</p>
        <p>Questions such as these could form the subject for a detective story. But even if the result of segment h is more spectacular than that of segment g, this does not imply that such an event as the one in segment h always satisfies the criterion. If this text segment is unrelated to the rest of the fabula and refers instead only to the world in which the fabula occurs – the accident can, for example, illustrate traffic congestion during the rush hour – then the choice in segment h between turning left and crossing the street is not a functional event. This is why the analogy with the sentence only goes so far; it is also why analogy with “real life” cannot determine the result of the analysis.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Confrontation</em></strong></p>
        <p>Two actors or groups of actors can be confronted to each other. Every phase of the fabula – every functional event – has three components: two actors and one action; stated in the logical terms, two arguments and one predicate; in yet another formulation, two objects and one process. Linguistically, it should be possible to formulate this unity as: two nominal components and one verbal component. The structure of the basis sentence would then be:</p>
        <p>subject – predicate – (direct) object</p>
        <p>in which both the subject and the (direct) object must be actors, agents of action.</p>
        <p>According to this third criterion, only those segments of the text that can be presented by such a basic sentence constitute a functional event. Compare the following text segments:</p>
        <p>i Liz writes a letter.</p>
        <p>j John kills a fly.</p>
        <p>k John kills a woman.</p>
        <p>According to the logical criterion, sentence i is lacking one component. There is a subject, a predicate, and a direct object, but this last component (a letter) is not an actor. The necessary confrontation is, then, impossible. But writing a letter is an activity that presupposes an addressee, just as hiding a secret presupposes someone from whom one is hiding it. The letter is written to someone. Although the second actor is not specifically named in this sentence, his or her existence is implied. Consequently, sentence i can be rewritten with the help of surrounding text segments: Liz writes (a letter to) John (or to the tax inspector, her employees, her friend). Because it is possible to rewrite the sentence in this manner, we may consider it relevant to the structure of the fabula.</p>
        <p>This same possibility is not implied in segment j. Despite the numerous actions performed by John, and the lifestyle that they suggest to the reader, John remains an isolated agent of action. His actions are not considered to be functional events because they do not bring about any change in the relation between John and another (group of) actor(s). Rather than a lack, this is a (negative) sign of the life of people living in isolation.</p>
        <p>Sentences j and k share a common subject and predicate; both sentences can provide just as much information about the character of the subject, but the difference between the two is clear. Here again, the nature of the direct object itself cannot provide a definite answer. Again, the answer as to whether either the fly or the woman may be considered an actor depends on the context. It is quite possible to imagine a fabula in which John is continually confronted by a fly, as in La Fontaine’s fable “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Coche et la Mouche</span>”, for example; on the other hand, a murder can serve to illustrate a character trait and have no influence whatsoever on the development of the fabula, as in the short story “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">The Man That Turned into a Statue</span>” by Joyce Carol Oates. In this text, a woman who can in no way be considered an actor is murdered.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Relationships</em></strong></p>
        <p>According to the definition used here, a fabula is a series of logically and chronologically related events. Once we have decided which facts we wish to consider events, we can then describe the relationships that connect one event to the other: the structure of the series of events. Starting from Barthes’s assumption that all fabulas are based on one model, we can begin to search for a model that is so abstract that it may be considered universal – until, that is, the model in question is either rejected or improved. This model is then laid upon the text investigated; in other words, we examine the way in which the concrete events can be placed in the basic model.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this method is not to force the text into a general model and then to conclude that the text is indeed narrative. Such a procedure has given structuralist narratology a bad name. It could at best be useful for testing doubtful cases when trying to specify the corpus. Rather, a confrontation between a concrete fabula and a general model allows the description of the structure of the fabula of the text in question to be formulated more precisely, so that the specific structure is placed in relief and made visible. A perfect fit as well as any deviations from the model can influence the meaning of the text.</p>
        <p>One model that makes ample provision for this possibility is the one suggested by Bremond. According to him, the narrated universal is regulated by the same rules as those which control human thought and action. These rules are determined by logical and conventional restrictions. A logical rule is, for example, that effect succeeds cause; thus, the hero dies after the bullet strikes him. A conventional restriction is, for example, that a worker is not rich. Conventional restrictions could be seen as the interpretation, by historically and culturally determined groups, of logical rules in concrete situations. Also included among the conventional restrictions are the traditional rules to which texts of specific genres must conform; for example, a classical tragedy takes place in the mythical upper-class circles of kings and gods. Conventional restrictions are based in ideological and political assumptions. This is more obvious for older texts, or texts from other cultures, than for what is close by, because what is normal for one reader need not be so for others. For example, the convention that was broken by Madame de Lafayette’s heroine in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Princess of Cleves</em>, who – unheard of! implausible! – told her husband that she was in love with someone else, would hardly be felt by today’s readers. “What’s the fuss about?” could be the response of readers who are insensitive to the cultural differences between the seventeenth-century French upper classes and many segments of today’s European societies.</p>
        <p>It is a mistake to take conventional restrictions for universal rules. But at the same time, the opposite tendency – to shrug off those norms that one doesn’t share – makes reading a very limited experience and makes reading texts from other cultures seem tedious. It is, therefore, even today (or perhaps <em>precisely</em> today), worthwhile to test one’s own norms against what can be gleaned from different narrative artefacts, by asking the question of the model’s fit. Like every model, Bremond’s model is abstract. This implies that he presents terms that can represent a large number of events; the events from every distinct fabula can thus be translated into these abstract terms. In this way, the relations among the events can be made visible.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Narrative Cycle</em></strong></p>
        <p>A fabula can be viewed as a specific grouping of series of events. The fabula as a whole constitutes a process, and every event can also be called a process or, at least, part of a process. Theories are sometimes old, indeed tenacious. According to Aristotle as well as Bremond, three phases can be distinguished in every fabula: the possibility (or virtuality), the event (or realization), and the result (or conclusion) of the process. None of these three phases is indispensable. A possibility can just as well be realized as not. And even if the event is realized, a successful conclusion is not always ensured. The following example illustrates these possibilities:</p>
        <p>a Liz wants to earn a diploma.</p>
        <p>The following alternatives are possible:</p>
        <p>1 Liz wants to earn a diploma (a possibility)</p>
        <p>2a She prepares for the exam (realization)</p>
        <p>2b She does not prepare for the exam (no realization)</p>
        <p>In b, the cycle is prematurely completed; in a, the third phase begins:</p>
        <p>3a She passes the exam (conclusion)</p>
        <p>3b She fails the exam (negative conclusion, which can lead to the recommencement of the cycle)</p>
        <p>These phases cannot always be explicitly found in the text, as is demonstrated in example b:</p>
        <p>b John wants to offer his girlfriend a lovely dinner. The beef Stroganoff tastes delicious. (The butcher was closed so John serves a sandwich.) (The beef was excellent but, unfortunately, burnt.)</p>
        <p>This is an elaboration of Barthes’s criterion for selection. Bremond calls this first grouping an elementary series. These series are combined with one another. The combination of elementary series into complex series can assume a variety of forms. The processes can occur one after the other. In this case, the result of the first process is also the beginning (virtuality) of the new process.</p>
        <p>c John is tired (= he can rest)</p>
        <p>He rests (= he feels fine again)</p>
        <p>He feels fine (= he can work again) = John feels fine (= he can work); He works (= he becomes tired); He is tired (= he can rest), etc.</p>
        <p>The processes can also be embedded in another process, as, for example, when one possibility opens another, or when one realization leads to another possibility.</p>
        <p>d John is tired (= he can fall asleep)</p>
        <p>John falls asleep = John can forget about his exam; He forgets about his exam; He fails</p>
        <p>John feels fine again</p>
        <p>In this example, the <em>primary series</em> leads to an improvement in John’s condition, and the <em>embedded series</em> leads to a deterioration. As is apparent from this example, the so-called primary series is not necessarily more important than the embedded series in order for the fabula to proceed; the embedded series is probably more important in this example. Such situations can characterize the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">style</em> of a fabula. When, for example, important events are continually embedded in everyday, banal events that are the cause of the important events, an effect of determinism is likely to occur. It can, for example, be read as an expression of fatalism, of the impotency of man against the world, or of an existential view of life. On the other hand, a minimalist fabula where the important events remain unstated but colour the seemingly unimportant, everyday events, tends to become pregnant with importance.</p>
        <p>In d, a causal relationship can be indicated or implied between the primary series and the embedded series. This is not always the case. The embedded series often provides a specification of the primary series.</p>
        <p>e Peter insults John</p>
        <p>John is angry = John asks for an explanation</p>
        <p>Peter explains John is no longer angry = John understands</p>
        <p>In this example, asking for an explanation is a specific form of being angry. It is also possible to express anger in another way, for example, by hitting someone; in this case, another embedded series with another specification of the primary series would evolve.</p>
        <p>There are innumerable possibilities for succession and embedding, so that an infinite number of fabulas can be formed. Bremond’s further structuring of these series is based on his definition of narrative texts: “A narrative consists of a language act by which a succession of events having human interest are integrated into the unity of this same act” (1973, 186). This definition differs from the definition given earlier in this book only by the addition of “human interest”. Because this difference is actually a theoretical issue – and, in fact, one of reception – I will not discuss the issue further at this point. But it deserves some thought that so many narratives hold the reader’s attention by precisely some form of human interest. One division based on human interest is that between processes of improvement and processes of deterioration. Both sorts are possible, both can be realized or not, and both can conclude successfully or not.</p>
        <p>Example e represents a possible deterioration that is avoided by an embedded improvement. In example d, the process of improvement contains an embedded deterioration, while example c represents an improvement and a deterioration immediately following each other.</p>
        <p class="notranslate" translate="no">Picture</p>
        <p>The various processes of improvement or deterioration, grouped in certain combinations, together constitute a <em>narrative cycle</em>. Each of the various processes has its own semantic contents. Applying a semantic label to an event makes it easier to compare the structures of different fabulas with one another. For example:</p>
        <p>– the fulfilment of the task</p>
        <p>– the intervention of allies</p>
        <p>– the elimination of the opponent</p>
        <p>– the negotiation</p>
        <p>– the attack</p>
        <p>– the satisfaction</p>
        <p>It is quite easy to conceive of other possibilities at the same level of abstraction. When seen as the theoretical abstractions of concrete events, these possibilities can be found in many texts. Satisfaction, for example, can take the form of punishment, revenge, or reward, and these sorts of satisfaction can in turn be further specified.</p>
        <p>The same applies to processes of deterioration. Bremond cites:</p>
        <p>– the misstep</p>
        <p>– the creation of an obligation</p>
        <p>– the sacrifice</p>
        <p>– the endured attack</p>
        <p>– the endured punishment</p>
        <p>A misstep can, for example, take the form of a mistake, an error, a social blunder or moral lapse, or a crime – and applying any of these terms to it is an interpretive step of consequence. And these variations can then assume other concrete forms. The initial situation in a fabula will always be a state of deficiency in which one or more actors want to introduce changes. The development of the fabula reveals that, according to certain patterns, the process of change involves an improvement or deterioration with regard to the initial situation.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Other Principles of Structure</em></strong></p>
        <p>The events selected can be related to one another in a variety of ways. Bremond’s model can be used as a basis, but it can also be left out of consideration, not because it would be invalid but because we can foresee that the results would not be very relevant to the fabula in question. The following suggestions are presented only in order to give an idea of the multitude of possibilities, and, in so doing, to make clear that structures are formed by the investigating subject on the basis of selected events combined with other data. The relationship between the data and what is done with those data is convincing only if it is made explicit and has some degree of relevance. The weather in Virginia Woolf’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">To the Lighthouse is</em> often cold and raw; even so, it does not seem relevant to contrast the events that occur in cold weather with those that occur in good or neutral weather in order to establish a principle of structure.</p>
        <p>First, the events can be grouped on the basis of the identity of the actors involved. If the chronological order is maintained or reconstructed, the fabula is segmented into phases. For example: actor A is the subject from event 1 through 6, actor B is the subject from event 7 through 15, and so on. The same can be done on the basis of the object, the actor who experiences the action. The events in which the two most important actors are confronted by each other can be contrasted with events in which only one of these two actors is involved with another, secondary, actor, and so on.</p>
        <p>Second, classification is possible on the basis of the nature of the confrontation. Is there verbal (spoken), mental (via thoughts, feelings, observations), or bodily contact? Do these contacts succeed, do they fail, or is this impossible to determine? Such data can help us understand difficult modern texts. If, for example, the contact between the two most important actors is predominantly mental and unsuccessful, we can surmise that the theme is alienation, a pre-eminently twentieth-century theme. The relationship between bodily and mental contact can suggest another theme.</p>
        <p>Third, the events can be placed against time. Some events can occur at the same time, others succeed one another. These latter form a linked series, sometimes interrupted by a span of time in which nothing occurs – at least nothing that is narrated. Fourth, the locations where events occur can also lead to the formation of a structure. Different oppositions can be relevant: inside–outside, above–below, city–country, here–there, and so on (Lotman 1977, 33; for a feminist critique, see De Lauretis 1983). These possibilities can be combined with one another. We might foresee, for example, that actor A is always the subject when the events occur inside, and actor S when the scene shifts to the outside; or that the contact always or almost always fails in one case while it succeeds in another; or that A especially desires verbal contact and S mental contact. Thus we can make an intuitive choice – necessitated by the simple fact that we cannot investigate everything – explicit by means of our analysis. This has the advantage of allowing us to pursue our own interests to a great extent while keeping to the same intersubjectively understandable model of analysis.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">3: Actors</h3>
        <p>In defining the concept of event I have used the term actors. In the selection of events and the formation of sequences, actors are always important elements. So in what follows, actors will be regarded in terms of their relation to the sequences of events that they cause or undergo.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Selection</em></strong></p>
        <p>In order to begin to analyse this, it helps first to select which actors must be taken into consideration and which ones need not be. In some fabulas there are actors who have no functional part in the structures of that fabula because they do not cause or undergo functional events. Actors of this type may be left out of consideration. What I said earlier also applies here: the initial disregard of an actor does not mean that this actor lacks significance. It only means that it does not form part of the functional category and therefore need not be taken into consideration. Well-known examples are the porters and maids who open the front doors in many nineteenth-century novels. Such actors act, by opening the door, and thus they fit the definition of actors, but their action does not belong to the category of functional events. Therefore, they fall outside the scope of this analysis. Which, not so incidentally, marks their cultural position more devastatingly than their full participation ever could.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that they cannot be meaningful as an indication of a certain social stratification; and in that case they contribute to the representation of bourgeois society given in such a novel. They can also serve as an indication of a specific use of space; they guard the boundary between inside and outside and demonstrate that boundary’s permeability. In order to limit the actors to the category of functional actors, one may rely on an earlier analysis of events. If this analysis has been skipped, an intuitive summary of the event provides a preliminary starting point that might be tested later, for instance by drawing selective samples. This procedure, however, entails a vicious circle when one makes the summary with a certain subdivision of the actors already in mind. A middle-of-the-road solution might be to ask several people to write a summary, and to use the elements they have in common. In the practice of teaching this is a helpful way to engage students in the collective analysis.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Classes of Actors</em></strong></p>
        <p>Taking as a basis the presupposition that human thinking and action are directed towards an aim, structuralists such as Greimas have constructed a model that represents the relations to the aim. This model claims universal validity for its operative principle and is not limited to invented fabulas. As such, it offers a good opportunity for reflection on the relations between fiction, reality, and truth. This is not a specifically narratological concern.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, the model starts from a teleological relation between the elements of the story. The actors have an intention; they aspire towards an aim. That aspiration is the achievement of something pleasant, agreeable, or favourable, or the evasion of something unpleasant, disagreeable, or unfavourable. The verbs <em>to wish</em> and <em>to fear</em> indicate this teleological relation and are, therefore, used as abstractions of the intentional connections between elements.</p>
        <p>In this model, the classes of actors are called <em class="notranslate" translate="no">actants</em>. An actant is a class of actors who share a certain characteristic quality. That shared characteristic is related to the teleology of the fabula as a whole. An actant is therefore a class of actors whose members have an identical relation to the aspect of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">telos</em> that constitutes the principle of the fabula. That relation we call the function. This is a typically structuralist model: it is conceived in terms of fixed relations between classes of phenomena, which is a standard definition of structure.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Subject and Object</em></strong></p>
        <p>The first and most important relation is between the actor who pursues an aim and the aim itself. That relation may be compared to the one between subject and direct object in a sentence. The first two classes of actors to be distinguished, therefore, are subject and object: actor x aspires towards goal Y; x is a subject-actant, Y an object-actant. For instance, in a typical love story the slots may be filled as follows: John – wants to marry – Mary. John is subject, Mary object, and the element of intention of the fabula takes the form of wanting to marry.</p>
        <p>The object is not always a person. The subject may also aspire towards reaching a certain state. In Stendhal’s 1830 novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Red and the Black</em>, for instance, one might see the following scheme: Julien – wants to acquire – power; or Julien – aspires towards – becoming a powerful man. Other objects of intention found in fabulas are riches, possessions, wisdom, love, happiness, a place in heaven, a bed to die in, an increase in salary, a just society. Thus the actant, and also its concrete embodiment, the actor, are, in theory, disconnected from the embodiment in a person. This is implied in our structural approach. However, since the principle of the fabula resides in its aspect of intention, the practical result is that the subject is usually a person or a personified animal (in animal fables), not an object.</p>
        <p>The following examples give an impression of the multiplicity of possibilities that can be translated into this basic structural scheme:</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">actor/actant-subject</em></p>
        <p>a John</p>
        <p>b Anna Wulf</p>

        <p>d wants to know</p>
        <p>e wants to avoid</p>
        <p>f want to bring about</p>
        <p>g wants to have</p>
        <p>h wants to prevent</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">actor/actant-object</em></p>
        <p>a Mary</p>
        <p>b an independent woman</p>
        <p>c the discovery of their crime</p>
        <p>d the identity of the murderer</p>
        <p>e Millhone’s discovery</p>
        <p>f a classless society</p>
        <p>g a safe return</p>
        <p>h the king’s killing her</p>
        <p>The reader has undoubtedly recognized in this series a number of well-known fabulas or types of fabulas.</p>
        <p>The examples have been chosen from very different types of texts: an epistolary novel (a); a feminist novel (b); a nineteenth-century novel (c); a modern detective novel (d and e); a work of social philosophy (f); a fairy tale (g); a story sequence from folk literature (h). I will return to these examples. It is indeed likely that in very many if not all fabulas, a similar scheme can be pointed to. Which is not yet to say that it helps much to do so.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Power and Receiver</em></strong></p>
        <p>The intention of the subject is in itself not sufficient to reach the object. There are always powers that either allow it to reach its aim or prevent it from doing so. This relation might be seen as a form of communication, and we can, consequently, distinguish a class of actors – consisting of those who support the subject in the realization of its intention, supply the object, or allow it to be supplied or given – whom we shall call the power. The person to whom the object is given is the receiver. The French terms used by Greimas are <em>destinateur</em> and <em>destinataire</em>, and sender and receiver are their most literal translation. However, sender suggests an active intervention or active participation, and this does not always apply; that is why <em>power</em> is perhaps a better term.</p>
        <p>Often the power is not a person but an abstraction – for example, society, fate, time, human self-centredness, or cleverness. The receiver may also be embodied in a person. Thus a typology of fabulas might be related to the concretization of this actant: in fairy tales the sender or power is generally a person, such as a king who under certain conditions gives his daughter in marriage to the aspiring subject. In psychological novels, a character trait of the subject itself is often the power that either facilitates or blocks the achievement of the aim. In many nineteenth-century realist novels the class structure of bourgeois society is decisive – one is determined for life by one’s social background. It is also possible for several powers to be in play at the same time. A combination of a character trait (ambition) and a social power (the division into rich and poor) may conflict as positive and negative power.</p>
        <p>The receiver is often the same person as the subject. S/he desires something or somebody for him- or herself. But, since this is not always the case, it is necessary to specify this class of actors. In principle the subject and the power predominate more, or are more active in a grammatical sense, than the object and the receiver, because they are the agents, or the (grammatical) subject, of the function of either intention/ evasion or giving/receiving.</p>
        <p>I have already mentioned the possibility of the coalescence of two actants in one actor, or the reverse – the concretization of one actant, the power, in several specific powers. This makes us realize that the basis of our model is the principle of numerical inequality; and that this principle, however problematic it may seem, is at once the model’s justification. In principle all actants are represented in each fabula: without actants no relations, without relations no process, without process no fabula. But the number of actors is unlimited. It may happen that in one fabula we find only one actor, a heroine who, for instance, is at war with herself, her passions, her madness, and so on. On the other hand, it is also possible that large numbers of actors, whole crowds, armies, or university groups, form together one actant. An example of the coalescence of four distinct actants into two actors is, again, the conventional love story, in which the receiver is the longing lover himself and the power coalesces with the object: she “gives” herself.</p>
        <p>He: subject + receiver</p>
        <p>She: object + power</p>
        <p>The conventional nature of this plot becomes clear when we try to reverse it and fill both versions out further.</p>
        <p>On the basis of this analysis, one gains insight into the relations between the powers that form the foundation of the unreversed, conventional version. Seen grammatically, the active subject is passive in his role of receiver: he must wait and see whether he will receive the desired object. On the other hand, the passive object is also subject, and therefore more autonomous, in the role of power. The apparently passive object actant is, as power, the decisive factor in the background. The forces have been equally divided over the two actors. An inversion of roles would, therefore, not mean an inversion of power and would give no reason for the “he” to panic. But the plot changes as soon as the actant “power” is placed elsewhere. The symmetry is gone, and the development of the plot depends on the collusion or lack of it between subject and power. The examples of the previous sections may now be expanded:</p>

        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Helper and Opponent</em></strong></p>
        <p>The categories discussed so far are directly geared to the object, which is object both of desire and of communication. Both relations are necessary for the development of a fabula. But a fabula based on merely these two relations would end very soon: the subject wants something and either gets it or not. Usually the process is not so simple. The aim is difficult to achieve. The subject meets with resistance on the way and receives help. Thus the model distinguishes a third relation that determines the circumstances under which the enterprise is brought to an end.</p>
        <p>In analogy with the structure of the sentence, these two actants might be regarded as adverbial adjuncts. They are related to the object not by means of a verb, but rather through such things as prepositions (e.g., <em>owing to, notwithstanding</em>), to the function that connects subject with object. These actants are in many respects different from the others. They are in direct relation not to the object but to the function that connects subject with object. At first sight they do not appear necessary to the action. In practice, however, they are often rather numerous. They determine the various adventures of the subject, who must sometimes overcome great opposition before s/he can reach his or her goal.</p>
        <p>It is often difficult to agree on the difference between power and helper. The following points of difference may help to solve this difficulty:</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Power</em></p>
        <p>a Has power over the whole enterprise</p>
        <p>b Is often abstract</p>
        <p>c Often remains in the background</p>
        <p>d Usually only one</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Helper</em></p>
        <p>a Can give only incidental aid</p>
        <p>b Is mostly concrete</p>
        <p>c Often comes to the fore</p>
        <p>d Usually multiple</p>
        <p>The same points of difference can be pointed to between a negative power (i.e., a power who prevents the subject from reaching the object) and an opponent.</p>
        <p>Another issue concerns the reader’s sympathy or antipathy, since the relations between actants are not the same as those between actants and reader. The helper is not always the person who acts to bring about the ending desired by the reader. When the subject seems unsympathetic to the reader, the helper will, most likely, be so too; and the reader’s sympathy will go towards the opponent of the subject. When one confuses these two areas of relationship, one easily mistakes the division of forces. This is not to imply that sympathy must be eliminated from the reading experience, or from the analysis for that matter. On the contrary; it is, again, in the difference between actantial roles and reader’s response that the specific effect of the narrative’s fabula acquires relief and visibility.</p>
        <p>The examples may now be expanded. I provide only a sample of the many possibilities. In a, for instance, Mary’s father might be an opponent if he opposed the marriage; John’s good job, Mary’s determination, and an interceding aunt could be helpers. In b, several of Anna’s friends, social prejudice, her employer might be opponents; her best friend tries to give help, but this is not sufficient to reach her aim. In c, the several children, their curiosity, and the memories of Harold are opponents; the doctor and those among the children who keep silent, are helpers. In d and e, helpers of one are the opponents of the other: witnesses, meetings, circumstances that help bring about the solution, a button left on the scene of the murder, the murderer’s alcoholism, a talkative concierge, and more. In f, the proletariat is the helper and the bourgeoisie is the opponent. In g, the giant’s wife and boots are helpers; the nightfall, the birds who eat the crumbs, and the giant’s power of smell, which tell him that prey is near, are opponents. In h, every story Scheherezade tells is a helper, and the unremitting suspicion and jealousy of her husband are opponents.</p>
        <p>From these examples it becomes clear that each helper forms a necessary but in itself insufficient condition to reach the aim. Opponents must be overcome one by one, but such an act of overcoming does not guarantee a favourable ending: any moment a new opponent may loom. It is the presence of helpers and opponents that makes a fabula suspenseful and readable.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Further Specification</em></strong></p>
        <p>This model describes a structure – the relations between different kinds of phenomena – and not, primarily, the phenomena themselves. As we saw earlier, this model results in a numerical inequality of actors and actants. It is not surprising that one class of actors comprises more than one actor. The reverse, the fact that one actor stands for several classes, can only be understood if one disconnects the concept of actor from that of person: this is the reason why the term “person” is avoided when discussing actants and actors.</p>
        <p>I have already indicated some causes of the numerical inequality between actors and actants. The relationship between subject and object is the most important; it is the motor of the fabula. It can be aimed at the appropriation of someone, something, or, on the other hand, a quality in oneself. In the first case the object is a separate actor, in the second it is not. In the first case the relationship is objective, aimed at an outside object; in the second case the subject aims at (an aspect of) the subject itself; the relationship is subjective. In some cases, this entails the further splitting or merging of actors and actants. The merging of the power with the object and the receiver with the subject occurs with frequency. Power merges with subject when a character trait of the subject is of overriding importance. Perhaps we may take it as a rule of thumb that the greater the fabula’s orientation towards the actual outside world, the greater the number of actors; to the degree that the fabula is subjective, oriented towards the subject, the number of actors decreases.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Doubling</em></strong></p>
        <p>Some fabulas have different subjects who are in opposition: a subject and an anti-subject. An anti-subject is not an opponent. An opponent opposes the subject at certain moments of the pursuit of his or her aim. It is this incidental opposition that determines the structural position. An anti-subject pursues his or her own object, and this pursuit is, at a certain moment, at cross-purposes with that of the first subject. When an actant has his or her own program, his or her own aims, and acts to achieve these aims, s/he is an autonomous subject. It is also possible that a fabula has a second subject that does not come into opposition with the program of the first subject, but is entirely independent from it, or s/he may, consciously or not, give incidental aid or opposition to the achievement of the first subject’s aim. In that case there are moments in the fabula when the different lines touch or cross. The appearance of a separate subject indicates the existence of a subfabula. In Couperus’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em>, for instance, we might regard some of the children and grandchildren as autonomous subjects. In his struggle to become an artist, Lot needs self-analysis as a helper. This helper proves an opponent when Lot gains insight into the emotional predisposition of his heritage, and when his aims begin to conflict with those of the old people.</p>
        <p>It also happens that the power consists of two actants, one positive and the other negative. In naturalistic novels we often note the opposition of a personal willpower to social structure or heredity. It is likely that an extensive analysis of a number of naturalistic novels would give us as a characteristic result the opposition of two powers as a form of fabula intermediate between the subjective and the objective, between the one oriented towards the individual and the one directed towards the outside world.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Competence</em></strong></p>
        <p>If the process of the fabula can be seen as the execution of a program, then each execution presupposes the possibility of the subject to proceed. This possibility of the subject to act, the competence, may be of different kinds, which leads to further specification. Greimas subdivides competence into the determination or will of the subject to proceed to action, the power or possibility, and the knowledge or skill necessary to execute the aim. On this basis some critics have distinguished three different kinds of subjects. It makes sense to distinguish the phase of the fabula in which the virtual subject begins to desire the execution of the program; this phase might be seen as the introduction to the fabula. The distinction between power/possibility and knowledge/skill is a second principle of differentiation.</p>
        <p>The giants, witches, and wolves of the fairy tale are actants of the first category, Tom Thumb of the second one. It may have struck the reader that in the analysis of example g, the one of Tom Thumb, I have paid little attention to the giant. I have only mentioned his power of smell. It is evident, however, that the giant plays an important role in the fabula, more important than, for instance, his wife or Tom’s brothers. Merely classifying him as an opponent would be insufficient as a definition. He has his own program. He wants to find children and eat them. He reaches that goal in part: he finds children and eats them because he has the power to do so, owing to his physical force and size.</p>
        <p>Still, he does not fully reach his goal: he eats the wrong children. His program is at cross-purposes with that of Tom Thumb, who aims at a safe return home. The giant does not catch Tom Thumb and his brothers, because Tom Thumb possesses the second kind of competence, knowledge and skill in the form of cleverness. It would appear that in this example the specification coincides with the opposition between good and evil powers. In fairy tales this is certainly often the case. It also seems to apply to the classic detective story. Nevertheless, there is an important difference, especially in this respect. Examples d and e show that Kinsey Millhone and the murderer are in opposition. Millhone’s competence is one of skill and knowledge. However, so is that of the murderer; and it is in this respect that the detective story differs from the fairy tale. What characterizes the detective story is that the murderer fails in his or her competence: he makes a mistake. The detective novel has attempted to break through the opposition of good and evil, as for instance in the novels of the Swedish team of writers Sjowall and Wahloo. It is striking that, especially in those novels, the hitherto fixed division of competence should be broken. The detective often reaches his or her goal by accident or sometimes not at all, as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Closed Room</em>. The power then is not the detective’s insight, but fate or serendipity. In other instances, the detective reaches the aim through the manipulation of power. If, owing to his or her social position, the culprit is forced into such a tight corner that she is ripe and ready to give herself up to the detective, the latter only needs to dispose of the power to mobilize the police in order to reach his or her aim.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Truth Value</em></strong></p>
        <p>The final factor leading to further specification of actants is truth value. By truth value I mean the reality of the actants within the actantial structure. This specification is important not only with regard to the subject but also with regard to the helpers and opponents. Often they are only in appearance what they seem to be; in reality they prove the opposite. A traitor has the appearance of a helper but reveals him- or herself in the course of the story as an opponent. In the reverse case there are secret helpers: actors who help the subject, who believes s/he is dealing with an opponent; or an actor who seems to help the subject while the latter does not realize that this actor is not at all related to his or her own enterprise. Regarding this specification, certain categories of actors stand out: liars, master figures, false heroes, invisible fairies, but also seducers, truth-tellers, false clues, sudden moments of inspiration or misgiving that instigate the subject to take wrong decisions, and so on. The several possibilities are outlined in the following figure:</p>
        <p class="notranslate" translate="no">Picture/Diagram</p>
        <p>This figure shows the similarities and differences between the possible positions of actors with regard to fabula–internal truth. “Truth” consists in the coincidence of existence and appearance, of the identity and qualities of an actor on the one hand and the impression she makes, her claims, on the other. When an actor is what she appears, she is true. When she does not put up an appearance, or in other words hides who she is, this identity is secret. When he neither is nor puts up an appearance, he cannot exist as an actor; when he appears to be what he is not, this identity is a lie.</p>
        <p>Not only actants but also complete actantial schemes may be qualified as “true” or “false”. The frequent situation of the subject aspiring towards an illusory goal and finally realizing it might be accounted for in this way.</p>
        <p>To this aspect of actantial analysis we might also try to relate a typology. Fabulas that show the predominating influence of a secret in their actantial structure (e.g., certain fairy tales and myths) might be opposed as a separate category to fabulas in which a lie determines structure. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Of Old People</em> hinges on the structural principle of the secret. So do detective stories. In spy novels the concept of the lie predominates. This division into classes of actors helps us to interpret, to establish typologies to sharpen our definitions of literary movements, and to contrast fabulas that appear rather similar at first sight but prove different at vital points; it also allows us to compare the actantial structures of apparently widely different fabulas. An analysis of this type may show unexpected aspects of meanings.</p>
        <p>As with the analysis of events, there are many other possibilities for approaching the matter, which may or may not combine with our model. I briefly list a few below.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Other Divisions into Classes</em></strong></p>
        <p>In whatever way one regards literature, whether one values books as autonomous works of art, as products of an individual or group, as objects of communication, or as a specific form of a sign system, one can never escape the obvious fact that works of art and literature are made by, for, and (usually) about people. Relations between people themselves and between people and the world will therefore almost always be important in fabulas. It is possible to describe in every fabula at least one type of relation between actors that is of a psychological or ideological nature, or of both simultaneously. Each of these relations may give a specific content to the relation between subject and power, between subject and anti-subject, but they may also be studied separately from the actantial model. On the basis of the information about the actors contained in the text, one may group them according to those principles that seem important in the frame of reference of the fabula or groups of fabulas under analysis.</p>
        <p>First, psychological relations are of overriding importance in psychologically or psychoanalytically oriented criticism and determine the specification of actors into “psychic instances”. What does it mean when we say that one actor relates to another as daughter to mother, as father to son, or son to mother? Attempts have even been made to account for the difference between tragedy and comedy and their effects on the reader: in tragedy the son is guilty about the father, whom he unconsciously desires to replace; in comedy the father is guilty about the son and is consequently punished and replaced by the latter. In other cases, the relationship between man and wife, or between child and adult, or between strong and weak personalities attracts attention.</p>
        <p>Second, ideological relations occur, in addition to psychological relationships, in almost all fabulas. Whether it is the opposition between feudalism and liberalism, liberalism and socialism, patriarchy and feminism, colonialism and emancipation, or more specific oppositions, actors must always deal with the ideological oppositions of the world in which they move. The opposition between the individual and the collective, or between the individual and the representatives of power, is often of importance both in medieval romances and in nineteenth-century realist novels. In Kafka’s allegorical, modernist novels this opposition is even the primary thematic centre. Other oppositions, those of groups, result in ideological relationships: black against white, men against women, employers against employees, “haves” against “have-nots”, conformists against individualists, the “normal” against the “insane”. These oppositions demonstrate that not the categories as such but the categorization; not the differences but the structure of opposition itself is the ideological trap.</p>
        <p>Third, all kinds of different oppositions may become important on the basis of data that at first glance have no psychological or ideological foundation; on further consideration, it may become apparent that such data are linked to psychological or ideological oppositions. On the basis of physical appearance, groups may take shape, for example, fair versus dark or red-haired. In works of ideological fiction, such oppositions seem to coincide with the one between good and evil, thus conveying a racist ideology, or its parallel, the one between good-but-boring and excitingbut- evil. On the basis of past experience, heritage, possessions, relationships to third parties, age, and lifestyle, other groups may take shape that are often also related to psychological or ideological relationships.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">4: Time</h3>
        <p>Events have been defined as processes. A process is a change, a development, and presupposes therefore a succession in time or a chronology. The events themselves happen during a certain period of time, and they occur in a certain order. Some narratives make their point primarily by means of duration.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Duration</em></strong></p>
        <p>The fabula of “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Tom Thumb</span>” occupies a span of some three days. The first event, the overhearing of the parents’ intention to rid themselves of their expensive children, takes place at night. So does the gathering of pebbles. The expedition to the wood and the return journey occupy the day following that night. The next night – or, in some versions, a following night – at some indeterminate time, Tom Thumb again overhears his parents, and again tries to collect pebbles, but finds himself prevented from leaving the house. The night after that the children get lost and wander into the giant’s den. That night the giant eats his own children by mistake.</p>
        <p>The next day Tom Thumb and his brothers return home safely in possession of the seven-mile boots, which guarantee a fixed income that will preclude a repetition of the fabula in the future. The time span of this fabula forms one continuous whole, possibly with the exception of the first night, which may be regarded as a prelude to the fabula proper. In three days the family’s life changes substantially, from desperate poverty to happy prosperity. In “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Little Red Riding Hood</span>” the whole fabula occupies only half a day. The principle narrative of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Arabian Nights</em> presents a fabula that takes one season; that of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">War and Peace</em> takes many years. The fabula of the Old Testament lasts many centuries. The investigations of Kinsey Millhone, in Sue Grafton’s series, are, as a rule, finished in a few days, while Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple tend to take longer. Classical tragedy even has <em>rules</em> about time. The time span of its fabula, which should not extend beyond one day and one night, thus functions as an aesthetic criterion or, at least, as a differential criterion with regard to genre.</p>
        <p>This unity of time as a generic requirement remains restricted to classical tragedy. Time span is also significant in the fabulas of narrative texts. A first, general distinction might be the one between crisis and development: the first term indicates a short span of time into which events have been compressed, the second a longer period of time that shows a development. Neither of these two forms in itself has clear advantages over the other. It has sometimes been said that development is more realistic, more in accord with the experience of real life. This seems doubtful, to say the least. In reality too, moments of crisis present themselves, moments during which, in a brief instant of time, the life of a person or an entire nation takes a decisive turn. Furthermore, much depends on one’s personal taste in literature: some of us prefer greater verisimilitude than others. It does seem likely, however, that a preference for one of these forms entails a certain vision of the fabula and, often, of reality. It is likely, therefore, that such a form is meaningful in itself.</p>
        <p>Certain types of fabulas are specifically appropriate for one of the two types of duration and may even depend on a particular type. (Auto)biographies, <em>Bildungsromane</em>, war novels, frame narratives <em class="notranslate" translate="no">(Arabian Nights, Decameron)</em>, and travel histories require a fairly long time span – in these, the most important topic presented is precisely the passing of time. Other narrative texts, however, require a brief period of time, especially when a moment of crisis is being described. Many modern and contemporary novels and stories have been written in the crisis form. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">La modification</em> by Michel Butor and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Seize the Day</em> by Saul Bellow, two well-known representatives of new developments in the postwar novel, have in this respect been compared to classical tragedy. The fabula of Henry James’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Ambassadors</em> covers a period not of twenty-four hours but of several months, but one may see it as a crisis nevertheless.</p>
        <p>The distinction between crisis and development is relative: one form blends into the other. A fabula tends to a greater or lesser degree towards either one of the two forms. So it is often possible to distinguish both forms within one type of text. Sometimes, when this is the case, they can be considered characteristic of a certain sub-form or author, or developmental phase of the type. Earlier I suggested a difference between the detective novels of Sue Grafton and Agatha Christie. True, a more systematic analysis of their entire oeuvre would be needed to confirm the impression gained from a relatively small number of their novels. However, the preference for either crisis or development does not merely imply a certain vision of reality or a choice of a certain type of texts. Once selected, the two forms have implications for the construction of the fabula.</p>
        <p>1a A development may present, in historical order, as much material as seems fit. It is not by accident that these novels are usually rather long.</p>
        <p>1b The selection of the crisis form implies a restriction: only brief periods from the life of the actor are presented. In narrative painting the crisis is a privileged form for the obvious reason that a still image can accommodate only a limited number of events. What art historians call “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">the pregnant moment</span>” is the pictorial equivalent of a crisis. Such paintings represent a single moment, but one that can only be understood as following the past and announcing the future.</p>
        <p>2a In a development, the global significance is built up slowly from strings of events. The insights of the actors, and their relationships, take shape through the quality of events.</p>
        <p>2b In a crisis, the significance is central and informs what we might call the surrounding elements. The crisis is representative – that is, characteristic of the actors and their relationships.</p>
        <p>3a But a development, too, requires selection. It is not an entire lifetime that is presented, but parts from it; parts are skipped, abbreviated, summarized. From one novel to another we find great differences in this representation of the development.</p>
        <p>3b The crisis, too, hardly ever occurs in its ideal form. Corneille met with the reproach that his <em>Le Cid</em> was too crowded with events for a twenty-four-hour span; the fight against the Moors, in addition to all the other events, could not possibly have taken place in so brief a time. In narrative the basic form is more easily varied and diverged from. In a crisis this happens not primarily through summary, selection, or highlighting but rather through asides. Thus we find recollections. In this way the time span of <em>Of Old People</em> is extended from one season to sixty years. Or we encounter references to past and future: at the end of most fairy tales (“<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Tom Thumb</span>” is no exception), the future of the protagonist(s) is briefly alluded to. There is another kind of diversion that can also serve to extend the time span of the crisis form: a minor actor can become the protagonist in his own fabula; in this way a sub-fabula is created. These possibilities for extending the compass of the crisis and compressing the development are closely linked with the other aspect mentioned: that of chronology.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Chronology: Interruption and Parallelism</em></strong></p>
        <p>Techniques for varying the time sequence by means of elimination, or of condensation of duration, or of parallel development of several strands of the fabula, have a bearing on the chronology. Elimination causes gaps in the sequence of chronology. A period of time is skipped, often without being noticed by the reader. What has been eliminated? This is, of course, a nonsensical question. The fabula is, after all, nothing but the series of events that are mentioned. No one is likely to wonder what Tom Thumb’s profession will be or at what age he started to walk. Still, omitted events are often brought to the fore in other parts of the text. In this way ellipsis – the omission of an element that belongs in a series – gains its power of signification. Robbe-Grillet’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Voyeur</em> is, perhaps, the most spectacular example. In this novel an event that, according to further information given by the fabula, must certainly have taken place, is omitted. It would even seem the most important event of the entire fabula: the sadistic murder of a young girl by the protagonist. Throughout the fabula this actor, Mattias, labours to fill this gap in time, establishing an “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">innocent</span>” chronology. Until the very end it is not clearly evident that Mattias is the murderer. Consequently, the fabula cannot be fully described.</p>
        <p>Although it is not as central as in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le voyeur</em>, in other narrative texts ellipsis often has a significant function. The sentence “When they left Tostes, Madame Bovary was pregnant”, which is so characteristic of Flaubert’s narrative style, indicates by the ease with which it passes over the event that the getting, and later having, of children is of very slight importance to Emma Bovary, and the moment at which the child is conceived is of none at all. Indeed, the sexual relationship between Emma and Charles is, through the ellipsis of the event, fully represented as poor.</p>
        <p>The elaboration of parallel strings of one fabula makes it difficult to recognize one single chronological sequence in that fabula. Several events happen at the same time. It is not always possible to decide whether the coincidence in time is partial or complete. The vagueness of the chronology is, at times, just as significant as its painstaking representation. In Reve’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Evenings</em>, events happen exactly chronologically and this chronology is indicated with such accuracy that the suggestion arises of an obsession caused by a surplus of time.</p>
        <p>In Garcia Marquez’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> the strict sequence of events is undercut from the inside, and readers who want to keep track of the course of the fabula find themselves powerless in the face of the evermultiplying story lines, which make one hundred years into an eternity. Insofar as this effect is caused by changes, reversals in chronology, this problem belongs to chapter 2. What concerns me here is that incomplete information, which is never filled out, leaves gaps in the constructed fabula and thus blurs our impression of it. Also important here is the occurrence of parallelism, and the fact that achronicity, the impossibility of establishing a precise chronology, can be the result of the criss-crossing of several lines.</p>
        <p><strong><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Logical Sequence</em></strong></p>
        <p>Sequence is a logical concept. It is a matter of logic to suppose that someone who arrives must first have departed; that old age follows youth; reconciliation, quarrel; awakening, sleep. On the basis of the information offered in the text, it is possible to find the chronology of the fabula even if the order is not sequential. What is the point of doing so? Chronological sequences are to be distinguished from other logical sequences. It is a frequent misconception that chronological and causal connections are always interrelated. It is true, of course, that one can only kill, hate, or despise one’s father after having been engendered, although films like <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Back to the Future</em> suggest otherwise. Another ruling misconception is that what happens first is therefore better. For some people this has been a reason to proclaim the superiority of men over women, on the basis of the account of creation in Genesis 2; for others, on the basis of the same fragment, it has been a reason to denounce the account of creation as sexist. Both parties implicitly base their contention on the assumption that chronological priority entails a qualitative priority.</p>
        <p>But the Bible’s poetics do not at all encourage such an interpretation. The sequence of events in it mirrors the process of creation as an ongoing splitting and specifying, much like cells in the human body. Therefore, the first creation of “man” is rather the creation of an undivided, still elementary proto-human being, subsequently split into female – in fact mentioned first there – and male. Limiting the analysis to chronological connections helps us expose such misconceptions. This is the gain of structuralist analysis.</p>
        <p>The time span can be compared and contrasted with chronology. A brief event – for example, a meeting – succeeds a long event – for example, a process of estrangement between two actors. In this order the meeting has or might have another significance and other consequences than it would have had if the order had been inverted. When one orders the events in chronological sequence, one forms an impression of the difference between fabula and story. The interventions in chronology that become manifest can be significant for the vision of the fabula which they imply.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">5: Location</h3>
        <p>Events happen somewhere. The locations where things happen may in principle be deduced. When we read</p>
        <p>a John was pushing his shopping cart when he suddenly saw his hated neighbour at the checkout counter</p>
        <p>we may assume that the meeting place is the supermarket. b Elizabeth crossed the street</p>
        <p>indicates a street, whether narrow or wide, long or short. c Sighing with pleasure, he sank back into the pillows as she bent over him.</p>
        <p>This sentence, too, leaves little doubt about the location of action. When the location has not been indicated, readers will simply supply one. <em>They</em> will imagine the scene, and in order to do so, they have to situate it somewhere, however vague the imaginary place may be. The Russian semiotician Lotman has explained this by pointing out the predominance of the dimension of space in the human imagination. In support of his contention he lists a number of convincing examples of spatial terms we use to indicate abstract concepts, such as “infinite” for an “immeasurably” large quantity, and “distance” for a deficient relationship between people. Incidentally, even the word “relation” itself would seem to support Lotman’s contention.</p>
        <p>If spatial thinking is indeed a general human tendency, then it is not surprising that spatial elements play an important role in fabulas. It is, for instance, possible to make a note of the place of each fabula and then to see whether a connection exists between the kind of events, the identity of the actors, and the location. The subdivision of locations into groups is a means to gain insight into the relations between elements. A contrast between inside and outside is often relevant: inside may carry the suggestion of protection, and outside that of danger. These meanings are not indissolubly tied to these oppositions; it is equally possible for inside to suggest close confinement, and outside freedom, or for us to see a combination of these meanings, or a development from one to the other. Thus in Colette’s novel <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Cheri</em>, Lea’s bedroom is, at first, a safe haven for Cheri, but towards the end this place becomes a prison from which he escapes with barely concealed relief. The expectation that the home provides safety is a powerful trigger of suspense when the opposite is the case. And sadly, the issue of the sexual abuse of children has revealed how often the home is precisely the place of danger.</p>
        <p>Another opposition – a related one – is between the centrally located square, which functions as the meeting place where actors confront one another, and the surrounding world, where each actor has to fend for her- or himself. City and country are contrasted in many romantic and realistic novels. Emma Bovary’s idealization of the city, projected onto Paris, becomes the measure of her involvement, then disappointment, with a lover in Rouen, the only city to which she has access.</p>
        <p>The opposition between city and country can take on different meanings. Sometimes the former is the site of iniquity in contrast to the countryside’s idyllic innocence; or the former is a place to magically acquire riches, in contrast to the drudgery of farm labour; or the former is the seat of power over powerless country people. This contrast, too, may reverse itself when it becomes clear that the riches of the city are limited to a few and that the common man in the urban slums is worse off than the farmer, who can, at least, eat his own crops. Or, conversely, the city can be presented as a maddening place ruled by paranoia, in contrast to the peaceful, wholesome countryside. In the British TV series <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Upstairs Downstairs</em> the contrast between kitchen and drawing-room represents the radical difference between masters and servants. A public meeting place such as a pub may serve as neutral ground, lending it a social function: a meeting place for companions in adversity who may gain courage from sympathy and solidarity. But it may also be a place where one takes refuge in alcohol, leading to complete destruction, as in Zola’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L’Assommoir</em>.</p>
        <p>Spatial oppositions can be much more abstract than the examples mentioned here. When several places, ordered in groups, can be related to psychological, ideological, and moral oppositions, location may function as an important principle of structure. For instance, high– low, related to favourable–unfavourable, fortunate–unfortunate, is an opposition that Western literature has inherited from the late biblical vision of heaven and hell, and also from Latin and Greek mythology. Far–near, open–closed, and finite–infinite, together with familiar– strange, safe–unsafe, and accessible–inaccessible are oppositions often encountered.</p>
        <p>As I suggested in chapter 2, a special role is played by the boundary between two opposed locations. Just as in Christian mythology purgatory mediates the opposition between heaven and hell, so the front door may connote a crucial barrier for one intending to penetrate certain circles. The shop as a transitory place between outside and inside, the sea between society and solitude, the beach between land and sea, gardens between city and country, all function as mediators. It is possible to be trapped in such places.</p>
        <p>Many events are set in vehicles of transportation, such as trains, boats, carriages, and airplanes. Such events – murder in Agatha Christie, sex in Flaubert, meetings, quarrels, hold-ups – temporarily suspend the clarity and safe predictability of the social order. This structuring potential of places of transition nourishes the narrative potential of the road “<span class="notranslate" translate="no">Penetrante Ouest</span>” in Chamoiseau’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Texaco</em>. This road launches the fabula, yet in the end, it is never built. Rather than a connection, it would have been merely a “penetration” of the land. Its destructive capacity – for its construction, the entire site of Texaco would have had to be erased – makes it, and the fabula of appropriation it represented, unacceptable. The woman founder of the community of Texaco, Marie- Sophie, abducts the road: she tells the story that converts the urban planner and makes him give up on constructing the road and instead monumentalize the place as a site of memory.</p>
        <p>Oppositions are constructions; it is important to remember that so as not to naturalize them. As deconstructive criticism has amply demonstrated, oppositions are invariably flawed in their attempted logic. And that is very fortunate. If this chapter has relied more than the previous ones on the idea of opposition, this is not because oppositions have a privileged status in reality or art. Structuring often takes the route of opposition as a handy simplification of complex content. The oppositions we expect to function in fabulas can be traps as well as tools. This is the major problem of ideological and political criticism. The very ideological structure – binary opposition – that we use for our critical readings is simultaneously the object of those readings, their main target. The point is not to notice, confirm, or denounce oppositions but to confront the oppositions we notice with those we hold ourselves, and to use the differences between them as a tool to break their tyranny. When such an approach is taken, criticism need not prejudge the politics of great literature, or of popular culture, as happens so often. Instead, it helps us realize that criticism is always also, to a certain extent, self-criticism.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Remarks and Sources</h3>
        <p>In this chapter I have outlined objects and processes as the most important elements of the fabula. First events were discussed, then actors. I contend that these two categories are the most relevant elements. In both cases I first discussed criteria for selection on the basis of which a large quantity of subject matter might be restricted on explicit grounds. Subsequently the relationship between the remaining elements was considered. Events were always seen in relation to the actors forming part of them, and the actors in relation to the events they initiated or suffered. With regard to events I paid special attention to different criteria of selection, while in discussing the actors I was primarily engaged in classification. This difference relates to the order in which both subjects were discussed; it was not necessary to discuss again the several criteria for selection when that had been done in the previous subsection, albeit with regard to a different subject. Finally, time and location have been given only summary attention. They were discussed at greater length in the previous chapter, for these elements are primarily interesting because of the way in which they are ordered and specified in the story. The different subsections of this chapter show a clear resemblance. In every case I tried to describe the elements in their relationship to one another, and not as isolated units. This approach is structuralist: it assumes that fixed relations between classes of phenomena form the basis of the narrative system of the fabula. I chose this approach because it offers, among other advantages, that of coherence. The different elements may thus be seen within the framework of one theoretical approach. Objections may be raised against this approach. The one mentioned most often is that it is reductive. This is inevitable: every choice is a limitation. But if that limitation is a starting point, not an endpoint, it can be turned against itself and help us grasp what the ideological distributions of elements are and do. Instead of an ideological foundation, structural analysis then becomes a tool for critique.</p>
        <p>When dealing with determined relationships between classes of phenomena, the ordering principles that form the basis of these classes must be made explicit. Classification, however, is not a self-serving aim for the literary scholar. Its use is instrumental: only when classification helps achieve greater insight into the phenomena constituting the classes is it meaningful in describing the text. Then significance may be derived from the fact that a phenomenon belongs to a certain class. The specific characteristics of one object may be described in terms of the class to which they belong – or to which, against our expectation, they possibly do not belong. It is to emphasize that aspect of the approach that I have, in my examples, selected typological aspects just as often as specific texts. Typologies, however, are often handled implicitly: when one says that a text shows an original vision of society, one implicitly assumes that a certain outlook on society forms the basis of the class of texts to which that particular one belongs.</p>
        <p>On the resemblance or homology between fabulas and reality, the literature is vast. Suffice it here to refer to the classical study by Erich Auerbach (1953) that inaugurated a flurry of interest in this subject. A good later study is Prendergast (1986). Although it is not systematic enough to serve my purposes here, Peter Brooks’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Reading for the Plot</em> (1984) offers a meaningful supplement to the structural models presented here.</p>
        <p>The criteria for selecting events have been derived from Barthes (1975) and Hendricks (1973). The relations between events have been discussed according to the proposals of Bremond (1973). For a sophisticated application, see Bremond and Pavel (1998). Bremond distinguishes a third possibility for the combination of elementary series: juxtaposition. I have not included this possibility because to me it seems not of the same order as succession and embedding. Juxtaposition does not result in a complete series of events, but in several visions of one and the same event. This issue was dealt with in chapter 2. The actantial model as it is presented here is derived from Greimas (1966). While I find the demonstration of his model useful, I have not adopted his later proposal (e.g., 1976) to replace <em class="notranslate" translate="no">opponent</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">helper</em> with the concepts <em class="notranslate" translate="no">anti-actant</em> and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">co-actant</em>; the distinction between anti-subjects – autonomous subjects whose intentions are at cross-purposes with those of the first subject – and incidental opponents would be lost. I prefer to regard the duplication of the principal actant as a possibility and to maintain the original sixfold model. Most structural models have, to a greater or lesser degree, been inspired by Propp, whose work only became widely known during the 1960s. Lotman’s remarks on location are published in Lotman (1973). I already mentioned De Lauretis’s (1983) feminist critique of this view. Fludernik (1996) offers a thorough discussion of the issues in this book, including the topics of this chapter, which motivated students might find interesting. For what can be considered a “postcolonial” reflection that bears on the way I propose to use narratological models, see Melas (2007). The example of the biblical creation story was treated extensively in my book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lethal Love</em> (1987). Another example of the use of narratology for anthropology is Elsbee (1982).</p>
