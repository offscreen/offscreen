        <h2 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound</h2>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">A Tragic Prophecy</h3>
        <p>Being a prophet is a hard fate. At times a prophet can go on living and working only if he does not believe in his own prophecies. When the technique of the sound film struck the first blow at the art of the silent film, I said that it would destroy the already highly developed culture of the silent film. I added that this would be only temporary, until expression by means of sound would have developed to a higher level. I said that what had happened was a catastrophe, the like of which had never occurred before in the history of any other art. But I also said that a return to the silent film was impossible, for the evolution of technique is the evolution of the productive forces of mankind and the dangers it brings in its train cannot be averted by hampering its development. That would be senseless machine-wrecking. We cannot protect people from impending suffering by killing them.</p>
        <p>When nearly two decades ago the first attempts at a sound film were shown, I wrote in my book <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Der Geist des Films</em> that sound was not yet a gain for the film, but merely a task which would be an immense gain once it was fulfilled. This would be when film sound would be as docile and adaptable a medium as the film picture already was; when the sound strip will have turned from a technique of reproduction to a creative art, as the picture strip had already done.</p>
        <p>Now, two decades later, I must repeat word for word the relevant chapter from <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Der Geist des Films</em>. What I then foretold as a threat, is now already accomplished fact. On the other hand what we hoped and expected from the sound film  has not been fulfilled. The art of the silent film is dead, but its place was taken by the mere technique of the sound film which in twenty years has not risen and evolved into an art. On the whole the film has reverted again to a speaking photographed theatre. No question but that it is often very well photographed very good theatre. The development of the new technique has served the old art well. But the new technique has not like the silent film developed into a new art, revealing new spheres of human experience and based on new principles. I said ‘on the whole’. For there have been and are certain signs that the independent acoustic manifestation of the sound film is not dead yet and that this abortive great possibility of human culture, this potentiality is still seeking its own forms of expression and has broken through now and then between the pores of some recent films.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Blind Alley</h3>
        <p>Was an almost useless standstill of nearly two decades really necessary in order to prove by drastic experience the correctness of this forecast? Did we have to pass along this blind alley in order to convince ourselves that it is a blind alley? Well, I believe in the continuity of development. I believe that even this was not time lost. It is the job of the theoretician to discover whether this standstill was not apparent only. But only a resumed development will be able to show what it owes to the past.</p>
        <p>It is certain that in the reviving film culture of a Europe recovering from the second world war, the dissatisfaction with the sound film in its present state has become so universally felt that the voice of the theoretician may now meet with a better response. The time has come for an art of the sound ifilm and hence the time has also come for a theory that is still valid to-day to attempt to render conscious and transform into will and purpose something that is now merely an instinctive urge.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Prophecy</h3>
        <p>Two decades ago I wrote: Tn its last years the German film really began to develop rapidly. But then another departure, the sound film, stopped it before it had progressed more than half-way. The picture camera had only just started to acquire sensitive nerves and an imagination of its own. The art of set-up, viewpoint, angle and editing had just reached the stage where it could overcome the material resistance of primitive objectivity. The silent film was just about to develop a psychological subtlety and creative power almost unrivalled in any other art. Then the invention of the sound film came down on it like a landslide. The whole rich culture of the silent film which I have described in the preceding chapters, is now in danger. An undeveloped medium of expression, hitched to a highly developed one, will drag the latter back to a rudimentary condition. And it is inevitable that with the lowering of the level of expression the level of content will equally deteriorate.</p>
        <p>‘But in history there are no mortal tragedies, only crises, in matters which concern the whole human race. This, too, is a new road which has blocked up the old. In the economic sphere, too, every great new technical invention brought crises and catastrophes—but nevertheless served the advancement of humanity.</p>
        <p>Tn art every technical innovation is an inspiration. Opportunity is the true muse. It was not the painters who invented paint, and hammer and chisel were necessities before men began to carve statues. The cinematographic camera, too, was in existence before it occurred to someone to use it as the instrument of a new art and a new culture. The instrument must precede the artistic purpose it awakens. Only after such an awakening does the dialectical process of development begin, in which the now conscious purpose seeks more new technical possibilities of expression. From this point onwards it is art that determines the direction and tasks of technical development in accordance with its own needs. Why do the first sound films strike us as ridiculous and embarrassing “Kitsch”? Because we already judge by the standards not of their present performance but of their possibilities and promise. Our aversion signifies not rejection but an impatient demand.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">What Do We Demand?</h3>
        <p>Tt is this demand which grants recognition to the sound film as a new great art. The demand is that the sound film should not merely contribute sound to the silent film and thus make it even more like nature, but that it should approach the reality of life from a totally different angle and open up a new treasure-house of human experience. We do not as yet demand from the incipient sound film any technical perfection of performance, but we do demand new themes. What interests us in the first place is not how it sounds, but what it is that it endows with the power of vocal expression.</p>
        <p>Tor if the sound film will merely speak, make music and imitate sounds as the theatre has already done for some thousands of years, then even at the peak of its technical perfection it will remain nothing but a copying device. But in art only that counts for a discovery which discovers, reveals something hitherto hidden from our eyes—or ears.</p>
        <p>‘The silent film, when it became an art, discovered for us an unknown visual world. It showed us the face of things, the mimicry of nature and the microdramatics of physiognomy. In the sequence of shots produced by editing a hitherto hidden interrelation of figures and movements was revealed to us and the linking of pictures evoked new powerful trains of association.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Acoustic World</h3>
        <p>‘It is the business of the sound film to reveal for us our acoustic environment, the acoustic landscape in which we live, the speech of things and the intimate whisperings of nature; all that has speech beyond human speech, and speaks to us with the vast conversational powers of life and incessantly influences and directs our thoughts and emotions, from the muttering of the sea to the din of a great city, from the roar of machinery to the gentle patter of autumn rain on a window-pane. The meaning of a floor-board creaking in a deserted room, a bullet whistling past our ear, the death-watch beetle ticking in old furniture and the forest spring tinkling over the stones. Sensitive lyrical poets always could hear these significant sounds of life and describe them in words. It is for the sound film to let them speak to us more directly from the screen.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Discovery Of Noise</h3>
        <p>‘The sounds of our day-to-day fife we hitherto perceived merely as a confused noise, as a formless mass of din, rather as an unmusical person may listen to a symphony; at best he may be able to distinguish the leading melody, the rest will fuse into a chaotic clamour. The sound film will teach us to analyse even chaotic noise with our ear and read the score of life’s symphony. Our ear will hear the different voices in the general babble and distinguish their character as manifestations of individual life. It is an old maxim that art saves us from chaos. The arts differ from each other in the specific kind of chaos which they fight against. The vocation of the sound film is to redeem us from the chaos of shapeless noise by accepting it as expression, as significance, as meaning’.</p>
        <p>Twenty years have passed since I wrote down these conditions. The sound film has left them unfulfilled to this day. The arts did not accede to my theoretical wishes. During its evolution the human spirit has had many a fair prospect open up before it, which the great highroad of human culture then bypassed and left behind. No art exploits all its possibilities, and not only aesthetic factors influence the choice of the road that is ultimately followed in preference to many possible others. And I would not have repeated this my old demand if the sound film had since advanced farther along another road. But it has advanced nowhere. What twenty years ago was opportunity and perspective, is still perspective and opportunity today. I quote:</p>
        <blockquote>‘Only when the sound film will have resolved noise into its elements, segregated individual, intimate voices and made them speak to us separately in vocal, acoustic close-ups; when these isolated detail-sounds will be collated again in purposeful order by sound-montage, will the sound film have become a new art. When the director will be able to lead our ear as he could once already lead our eye in the silent film and by means of such guidance along a series of close-ups will be able to emphasize, separate and bring into relation with each other the sounds of life as he has done with its sights, then the rattle and clatter of life will no longer overwhelm us in a lifeless chaos of sound. The sound camera will intervene in this chaos of sound, form it and interpret it and then it will again be man himself who speaks to us from the sound screen.</blockquote>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dramaturgy Of Sound</h3>
        <p>The genuine sound film which has a style of its own will not be satisfied with making audible the speech of human beings, which in the past has been only visible, nor will it rest content with an acoustic presentation of events. Sound will not merely be a corollary to the picture, but the subject, source and mover of the action. In other words it will become a dramaturgical element in the film. For instance, sounds will not merely be an accompaniment to a duel but possibly its cause as well. The audible clash of blades may be of less importance—because devoid of a dramaturgical function—than perhaps a song heard coming from a garden by the listening rivals and occasioning a quarrel between them. Such sounds would be essential elements of the story. There is no reason why a sound should be less apt to provoke action than a sight would be.’</p>
        <p>The first sound films were still intent on exploiting these special possibilities of sound. At that time a film operetta was made in Berlin. In it a young composer absolutely has to produce a new valse before the end of the coming day. He racks his brains and can find nothing suitable. Then through a mistake an unknown girl comes to his room. The result of the sudden and unexpected adventure is the birth of a valse. The composer plays it on the piano and the girl sings it. But the musician’s unknown muse vanishes as she had come and the composer again forgets the tune which he had no time to write down. Only the unknown girl might possibly remember it. So the composer puts a want ad. in the paper: ‘The young lady, who . . .’ After some naive, even inane complications all turning on the melody, the valse finally brings the lovers together again. Here was a proper plot for a sound film. The found, lost and recovered valse had a dramaturgical, action-moving part to play.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Speaks Up</h3>
        <p>In the story mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the lost and found melody was, however, allotted a role such as might have been played by any other object. It was a mere ‘prop’ in the weft of the dramatic plot, no different than a ring or a document which might have been lost and found and around which the plot might have been woven just as well. The valse in this case is merely presented as a fact; no significance attaches to its specific acoustic quality and effect. For this reason it is the most superficial form in which sound can be given a dramaturgical function in a story.</p>
        <p>Deeper and more organic is the dramaturgical role of sound when its effect determines the course of the action; when sound is not only made to be heard in the course of the story but can intervene to influence its course. I take an instance from an old silent film, or rather I am inventing an instance in order that fight might be thrown on yet another problem in the same sphere.</p>
        <p>In the early days of the silent film, a film was made about Paganini, with Conrad Veidt in the title role. The wizard fiddler is put in prison but he fiddles himself out again. His playing is bewitching—the enchanted turnkeys get out of his path and his violin paralyses all resistance to his escape. The crowd outside, charmed by his music, opens a path for the fiddler and his fiddle.</p>
        <p>In this film the inaudible playing of a violin had a dramaturgical function, because it influenced the hero’s fate, freed him from his prison. As a spectacle it was a fine and convincing scene, precisely because it was silent! The dumbshow of a great actor made us imagine violin-playing so enchanting that hardened jailers dropped their weapons. How great a virtuoso would have been required to play the violin in a sound film in order to achieve this? A merely visible, inaudible music, existing only in the imagination, could have a magic effect. The effect of actually heard music would depend on the public’s musical sensibility and taste, a quantity susceptible of innumerable variations. But to make it credible that music did actually charm the rough jailers, it would have to have a like effect on the whole of the audience. It is not by chance that the sound film has not yet touched the Paganini theme.</p>
        <p><em class="notranslate" translate="no">Petersburg Night</em>, made by the Russian Grigori Roshal, also has a musician hero. Here the varying effect on the audience is not due to the quality of the playing, but to the nature of the music played. The Russian violinist plays folk songs and the society ladies and gentlemen in the best seats do not like it and boo, while the poorer patrons in the gallery are enthusiastic. Just as the scene mentioned in connection with the Paganini film was possible only in a silent film, so the scene from the Russian film is possible only in a sound film, for we must hear the songs and experience their spirit in order to know why they delight one part of the audience and infuriate the other. This scene characterizes not only the music but the audience listening to it and in addition to its dramaturgical function, it also has a profound ideological significance.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sounds As Dramatis Personae</h3>
        <p>But not only music can have a dramaturgical function in a sound film. For instance: a sailor is saying good-bye to his family. His wife, rocking a cradle, begs him to stay at home. But the sea, the great rival for his affections, is visible through the window. The sailor hesitates. Then two sounds are heard, like two rival seducers. A soft lullaby sung by the woman and the summoning murmur of the sea. In the picture one now sees only the sailor, and of him only his face, but it shows the conflict in his mind, the hard struggle within himself, evoked by these two sounds, these two calls. It is a dramatic, fate-deciding scene in which not a word is spoken. The woman’s lullaby and the voice of the sea fight a duel here for possession of a soul.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Influence Of Accompanying Music</h3>
        <p>Sometimes the dramaturgical role of sound is indirect. A soldier is taking leave from a girl. The battlefield is near and the noise of bursting shells can be heard. The scene of leavetaking might have been shot without acoustic accompaniment. But it would certainly have taken a different turn. For the girl, starting at every shell-burst, influenced by the pictures conjured up by the danger, makes admissions which she would certainly not have made in a comfortable, safe, cosy room, or possibly not even have become conscious of them at all.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">A Battle Of Sounds</h3>
        <p>The young film production of Italy uses very fine, interesting dramaturgical sound effects, showing thereby once more that it is in the first rank of those who are now striving to recreate the film as an art. In Luigi Zampa’s excellent anti-Fascist film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Vivere in pace</em> the great central scene is built upon purely acoustic effects. A German corporal comes to the house of the Italian peasant who is harbouring a wounded American negro soldier. The negro must be hidden away quickly. In their hurry they can find no better place than the wine-cellar. The German is feeling very comfortable, however, and stays on and on and cannot be induced to go. He asks for food and drink. He wants to have a good time. The Italian peasant and his family sit silent and yawning, trying to get rid of the German by boredom. But suddenly funny noises are heard from the wine-cellar. The negro, tired of being shut up in the cold and dark, has broached a cask of wine and got drunk. The German pricks up his ears. Suddenly the Italian peasants break into noisy cheerfulness, in order to drown the dangerous noise. The drunken negro smashes up everything in the cellar. The gentle, sober old peasant and his elderly wife begin to shout songs, yell, and dance and drag the German into a noisy debauch. They compete desperately with the noises from the cellar. What follows is a battle between noises, a diabolical scene, which grows all the more exciting as the negro who has run amok in the cellar, is trying to get out of there and is kicking and battering at the door. The shadow of death falls on the breathless, feverish merriment. Finally the negro breaks down the door and the revelry, as if cut in two, suddenly freezes into mute stiff immobility.</p>
        <p>Even more moving is Vergano’s sound scene in the film <em class="notranslate" translate="no">II Sole Sorge Ancora</em>. A priest, a member of the Resistance who has been condemned to death is being taken to the scene of execution by the Germans. A crowd collects along the road. The crowd grows even larger, the ring surrounding the priest ever denser. The priest begins to pray, first softly, then more loudly, as he walks along. The camera follows with a tracking shot. The priest remains visible all the time, but of the crowd never more than two or three faces are seen, as the priest and the camera pass them. The priest is reciting the litany. Two or three of the crowd whisper the response : ‘Ora pro nobis’. But as the priest walks on and on, the response grows ever louder. We see not more than two or three people, but we hear ever more and more, in an ominous <em>crescendo</em>. The shot remains a close-up all the time and can show no crowd, but more and more voices say ‘Ora pro nobis’. We hear the swelling of the sound like the roaring of a torrent. It is the audible revolt of the people; its menacing power and emotion turns into a formidable acoustic symbol, precisely because we cannot see the crowd. If we saw the crowd, then the storm of voices would be explained, for the voices of so many people could scarcely be less loud. But then the sound would lose its particular significance. For never could the film show a crowd of such a size as the crowd the presence of which we are made to feel in that isolated, symbolic sound not contained by any real space. This is the voice of the nation and nevertheless we hear it in the close-up of the martyr-priest, as an answer to the mute play of his features.</p>
        <p>I do not say that such a decisive dramaturgical role of sound is indispensable for every sound film. As the silent film has ceased to exist, the sound film must operate with many different kinds of stories. The sound film to-day is not a specific form of film, but the whole of what there is of the film and hence the specific style of one sort of film cannot be obligatory for it. It must present everything that comes along. Nevertheless it is a pity that the sound film has almost completely dropped the cultivation of sound effects.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Problem Of The Sound Play</h3>
        <p>This is a good opportunity to discuss the form problem of the sound play in general. Wireless plays are impossible without verbal explanations and descriptions of the scene. We cannot understand even words in their exact sense if we cannot see the facial expression and gestures of those who speak. For the spoken word contains only a fragment of human expression. People talk not only with their mouths. The glance, a twitching of a muscle in the face, movements of the hands speak at the same time and only all of them together add up to the exact shade of meaning intended. The word is merely one of the tones in a rich chord, so we do not understand even the word in its precise meaning if we cannot see who said it and when, in what circumstances and connection. As for the sounds of nature we know them so little that we often fail even to recognize them unless we see what is emitting them. A farmhouse may at a pinch be represented by voices of animals. But even then the listener will not be able to say whether the mooing of cows, neighing of horses, crowing of cocks, cackling of hens, barking of dogs is a sound picture of some bucolic farm or of a livestock market. Even recognizable sounds merely indicate the generality of the things they stand for. But the life of all image-art is in the concrete, exact presentation of the individuality of things.</p>
        <p>But the rustling of a forest or the noise of the sea cannot always be distinguished—in fact the rustling of paper or the dragging of a sack along a stone floor are deceptively similar to both. Our ear is not yet sufficiently sensitive. It is the sound film that will train it, just as the silent film trained our eye. A hunter would recognize sounds in the forest which the citydweller would not. But on the whole most of us would not even find our way about in our own homes if we had to rely on our ears alone.</p>
        <p>For this reason radio plays always explain in one way or another what we are supposed to see, so that the sounds in it are merely acoustic illustrations of a narrated scene or a scene made intelligible by words.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Picture Forms The Sound</h3>
        <p>In a sound film there is no need to explain the sounds. We see together with the word the glance, the smile, the gesture, the whole chord of expression, the exact nuance. Together with the sounds and voices of things we see their physiognomy. The noise of a machine has a different colouring for us if we see the whirling machinery at the same time. The sound of a wave is different if we see its movement. Just as the shade and value of a colour changes according to what other colours are next to it in a painting, so the <em>timbre</em> of a sound changes in accordance with the physiognomy or gesture of the visible source of the sound seen together with the sound itself in a sound film in which acoustic and optical impressions are equivalently linked together into a single picture.</p>
        <p>In a radio play the stage has to be described in words, because sound alone is not space-creating.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Silence</h3>
        <p>Silence, too, is an acoustic effect, but only where sounds can be heard. The presentation of silence is one of the most specific dramatic effects of the sound film. No other art can reproduce silence, neither painting nor sculpture, neither literature nor the silent film could do so. Even on the stage silence appears only rarely as a dramatic effect and then only for short moments. Radio plays cannot make us feel the depths of silence at all, because when no sounds come from our set, the whole performance has ceased, as we cannot see any silent continuation of the action. The sole material of the wireless play being sound, the result of the cessation of sound is not silence but just nothing.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Silence And Space</h3>
        <p>Things that we see as being different from each other, appear even more different when they emit sounds. They all sound different when they do this, but they are all silent in the same way. There are thousands of different sounds and voices, but the substance of silence appears one and the same for all. That is at first hearing. Sound differentiates visible things, silence brings them closer to each other and makes them less dissimilar. Every painting shows this happy harmony, the hidden common language of mute things conversing with each other, recognizing each others’ shapes and entering into relations with each other in a composition common to them all. This was a great advantage the silent film had over the sound film. For its silence was not mute; it was given a voice in the background music, and landscapes and men and the objects surrounding them were shown on the screen against this common musical background. This made them speak a common silent language and we could feel their irrational conversation in the music which was common to them all.</p>
        <p>But the silent film could reproduce silence only by roundabout means. On the theatrical stage cessation of the dialogue does not touch off the great emotional experience of silence, because the space of the stage is too small for that, and the experience of silence is essentially a space experience.</p>
        <p>How do we perceive silence? By hearing nothing? That is a mere negative. Yet man has few experiences more positive than the experience of silence. Deaf people do not know what it is. But if a morning breeze blows the sound of a cock crowing over to us from the neighbouring village, if from the top of a high mountain we hear the tapping of a woodcutter’s axe far below in the valley, if we can hear the crack of a whip a mile away—then we are hearing the silence around us. We feel the silence when we can hear the most distant sound or the slightest rustle near us. Silence is when the buzzing of a fly on the window-pane fills the whole room with sound and the ticking of a clock smashes time into fragments with sledgehammer blows. The silence is greatest when we can hear very distant sounds in a very large space. The widest space is our own if we can hear right across it and the noise of the alien world reaches us from beyond its boundaries. A completely soundless space on the contrary never appears quite concrete, and quite real to our perception; we feel it to be weightless and unsubstantial, for what we merely see is only a vision. We accept seen space as real only when it contains sounds as well, for these give it the dimension of depth.</p>
        <p>On the stage, a silence which is the reverse of speech may have a dramaturgical function, as for instance if a noisy company suddenly falls silent when a new character appears; but such a silence cannot last longer than a few seconds, otherwise it curdles as it were and seems to stop the performance. On the stage, the effect of silence cannot be drawn out or made to last.</p>
        <p>In the film, silence can be extremely vivid and varied, for although it has no voice, it has very many expressions and gestures. A silent glance can speak volumes; its soundlessness makes it more expressive because the facial movements of a silent figure may explain the reason for the silence, make us feel its weight, its menace, its tension. In the film, silence does not halt action even for an instant and such silent action gives even silence a living face.</p>
        <p>The physiognomy of men is more intense when they are silent. More than that, in silence even things drop their masks and seem to look at you with wide-open eyes. If a sound film shows us any object surrounded by the noises of everyday life and then suddenly cuts out all sound and brings it up to us in isolated close-up, then the physiognomy of that object takes on a significance and tension that seems to provoke and invite the event which is to follow.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Dramaturgical Function Of Sound In The Shot</h3>
        <p>If dramaturgy is the teaching about the laws of dramatic action, is it possible to speak about dramaturgy in connection with a single shot? Does not the most energetic action manifest itself only in the sequence, in the interrelation of varying conditions following each other? Well, the film has nothing to do with the classic problem of the ancient Greek philosophers who asked whether movement consisted of a series of distinct conditions and whether a series of static conditions could ever become motion. For although each frame of the film is a snapshot of a separate motionless condition, our eye does not perceive it so. What we see is motion. The motion picture is what it is because even the shortest shot shows movement. The smallest particle of action, be it internal or external action, is always action, the optical manifestation of which is movement—even within one and the same shot. This is how it strikes our senses and our consciousness, and this is what matters in art. The specific task of the film is to seize on and localize by means of close-ups the very instants when the decisive, initiating or direction-changing impulses enter the action.</p>
        <p>However extensive an event is, however vast its scale, there has somewhere been some small spark which was the immediate cause of the explosion; a pebble must have loosened somewhere and started the landslide. These dramaturgically decisive particles of time can be presented by the film in a single shot. It can show the one man on whom it all turned, at the very instant which matters: that last-but-one second of hesitation in a glance of the eye, the one gesture in which the final resolve manifests itself. All this the film can separate by a close-up from the more general picture of the scene in which the causal course of the whole process is shown from begining to end. In such fatal decisive close-ups sound, too, can play a cardinal dramaturgical part.</p>
        <p>Moments when a man is alerted by a slight noise, or hears a word, may be of fatal significance. The close-up will show the face and let us hear the sound too. It will show the drama enacted on the face and at the same time let us hear its cause and explanation. This is done in two planes, with counterpointed effects.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound-Explaining Pictures</h3>
        <p>Not only the microdramatics expressed in the microphysiognomy of the face can be made intelligible by the sound which causes it. Such a close-up-plus-sound can have the inverse effect. The close-up of a listener’s face can explain the sound he hears. We might perhaps not have noticed the significance of some sound or noise if we had not seen its effect in the mirror of a human face. For instance we hear the screaming of a siren. Such a sound does not acquire a dramatic significance unless we can see from the expression on human faces that it is a danger-signal, or a call to revolt. We may hear the sound of sobbing, but how deep its meaning is will become evident only from the expression of sympathy and understanding appearing on some human face. Further, the acoustic character of a sound we understand is different too. We hear the sound of a siren differently if we know that it is a warning of impending deadly peril.</p>
        <p>The face of a man listening to music may also show two kinds of things. The reflected effect of the music may throw light into the human soul; it may also throw light on the music itself and suggest by means of the listener’s facial expression some experience touched off by this musical effect. If the director shows us a close-up of the conductor while an invisible orchestra is playing, not only can the character of the music be made clear by the dumbshow of the conductor, his facial expression may also give an interpretation of the sounds and convey it to us. And the emotion produced in a human being by music and demonstrated by a close-up of a face can enhance the power of a piece of music in our eyes far more than any added decibels.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Asynchronous Sound</h3>
        <p>In a close-up in which the surroundings are not visible, a sound that seeps into the shot sometimes impresses us as mysterious, simply because we cannot see its source. It produces the tension arising from curiosity and expectation. Sometimes the audience does not know what the sound is they hear, but the character in the film can hear it, turn his face towards the sound and see its source before the audience does. This handling of picture and sound provides rich opportunities for effects of tension and surprise.</p>
        <p>Asynchronous sound (that is, when there is discrepancy between the things heard and the things seen in the film) can acquire considerable importance. If the sound or voice is not tied up with a picture of its source, it may grow beyond the dimensions of the latter. Then it is no longer the voice or sound of some chance thing, but appears as a pronouncement of universal validity. I already mentioned the ‘Ora pro nobis’ in that fine Italian film, which grows into such a storm of popular protest and indignation in the close-ups, that a picture of even the vastest crowd that could be photographed would only diminish the effect. The surest means by which a director can convey the pathos or symbolical significance of sound or voice is precisely to use it asynchronously.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Intimacy Of Sound</h3>
        <p>Acoustic close-ups make us perceive sounds which are included in the accustomed noise of day-to-day life, but which we never hear as individual sounds because they are drowned in the general din. Possibly they even have an effect on us but this effect never becomes conscious. If a close-up picks out such a sound and thereby makes us aware of its effect, then at the same time its influence on the action will have been made manifest.</p>
        <p>On the stage such things are impossible. If a theatrical producer wanted to direct the attention of the audience to a scarcely audible sigh, because that sigh expresses a turningpoint in the action, then all the other actors in the same scene would have to be very quiet, or else the actor who is to breathe the sigh would have to be brought forward to the footlights. All this, however, would cause the sigh to lose its essential character, which is that it is shy and retiring and must remain scarcely audible. As in the silent film so in the sound film, scarcely perceptible, intimate things can be conveyed with all the secrecy of the unnoticed eavesdropper. Nothing need be silenced in order to demonstrate such sounds for all to hear—and they can yet be kept intimate. The general din can go on, it may even drown completely a sound like the soft piping of a mosquito, but we can get quite close to the source of the sound with the microphone and with our ear and hear it nevertheless.</p>
        <p>Subtle associations and interrelations of thoughts and emotions can be conveyed by means of very low, soft sound effects. Such emotional or intellectual linkages can play a decisive dramaturgical part. They may be anything—the ticking of a clock in an empty room, a slow drip from a burst pipe or the moaning of a little child in its sleep.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Cannot Be Isolated</h3>
        <p>In such close-ups of sound we must be careful, however, to bear in mind the specific nature of sound which never permits sound to be isolated from its acoustic environment as a closeup shot can be isolated from its surroundings. For what is not within the film frame cannot be seen by us, even if it is immediately beside the things that are. Light or shadow can be thrown into the picture from outside and the outline of a shadow can betray to the spectator what is outside the frame but still in the same sector of space, although the picture will show only a shadow. In sound things are different. An acoustic environment inevitably encroaches on the close-up shot and what we hear in this case is not a shadow or a beam of light, but the sounds themselves, which can always be heard throughout the whole space of the picture, however small a section of that space is included in the close-up. Sounds cannot be blocked out.</p>
        <p>Music played in a restaurant cannot be completely cut out if a special close-up of say two people softly talking together in a corner is to be shown. The band may not always be seen in the picture, but it will always be heard. Nor is there any need to silence the music altogether in order that we may hear the soft whispering of the two guests as if we were sitting in their immediate vicinity. The close-up will contain the whole acoustic atmosphere of the restaurant space. Thus we will hear not only the people talking, we will also hear in what relation their talking is to the sounds all round them. We will be able to place it in its acoustic environment.</p>
        <p>Such sound-pictures are often used in the film for the purpose of creating an atmosphere. Just as the film can show visual landscapes, so it can show acoustic landscapes, a tonal <em>milieu</em>.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Educating The Ear</h3>
        <p>Our eye recognizes things even if it has seen them only once or twice. Sounds are much more difficult to recognize. We know far more visual forms than sound forms. We are used to finding our way about the world without the conscious assistance of our hearing. But without sight we are lost. Our ear, however, is not less sensitive, it is only less educated than our eye. Science tells us in fact that the ear can distinguish more delicate nuances than our eye. The number of sounds and noises a human ear can distinguish runs into many thousands— far more than the shades of colour and degrees of light we can distinguish. There is however a considerable difference between perceiving a sound and identifying its source. We may be aware that we are hearing a different sound than before, without knowing to whom or what the sound belongs. We may have more difficulty in perceiving things visually, but we recognize them more easily once we have perceived them. Erdmann’s experiments showed that the ear can distinguish innumerable shades and degrees in the noise of a large crowd, but at the same time it could not be stated with certainty whether the noise was that of a merry or an angry crowd.</p>
        <p>There is a very considerable difference between our visual and acoustic education. One of the reasons for this is that we so often see without hearing. We see things from afar, through a windowpane, on pictures, on photographs. But we very rarely hear the sounds of nature and of life without seeing something. We are not accustomed therefore to draw conclusions about visual things from sounds we hear. This defective education of our hearing can be used for many surprising effects in the sound film. We hear a hiss in the darkness. A snake? A human face on the screen turns in terror towards the sound and the spectators tense in their seats. The camera, too, turns towards the sound. And behold the hiss is that of a kettle boiling on the gas-ring.</p>
        <p>Such surprising disappointments may be tragic too. In such cases the slow approach and the slow recognition of the sound may cause a far more terrifying tension than the approach of something seen and therefore instantly recognized. The roar of an approaching flood or landslide, approaching cries of grief or terror which we discern and distinguish only gradually, impress us with the inevitability of an approaching catastrophe with almost irresistible intensity. These great possibilities of dramatic effect are due to the fact that such a slow and gradual process of recognition can symbolize the desperate resistance of the consciousness to understanding a reality which is already audible but which the consciousness is reluctant to accept.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sounds Throw No Shadow</h3>
        <p>Auditive culture can be increased like any other and the sound film is very suitable to educate our ear. There are however definite limits to the possibilities of finding our way about the world purely by sound, without any visual impressions. The reason for this is that sounds throw no shadows—in other words that sounds cannot produce shapes in space. Things which we see we must see side by side; if we do not, one of them covers up the other so that it cannot be seen. Visual impressions do not blend with each other. Sounds are different; if several of them are present at the same time, they merge into one common composite sound. We can see the dimension of space and see a direction in it. But we cannot <em>hear</em> either dimension or direction. A quite unusual, rare sensitivity of ear, the so-called absolute—is required to distinguish the several sounds which make up a composite noise. But their place in space, the direction of their source cannot be discerned even by a perfect ear, if no visual impression is present to help.</p>
        <p>It is one of the basic form-problems of the radio play that sound alone cannot represent space and hence cannot alone represent a stage.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sounds Have No Sides</h3>
        <p>It is difficult to localize sound and a film director must take this fact into account. If three people are talking together in a film and they are placed so that we cannot see the movements of their mouths and if they do not accompany their words by gestures, it is almost impossible to know which of them is talking, unless the voices are very different. For sounds cannot be beamed as precisely as light can be directed by a reflector. There are no such straight and concentrated sound beams as there are rays of light.</p>
        <p>The shapes of visible things have several sides, right side and left side, front and back. Sound has no such aspects, a sound strip will not tell us from which side the shot was made.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Has A Space Colouring</h3>
        <p>Every natural sound reproduced by art on the stage or on the platform always takes on a false tone-colouring, for it always assumes the colouring of the space in which it is presented to the public and not of the space which it is supposed to reproduce. If we hear a storm, the howling of the wind, a clap of thunder, etc. on the stage we always hear in it the <em>timbre</em> proper to the stage not in the <em>timbre</em> proper to the forest, or ocean or what not the scene is supposed to represent. If, say, a choir sings in a church on the stage, we cannot hear the unmistakable resonance of Gothic arches; for every sound bears the stamp of the space in which it is actually produced.</p>
        <p>Every sound has a space-bound character of its own. The same sound sounds different in a small room, in a cellar, in a large empty hall, in a street, in a forest or on the sea.</p>
        <p>Every sound which is really produced somewhere must of necessity have some such space-quality and this is a very important quality indeed if use is to be made of the sensual reproducing power of sound! It is this <em>timbre local</em> of sound which is necessarily always falsified on the theatrical stage. One of the most valuable artistic faculties of the microphone is that sounds shot at the point of origin are perpetuated by it and retain their original tonal colouring. A sound recorded in a cellar remains a cellar sound even if it is played back in a picture theatre, just as a film shot preserves the viewpoint of the camera, whatever the spectator’s viewpoint in the cinema auditorium may be. If the picture was taken from above, the spectators will see the object from above, even if they have to look upwards to the screen and not downwards. Just as our eye is identified with the camera lens, so our ear is identified with the microphone and we hear the sounds as the microphone originally heard them, irrespective of where the sound film is being shown and the sound reproduced. In this way, in the sound film, the fixed, immutable, permanent distance between spectator and actor is eliminated not only visually, as already mentioned earlier in this book, but acoustically as well. Not only as spectators, but as listeners, too, we are transferred from our seats to the space in which the events depicted on the screen are taking place.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Basic Problem Of Sound Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Our sound apparatus records sound accurately and reproduces it with tolerable fidelity. But neither our microphones nor our loudspeakers can subjectively mould the sounds as the ordinary camera can influence the visual shape of things. If two cameramen of different artistic individuality photograph the same stormy sea, the visual pictures that result may be completely different. But the acoustic reproduction of the same stormy sea will be substantially the same, the only differences that may appear being due to technical causes. The sound engineer has no possibility of presenting the same sound in different ways, according to his own artistic personality. If two cameramen shoot the same scene, their pictures may resemble one another very little, although the objects in them may be equally recognizable in both. But sound tracks recorded by two sound engineers in the same technical conditions cannot show such individual differences.</p>
        <p>Why? Is it due only to the technical imperfections of our present-day recording apparatus or are there other deeper reasons inherent in the very nature of sound or the nature of our hearing?</p>
        <p>When a cameraman shoots the acting of an actor, as a visual phenomenon, there emerges a synthesis of two artistic performances: to the characterization by the actor is added the presentation by the cameraman who picks the most characteristic outlines and lightings out of a thousand different possible ones. The expression of the shot, its atmosphere, enhances the expression on the actor’s face, adds body and intensity to it. For this reason the cinematic shot does not merely reproduce, it also creates.</p>
        <p>But in a sound record there is no more and no less expression than is put into it by the voice of the actor and faithfully reproduced by the sound camera. The sound engineer does nothing more than record and reproduce; he cannot project the subjectivity of his own personality into the sound picture by means of viewpoint or set-up. But only the possibility of such subjective influences would afford the sound engineer scope for artistic self-expression. The shape and outline of sounds cannot be changed by varying perspectives as the physiognomy of visible things can be changed by varying angles. Sounds have no ‘angles’. The same sound coming from the same point cannot be recorded in different ways. But if the sound engineer has no free choice between many possibilities, his recording will remain a mechanical reproduction and nothing else.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sounds Cannot Be Represented By Images</h3>
        <p>What we hear from the screen is not an image of the sound but the sound itself, which the sound camera has recorded and reproduced again. It is the same sound that has been passed on to the screen. Sounds have no images. The sound itself is repeated in its original dimension with all its original physical qualities when it is echoed from the screen. There is no difference in dimension and reality between the original sound and the recorded and reproduced sound, as there is between real objects and their photographic images.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Montage</h3>
        <p>The formal problems of sound montage, the acoustic and musical rules which govern the effect of sounds are purely musical and acoustic questions and it is not proposed to discuss them here. What concerns us is only the part sound montage may play in film dramaturgy.</p>
        <p>For instance, the similarity of certain sounds may invite comparisons and evoke associations of ideas. In the film about Strauss, <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Great Waltz</em>, the rhythmic tap-tap of a trotting cab-horse evokes the rhythm of the waltz, to which the matutinal sounds of the Wienerwald provide the melody. In one of Ermler’s films the rattle of a sewing-machine evokes in the mind of a soldier who has lost his memory the rattle of a machine-gun and thereby conjures up the whole forgotten past.</p>
        <p>The linking of juxtaposed sub-contrasts may be more effective than the cutting together of visual contrasts. A thousand expressive effects can be produced merely by cross-cutting the sounds of sobs and laughter, groans and dance music, etc. Silence, as a sequel to sound, may also appear as an acoustic effect in sound montage. The reason for this is that sound does not disappear from our consciousness as quickly as a vanished visual picture. It echoes in our ear for some time, thus mutely counterpointing the subsequent pictures. After a sequence of hot dance music the stillness of a sick-room affects us differently than if the preceding picture, too, had been a quiet one. Sounds which, as the saying goes, ‘still resound in our ears’, may deepen and interpret the silence that follows them.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Sound Dissolves</h3>
        <p>The similarity of sounds renders possible the making of sound dissolves similar to picture dissolves. This is not merely a formal linkage—it may provide an essential, interpreting connection between two scenes. If the shouts ‘Down tools!’ ‘All out!’ dissolve into the rousing roar of the factory siren, the effect will be metaphoric; the siren will seem to us the angry voice of the factory. Such dissolves can become similes: if the tapping of a Morse key at the headquarters of an army in the field first grows louder, and then dissolves into the rattle of firearms, a causal, meaningful connection arises between the two sounds. The tapping of the Morse-key seems in retrospect to have been the command, which is carried out by the sound of firing. Such sound similes and acoustic symbols are often somewhat too obvious and can easily degenerate into empty formalism.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Asynchronous Sound Effects</h3>
        <p>A good traditional effect is achieved when the sounds of one scene are still heard during the next one. Instances: the jazz music of the night-club we have just seen can still be heard in the room where a dead man is lying; the roar of the open sea impinges on the sultry silence of a stuffy basement den in a great city. Or the other way round : we see a ploughman working in the fields but we can already hear in this picture the whirr and rattle of the factory machinery we are to see in the next, coming in from the neighbouring shot as it were; not a real neighbourhood, but a filmic neighbourhood, determined by the artistic composition of the film. Such anticipatory preparation increases tension and creates atmosphere.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">The Most Expressive Instrument</h3>
        <p>The asynchronous use of sound is the most effective device of the sound film. If recorded synchronously, sound is properly speaking merely a naturalistic complement to the picture. It simply makes the picture more like reality. But in asynchronous recording the sound grows independent of the image and can give a parallel meaning, a sort of running commentary to the scenes.</p>
        <p>In one of the Soviet war films there was a young soldier whose nerves give way when he first comes under fire. He deserts his comrades and hides in a shell-hole. A close-up shows his face and by his closed mouth we can see that he is silent. Nevertheless we hear him talking. The monologue we hear is in his mind and we listen tensely to what he is silently saying to himself. If he had really spoken aloud and said the same words in a voiced monologue, this scene would have been unbearable. For nowadays even on the stage we find an ‘unnatural’ monologue difficult to accept. But isn’t it even more unnatural that a human being should move across the ground with the speed of a car? As long as what we see remains close to reality, reality appears exaggerated. But if what we see is quite divorced from reality, it becomes fairytale or symbol. If a man has wings to fly with, he can compete even with an aeroplane; we no longer apply ‘natural’ standards. Asynchronous sound has no need to be natural. Its effect is symbolic and it is linked with the things it accompanies through its significance, in the sphere of the mind, not of reality. This richest and deepest possibility of artistic expression has as yet been used very little in the sound film. And yet its future development lies in this direction. It is this free, counterpointed use of picture and sound that could deliver the sound film from the fetters of primitive naturalism and enable our filmic art to attain once again the subtlety already achieved by the silent film in the past and then lost again through the advent of sound.</p>
        <p>In an asynchronous sound film the action can move on two parallel levels at the same time, in the sphere of sound and in the sphere of visual image. For instance : we can see what is ostensibly happening; at the same time we can hear what the persons involved in the action are thinking and feeling within themselves. Or the other way round: a narrator tells us what is happening; we need not even see it. What we do see is a sequence of thoughts, an irrational chain of associations. New art forms, the forms of the film-ballad and of lyrical film-poetry may possibly develop along these lines. We would hear the poem, accompanied by a cascade of pictures, a parallel, as it were, to a musical accompaniment but translated into the visual sphere; illustrations which have motion and which conjure up the mind-pictures of a soul moved by emotion.</p>
        <h3 class="notranslate" translate="no">Asynchronous Picture, Synchronous Scene</h3>
        <p>If we see a close-up of a listening human face isolated in a shot and hear some other person talking to it, then the shot will be asynchronous, even though the scene may be naturalistically synchronous. The sounds exist in the same rooms, but not in the same shot. Such a split may also have its contrapuntal effects. The spectator’s attention is riveted on a silent face and he sees quite different things with his eye than those about which he hears from a space outside the film frame. This again can give counterpointed effects impossible on the stage and equally impossible in the silent film.</p>
        <p>In his first sound film (in which he did not speak), Charlie Chaplin showed us a fine example of such an asynchronous effect. His beloved is singing in a hall and does not please the audience. The crowd in the vast hall is wrapped in icy silence. Only the clapping of one isolated pair of hands is heard. The camera pans, searching the crowd for the lone applauder. It searches for a long time among cruelly indifferent faces. But the applause grows louder. The camera is drawing closer. Finally it lights on Charlie, clapping away alone in a corner of the hall, fighting single-handed against the indifference of the crowd and against fate.</p>
        <p>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Party Crowd</em>, a film made by Pyriev, the Soviet director, there is another fine instance of such an effect. The heroine is expelled from the party by a show of hands at a committee meeting. We see her alone in close-up. We cannot see the hands raised in the vote and so we cannot at the first glance ascertain whether the majority is for her or against her. But we can hear the tellers count : ‘One, two, three . . .’ The heroine bows her head more and more. Tour, five, six . . .’ the figures crash down on the bowed head like hammer-blows. But we cannot see the final result, which we would of course have seen at a glance if the shot had been a longer one instead of a close-up. Only hearing the count permits us still to go on hoping, and because we can’t see the teller, his voice is magnified to the dimensions of an impersonal, inexorable destiny.</p>
